Bill won’t be prepared for his next Raddon meeting
Shelaghmichael will be mad and will therefore ask me a question at the next pricing meeting
the world will explode
our Small business strategic plan could be in jeopardy
some random vendor or consultant won’t be hired
I won’t find out what Small businesses truly want
