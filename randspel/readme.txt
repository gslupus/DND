Random Spell Generator 1.0
--------------------------

  Random Spell Generator is a generic (kind of) spell generator for 
any level based role-playing spell system.  The packaged spell list 
is an AD&D spell list with various sources.  Some corrections may 
need to be made (as far as spelling) to the list; some spells have 
bizarre names and spellings.

  To use the Random Spell Generator, simply put it and its support 
files in the same directory.  You can modify the spell list (as 
long as you keep to the basic format outlined inside the spell 
list) and can add as many more spells you would like.

  With this version, the text output result window is limited to 64k 
which should be enough to generate about 1600 spells without a 
problem.  With the next version, I'll probably increase this size. 
Everything else is dynamic, though.  I do believe the 2 lists 
(type and source) have a maximum size, but I don't know how big they 
can get -- that is a Windows limit as far as I can tell.  When you 
save a file, however, there is no size limit built into the program, 
so you probably won't run out of memory on that.

  If you make major changes to the spell list, and would like to 
share it with other people, you can e-mail it to me, and I can link 
it to my web page, or include it in future versions of the Spell 
Generator.

  I'm fairly new to Windows programming, and would like to hear any 
comments that you may have about my programs.  I would like to 
receive ideas for future versions and for new programs.

  If you use this program frequently, I'm asking for $5 to register 
it.  With registration, I'll notify you by e-mail of any future 
updates.
