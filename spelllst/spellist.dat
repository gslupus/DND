This  spell  summons  into  being a lert, which is a  small,  blue,  humanoid
creature. This creature is insubstantial, and thus can neither attack, nor be
attacked.  A  lert's main purpose is to alert the party members  of  imminent
danger. It can sense behind doors and around corners, and will telepathically
inform the wizard of any danger it senses, provided the wizard is awake.

This  spell  can suppress an ability of any creature or object. For  example,
the regenerating power of a troll, breath weapon of a dragon, petrifying gaze
of  a medusa, or level draining ability of a spectre can be suppressed if the
creature  fails its saving throw. The spell can also be cast on an object  to
remove  one  of  its  powers, such as the sharpness ability  of  a  sword  of
sharpness  or  the  wall of fire power of a wand of fire. An  object  in  the
possession  of  a creature gains that creature's saving throw; other  objects
must save versus disintegration to avoid the spell.
The  ability  or  power to be suppressed must be known in  some  detail.  For
example,  the wizard could suppress the fiery breath weapon of a  dragon,  as
long as the breath weapon was in some way fiery or fire based. Purely natural
effects, such as normal damage from a sword, cannot be suppressed.

When cast on a subject, this spell absorbs the next level drain attack on the
subject and is then used up. Eg., if the spell were cast on a target who  was
then later hit by two spectres in the same round, the first hit would only do
damage  and not drain levels but the second hit would drain levels as normal.
The material component of this spell is a bit of sponge.

This  spell allows the wizard to use hostile magic to recall previously  cast
spells.  Any time that the wizard successfully saves versus a spell,  he  can
use the magic to remember spells. The level of the spell saved against is the
number  of levels that can be remembered (if the wizard saves against a  6th-
level  spell,  he  can remember a 6th-level spell, or two  3rd-level  spells,
etc.).  This  ability  only recalls previously cast spells;  absorbed  points
cannot  be  saved  for  future  use. Area effect  spells,  innate  spell-like
abilities,  spells  that do not have a saving throw,  and  non-hostile  (DM's
discretion) spells are not affected by absorb spell.

This  spell  will  cause  a sheet of corrosive acid  to  fall  from  the  sky
(actually,  it  will appear 10 feet over the target spot). All  creatures  or
objects  underneath  will be subject to its effects. The  acid  will  corrode
wood,  metal, cloth, and flesh. The initial inundation will cause 1d6  damage
per level (with a maximum of 10d6). A successful saving throw will cause half
damage,  and  adds +1 to subsequent saving throws. All items exposed  to  the
acid  must also save. If a magical item saves successfully, no further saving
throws are necessary.
Armour  loses  one point of Armour Class per round. If it loses  all  of  its
points, it disintegrates and falls to the ground. Weapons lose one point  per
round.  The  number  of points is determined by size (large:  3,  medium:  2,
small: 1). When all points are gone, the weapon is too weak to use in combat.
All  damage  done  to items (other than loss of magical properties),  can  be
repaired  with a mend or the like, the item was destroyed. Subsequent  damage
to  flesh  is 1d6 per round. All subsequent damage can be avoided if  victims
immerse themselves in water, to wash off the acid.

The material components of this spell are rain water and sulphur.

When  this  spell is cast, it causes a cone shaped spray of  acid  to  extend
outwards  from the wizards hand. The length of the cone is 5 yards per  level
of the wizard and the cone terminates with a circular area with a radius of 2
yards per level of the wizard. The start of the cone is a circular area of  a
1-foot radius.
The damage from the acid is 1d4 + 1 per level of the wizard.

The  material component of the spell is a vial of acid which is thrown in the
direction which the cone will go.

      This  spell turns water into an acidic substance. If a creature touches
this stuff, it takes 2d4 points of damage. If the acid is drunk, it will take
4d4  points  of  damage. The wizard can do anything in or  to  the  substance
without  taking any damage. The material component is a drop  of  the  acidic
substance to be created.

Upon  casting this spell, a black bolt of energy shoots out form the wizard's
hand,  hitting one creature within its range. The creature struck  must  save
versus  spell  or immediately age 6d10 years. Any humanoid who is  aged  must
make a system shock roll or die from the internal strain. If a creature makes
its saving throw, it is still strongly disoriented, suffering a penalty of -2
to-hit and +2 to Armour Class for one round per level of the wizard.
Any  creature  that  is slowed, paralysed, charmed or stunned  suffers  a  -3
penalty  to  its  saving throw, since they are less able to resist  its  very
powerful  energy. The material component of this spell is a black opal  worth
at least 500 gp.

     With this spell, the wizard is able to perfectly duplicate the any style
of  handwriting of which he has a sizable sample. The forgery is good  enough
to  fool  even  the  closest scrutinisation, although it does  radiate  faint
magic.

      The  wizard merely casts the spell, and begins writing. His handwriting
will  perfectly  match  that of the sample, for the  length  of  the  spell's
duration.  Those watching the wizard write will believe that the  handwriting
on the page is actually that of the wizard, unless of course they witness the
casting of the spell, which may make them rather suspicious. The wizard  need
not  be  writing  the entire duration of the spell; he is free  to  stop  and
resume writing any number of times within the duration. Also, the wizard only
needs  the handwriting sample to be copied during the initial casting of  the
spell.

The  material component of this spell is the sample of the handwriting to  be
copied  (containing an example of every letter in the alphabet to  be  used),
and a writing instrument. The latter is not consumed in the casting.

      This  spell  affects any single intelligent being it is cast  upon.  By
intelligent being, it is meant any creature with a rudimentary form of spoken
language. This includes humans, demi-humans, humanoids, intelligent monsters,
etc.

      The  victim  receives a saving throw versus spell to avoid the  effect,
with  the  appropriate  adjustments due to Wisdom. If the  victim  fails  his
saving  throw, the victim's speech immediately becomes offensive to  all  who
can  understand the language the victim is using. The victim,  however,  only
hears what he thinks he is saying, and may become extremely curious as to why
everybody is mad at him. The words of the victim become so offensive that, in
fact, they act as a low-power taunt, with those hearing and comprehending the
victim's  speech making a saving throw versus death magic at +4, or  else  be
consumed  with  a mindless desire to bash the victim's head in.  Each  person
within  hearing  of  the victim will hear whatever would be  considered  most
offensive  by them. The wizard is the only one able to hear what is  actually
spoken by the victim, and is thereby immune to the taunt effect.

The  material  components of this spell are the command word,  and  a  subtle
pointing motion by the wizard, at the target.

     This spell creates a magic aura around an object similar to the one from
Nystul's  magical  aura. However, it hides not the magic  property,  but  the
alignment of the target. The wizard can specify which alignment he wants  the
object  to  radiate as well as the strength of the radiation. The higher  the
level  of the wizard the more radical alignment he could place on the  object
or  person. Note that this aura does not change the alignment (if present) of
a person or object.

      This spell foils such spells as detect good or detect evil, a paladin's
detect evil ability and know alignment. It does not change the effect of  the
protection from good or protection from evil. Note that the priest's  version
of  true seeing or a gem of seeing will see through this spell. If the object
or person acts in a different way than is indicated by the aura, other people
will  get a disbelieve check. A wizard with true seeing will now get  a  true
reading from a detect evil.

The  material  component  of  this spell is  a  sheet  of  thin  silk  in  an
appropriate colour to the alignment being cast. It is consumed completely.

With the utterance of a word, the priest can create a column of air that  can
perform two functions. Firstly, it can be used as a cushion if the priest  is
falling.  If  the  priest casts this spell while falling,  a  column  of  air
supports  him (and anyone in a 30-foot radius). This column slows his  decent
as  if he had fallen 60 feet less. If the distance fallen is 60 feet or  less
the  creatures  caught in the area of effect are set down on the  ground  (on
their feet, paws, etc.) at the end of the duration.
The  second use lifts people who are on the ground and buffets them  with  in
the  column. Creatures caught within the column are unable to cast spells  or
use  missile  weapons  but they can use melee weapons  at   4  and  creatures
outside  the column are at  2 to-hit those trapped inside, due to the  random
motion  of those inside. Also people outside the area of effect are not  able
to fire missile weapons through or into the column. If they use melee weapons
on  creatures within the column they must make a Strength check at +2 to hold
onto their weapon.

This  spell creates a force of air directed by two of the priest's arms.  The
line version of this spell creates a 90-foot "lance of air" which strikes the
target  if  the priest succeeds to hit AC 10 minus Dexterity adjustments  for
target.  The  force of the blow causes 3d6 points of damage  and  causes  the
target to make a Dexterity check with modifiers as below. This version  opens
doors as a 20 Strength.
The cone version has a width of 5 feet at the base and 60 feet at the end  of
the  cone,  and  a length of 60 feet. All in the area of the  cone  take  1d6
points  of  damage (save versus petrification to avoid) and are knocked  over
unless  they  make  a Dexterity check with a +1 modifier, also  applying  the
modifiers below.

Target    Modifier
is smaller than man sized      1
is larger than man sized +2
has Strength under 12     1
has Strength of 18  +1
has Strength of 19  +2
has Strength of 20  +3
has Strength over 20     +4
has 4 or more legs  +3
is under 100 pounds  2
is over 1000 pounds +2

Other modifiers may be applied at the DM's discretion, such as a target on  a
ledge,  off  balance, embraced, etc. This spell was originally created  by  a
thri-kreen who would use his bottom two arms to scoop up air and use his  top
two  arms to aim the lance. Similar somatic gestures should be used for  two-
armed creatures. The material component of this spell is a small fan which is
consumed in the casting.

The air priest uses this spell to summon a small flying animal that can serve
him as a messenger. The animal must have at least animal Intelligence and  be
within  range (a hawk, an eagle, etc.). The DM decides if one exists. If  the
animal  has more than 5 HD or possess more than 12 Intelligence,  it  gets  a
saving throw to negate the summons.
The  spell confers the animal a very limited ability to send thoughts, as per
the  telepathic  devotion. The caster can name a specific  person,  whom  the
animal  will  try to locate and deliver a small message, up to one  word  per
level of the caster.
The  specification  need not to be very specific. "The  mul  Farggon  in  the
merchant  district of Tyr" or "the human Kalarrog in Ledopolis" will suffice,
if  there is only one mul Farggon or only one human Kalarrog in these places.
Description  can  be  made more detailed, at the DM's  option  (common  sense
should be used, 40 or 50 words is usually the maximum).
To  deliver  the message, the animal must get closer than 10  feet  from  the
target, at which point the ability to send thoughts is activated. The  animal
is  then free to go as it wishes. Note that the target must be conscious  and
able to understand the sent thoughts, or the spell does not expire.
It  is  possible  for  the animal to be slain by natural predators  or  other
hazards,  as specified by the DM. Base chance is 10%, modified by  the  place
and time of the casting, the recipient's place and other such factors. It  is
possible  for the chance of failure to get as high as 80% or even more.  Note
that the caster does not learn if the messenger succeeded.
Casting  of this spell for any reason other than to deliver a message  is  an
evil  act  (if one summons the animal for food, for example). This spell  was
designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This  spell  creates  an area of pure, clean air in the location  the  caster
desires.  The air pocket appears in a 20-foot cube and remains stationary  in
the location it was cast. It cannot be made to move with the caster. The cube
is  self contained, and will keep out surrounding air or water. This makes it
a useful spell to cast underwater, in wildspace, or around poisonous gas. The
cube  will  only  keep  out  liquids,  gases,  and  outside  air.  Humanoids,
creatures,  and  objects can pass through freely. The air in  the  cube  will
remain fresh for the duration of the spell.

This  spell causes a great cloud of small, white, harmless but annoying flies
to  spring  forth.  These bugs are so dense as to obscure vision  within  the
cloud  to  only  2 feet. These albino fruit flies, while they  do  not  bite,
secrete a sticky, gooey substance, so that anyone caught within the cloud and
failing a saving throw will be affected as if by a slow spell.
While the cloud itself will only last for 2 rounds +1 round per level of  the
wizard,  the  effects of the sticky gunk on characters will last  until  they
manage to wash it off, a feat which requires at least half a gallon of  water
for a man-sized creature, and takes 1 turn. Using more water will reduce this
time, of course, and complete submersion in water will wash a character in  a
single  round.  These flies have an even worse effect on  vegetation.  Beings
made  from vegetable matter will take 1d3 points of damage per level  of  the
wizard  for  as  long as they remain within the cloud. Other vegetation  will
surely  be  eaten  within a few rounds, destroying gardens  or  forests,  and
probably greatly angering any nearby druids!

The  material  component of this spell is a live ash-white fly or  any  other
kind of small, harmless, but extremely annoying insect.

This  spell creates a wave of hardened ice which the wizard actively directs.
After  casting, the wizard simply taps the ground to activate the spell.  The
wave  of  ice begins where the wizard taps the ground, and reaches  its  full
dimensions after advancing only 10 feet. It travels at a speed of 40 feet per
round.  The  crest of the wave is 10 feet high and 15 feet  wide;  after  the
crest of the wave has passed, the remaining "trail" is only 3 feet high.
Creatures coming into contact with the crest suffer 2d6 points plus  1  point
damage per level of the wizard, or half this amount if the creature is  cold-
using  (in general, cold-dwelling creatures take half damage from this spell,
rounded  down, and cannot suffocate as a result of this spell). In  addition,
creatures of less than large size must save against paralysation or be buried
under  the  crest. Buried individuals take an additional 1d3 points  of  cold
damage  each  round  and  must initially make another  saving  throw  against
paralysation  or  start  to  suffocate under  the  ice  (use  the  rules  for
drowning).  Trapped creatures may break free, taking 1 more point  of  damage
per level of the wizard from sharp ice.
The  crest of the wave can be disrupted by 30 or more points of fire  damage,
or  negated by a wall of fire in any case. At the end of the spell  duration,
the crest of the ice wave immediately loses all momentum and melts; the spell
will cause no more damage, and trapped creatures can easily break free taking
no damage. The material components for this spell are a steel pin and a glass
of icewater.
Alcoreax  is  the headmaster of Talarin Niulivius, one of the better  magical
schools  on the continent of Niulivia. Alcoreax's icetrail is the only  spell
he has researched. This one took him over five years to develop.

      Once cast, a fan of flame shoots from the wizard's touching thumbs  and
outstretched hands. The fan reaches three feet forward from the  thumbs,  and
extends 60  to the right and left, gradually shortening until the fan  slopes
into  the wrists. The flames change colour depending on the power the is able
to put into them, and follow this chart:

      When cast upon the target, the spell seems to have no immediate effect.
When  a  simple condition is met (no ands/ors), a fanfare of no more than  40
beats is suddenly heard around the target. This fanfare can be as simple as a
single  trumpet blast, or as complex as an orchestral arrangement,  depending
on  the  components. The spell then "resets", and the next time the condition
is met, the music will play, resetting to the duration of the spell.

      The condition must be a simple one, and when the condition is met,  the
fanfare plays. The condition must be a simple "true or false" condition,  and
must  deal  with the target, such as "passes through door", "falls down",  or
"draws  weapon". Subjective conditions, such as "when a good  blow  has  been
given", won't work since the spell cannot determine the relative value.

      This  spell  may be layered, but the conditions must all be  different,
reusing a condition dispels the previous casting. Other magic may not be used
as  a  trigger, so this spell cannot be triggered directly by a  spell  (i.e.
"hit with fireball" won't work, but "catches fire" will).

The  material components are a cylinder made of wax, a needle, and a copy  of
the music, in the caster's race' standard musical notation. All are destroyed
in  the  casting. This copy of the music is the key to the complexity of  the
fanfare.  Up to 100 instruments may play at once, but the caster must  use  a
separate sheet for each instrument. The caster states which instrument  plays
each part as the spell is cast.

      If  the sheet music is not available, the caster may hum or whistle the
fanfare  when  casting, but the fanfare is then limited  to  one  instrument,
which replays the caster's notes.
The  more complex the fanfare, the longer the casting time. The base  casting
time  is  2,  plus  1  for each instrument that will sound.  Thus,  a  single
instrument  will have a casting time of 3, while a full 100 piece arrangement
will require 102 (about 10 rounds).

      If  the target is unwilling, then they may attempt a savings throw.  If
the  throw is successful, the fanfare sounds once around the wizard, and  the
magic  dissipates.  Once cast, the sound will definitely be  heard  by  those
within hearing range.

This spell, which functions only out of doors, causes thin streams of hissing
violet acid to fall within its area of effect. All within the area must  save
versus spell or suffer full damage. The spell inflicts 1d8 per two levels  of
the  wizard (rounded up). All exposed items in the area must also save versus
acid or be destroyed.
Characters  under heavy cover which is not destroyed by the  acid  are  fully
shielded from the effects of the spell. The acid, once it strikes the ground,
harmlessly  disappears. The material component for the spell is a small  vial
of aqua regia and a strip of zinc.

This  spell  grants the subject complete immunity to acid up to a point.  The
spell's  basic  duration is 10 rounds per level of the wizard.  However,  for
every  point  of acid damage that would have been suffered by  the  character
(after  saving  throws and any other protections have been  considered),  the
duration  of  this  spell is reduced by one round for  every  point  of  acid
neutralised  by  the spell. This spell also protects the subject's  equipment
from  needing to make any item saving throws versus acid for as long  as  the
spell  is  in effect. The material component is a small glass vial containing
lye and water.

      The spell causes a thin stream of purplish, hissing acid to shoot forth
from  the wizard's outstretched hand, out to the maximum range of the  spell.
This  acid  causes  1d4 points of damage per level of the  wizard,  up  to  a
maximum  of  8d4.  The  intended target may attempt  a  saving  throw  versus
petrification to dodge the jet of acid (save at -4 if size G, -2 if size H, -
1  if  size L, +1 if size S, and +3 if size T), and if successful the jet  of
acid  will have been avoided, and will continue on in a straight line out  to
the  extent of its range. Any creature in the path of the acid must  save  as
above  or be struck by the spell. The acid stream can affect only one  target
in any event. The material component is a drop of any acid.

This spell causes a sheet of dancing, shifting light to spring up around  the
wizard,  encompassing any area up to the maximum indicated  by  the  wizard's
level. The aurora borealis will last as long as the wizard concentrates on it
(concentration can be maintained while moving at half speed, but  the  wizard
cannot  fight  or cast other spells, though speech is allowed),  and  for  an
additional 1 round per level after he ceases concentration.
Any  intelligent creature which views the shifting, dancing patterns of light
must save versus spell or stand fascinated, watching the interplay of colours
and  lights (cf. hypnotic pattern). A maximum of 2 HD of creatures per  level
of the wizard can be so affected.
Any  creature actually touching the Aurora will suffer 2d6 points of  damage,
+1  point  per  level of the wizard. Fungoid monsters, undead, and  creatures
native  to the plane of shadow suffer 2d6 + 2 points per level of the  caster
of damage from the effects of this spell.

The  material  component of this spell is a clear gemstone or  crystal  prism
worth not less than 100 gp, a glowworm, and a pinch of phosphorus.

This spell draws upon a nearly colourless arcane effluvium from the plane  of
shadow.  This  mystical  stuff burns very hot and is extremely  viscous,  but
rapidly  dissolves in the thick substance of the prime material plane.  Those
in  the  area  of effect may attempt a saving throw versus breath  weapon  to
avoid  being  covered in the stuff. If this saving throw is successful,  they
are  merely  splashed with it. Even this small amount, however, is sufficient
to  cause half damage for the initial round, but it burns out in that  single
round.  Those  that fail to save and are struck fully by this  ghastly  stuff
suffer  1d6 fire damage per two levels of the wizard (rounded up),  up  to  a
maximum  of 12d6. The balefire clings to these poor victims and continues  to
inflict  damage. The damage is reduced by 2d6 each round, and  the  it  burns
until all damage potential is exhausted.
This  shadow-stuff burns with a colourless fire that can only be extinguished
by  magical  means  (eg., wand of flame extinguishing,  fire  quench,  dispel
magic, or a magical cold spell such as ice storm, cone of cold, wall of  ice,
or  Otiluke's freezing sphere, although spells involving ice may  also  cause
impact  damage to the would-be rescuee); even total immersion in  water  will
have  no  effect  on  it. This flame is so hostile to  natural  (i.e.,  prime
material)  matter that it will burn through one inch of wood or  soft  metal,
one quarter inch of hard metal, or one eighth inch of stone per die of damage
that it would inflict to living targets each round it is active.
Any  individual  who  is struck fully (i.e., fails to save)  must  make  item
saving  throws  versus magical fire for all exposed equipment in  each  round
that  the  balefire  clings to him, though these  saving  throws  are  at  +1
cumulative  for  each round after the first. Occasional  dark  green  or  red
flickerings can be observed in an active balefire. The material component  is
a standard opal (not a black or fire opal) worth at least 500 gp and a bit of
pitch.

The caster of this spell can create one to four spheres of glowing electrical
energy.  These  spheres resemble dancing lights (q.v.), and  the  wizard  can
control  them  in the same way. The spheres can be moved up to 120  feet  per
round.  Each  ball is about 5 feet in diameter, and any creatures approaching
within 5 feet will dissipate that ball's charge. The charge values are:

     Number of
     Lightning Balls     Damage Done
     1    4d12
     2    5d4 each
     3    2d6 each
     4    2d4 each

A  saving throw versus spell results in half damage, indicating that  contact
was across an air gap. Note that more than one creature approaching within  5
feet in a single round can be affected by the ball if that occurs.

By  extending  either  arm,  the wizard causes a fan-like  sheet  of  heated,
purplish,  acidic vapours and blue flames to leap forth from his outstretched
hand. Any creature in the area effect must save twice (once versus fire, once
versus acid) or suffer 1d6 per 2 levels of the wizard (rounding up) from each
effect.
All  exposed  items must save versus acid, regardless of the  result  of  the
saving  throw. Item saving throws versus magical fire are only  necessary  if
the a victim fails his saving throw versus that effect.

This  spell brings forth a wave of supernatural cold, rolling forth from  the
wizard's  outstretched arms to the maximum area of effect.  Its  cold  vacuum
kills  all  normal  vegetation in the area except for  trees,  which  have  a
50%-100%  chance  to  survive (DM's discretion,  based  on  size  and  native
environment). This cold inflicts 3d4 damage and the vacuum an additional  3d4
to  all  living  creatures within the area of effect. Vegetable  and  fungoid
monsters  suffer double damage from this spell. The material component  is  a
piece of ice.

This  spell  creates  a flaming missile with a trail of  superheated  noxious
gasses.  The  comet  unerringly strikes one target, the  impact  causing  3d6
points  of damage and the flames an additional 3d6. Furthermore, any creature
within 5 feet of the comet's path will suffer 2d4 points of fire damage.  All
those  within 5 feet of the point of impact will suffer 3d4 points of damage.
Anyone  who  suffers damage from this spell is also considered to  have  been
engulfed  in  the  noxious fumes, and will be at -2 on all rolls  (10%  spell
failure  chance) for 1d6 rounds due to coughing, choking, and blurred vision.
The material component is a ball of pitch mixed with sulphur and phosphorus.

This  spell  is exactly the same as the 2nd-level wizard spell darkness,  15-
foot  radius  (q.v.), except in that the wizard can see normally through  the
darkness  so created as if in normal lighting conditions. Alternatively,  the
wizard  can  bestow the visual benefits to another character by crushing  the
material  component and sprinkling the dust into the eyes of  the  recipient.
The  material component is a piece of coal or charcoal, which must be crushed
and  applied as above. Note that the spell only allows normal vision  through
the  darkness caused by the particular casting, and lends no benefit  towards
other darkness, either normal or magical.

      This  spell  causes  an arc of electricity to leap  from  the  wizard's
extended  fingertip. This electricity unerringly strikes one  target  of  the
wizard's  choice, inflicting 1d4 HP + 1 HP per level of the wizard (up  to  a
maximum of +12), with no saving throw. A target in metal armour or wielding a
large,  mostly  metallic weapon (any sword or battle axe, for  example)  must
save  versus spell and, if the saving throw is failed, the bonus (i.e.,  per-
level) damage inflicted by the spell is doubled.

Use  of this spell enables the wizard to transform the matter of a creature's
body  into  the  stuff of a particular elemental plane.  The  elemental  form
enables  the  character to engage in normal combat with an elemental  of  the
same  or  opposite form (i.e., water would allow combat versus water or  fire
elementals),  or an elemental creature, without needing a magical  weapon  to
hit.  It  also provides protection versus the same element as if  a  ring  of
warmth  (+2  on  saving  throws, -1 per die of damage,  regenerate  1  HP  of
elemental-caused damage per turn). The subject can also exist without  danger
on  the appropriate elemental plane, and can move normally there. It does not
empower  the  subject with perceptions not normally possessed  (for  example,
seeing  through  the rock of elemental earth), but it does prevent  elemental
damage.  A  character  possessing a ring of  elemental  command  who  assumes
elemental form of the same type gains the cumulative effects of both, and  is
empowered with senses on the appropriate plane as if in normal air.
If  this spell is cast on the prime material, the spell will last 1 turn  per
level  of the wizard. If cast on the appropriate elemental plane, or  in  the
border ethereal of that plane, it will last 12 turns per level. If cast while
on  an  elemental  or para-elemental plane different from the  form  assumed,
start  with  the base of 12 turns per level and halve the duration  for  each
plane removed. An elemental form in opposition to the plane the wizard is  on
(air versus earth, fire versus water) cannot be assumed at all.

The  material component is a small amount of the appropriate element on  hand
(a handful of clay or earth or a torch flame will suffice).

This spell is an improved version of the 2nd-level pyrotechnics spell (q.v.),
specifically  the fireworks application of that spell. That  portion  of  the
spell  functions  exactly  as the pyrotechnics spell  does  with  respect  to
duration,  area  of  effect, saving throw, and the blinding  effect  created.
However,  the fireworks created by this spell are more along the lines  of  a
geyser of brightly burning liquid fire, arcing upwards approximately 60  feet
into  the  air and raining down within a 30-foot radius area surrounding  the
perimeter  of  the basic fire source. All in this area of effect  suffer  2d6
fire  damage  with no saving throw allowed. Further, a central prominence  of
flame  is thrown upwards by this spell, and the wizard may direct this column
of  fire at a single target within 60 feet of the fire source. This plume  of
fire  will inflict 4d10 damage to the victim, although a saving throw  versus
breath weapon is possible to halve this damage.
The  liquid fire continues to burn during the following round, under the same
conditions  as during the first round, although the fire is less intense  and
causes  only  half the damage caused during the first round. Combustibles  in
the  area  of  effect  must save versus normal fire (if struck  only  by  the
burning spray) or magical fire (if the victim of the central plume fails  his
saving  throw or if the central plume is directed at an inanimate object)  to
avoid being set afire. A creature who is within the area of the spray who  is
targeted  by  the  central plume will not also suffer fire  damage  from  the
spray,  as  this  minor  flame is all but lost in the  fury  of  the  central
prominence.  The  spray does not fall within the area of  the  original  fire
source,  but  only  within 30 feet of the perimeter of the  fire  source.  An
aerial creature flying within 60 feet above the rising geyser of liquid  fire
is  affected  just  as a creature on the ground would be,  and  may  also  be
targeted  with  the  central plume, if the wizard so  desires.  The  material
component  for  this spell is a lump of pitch mixed with sulphur,  saltpetre,
and magnesium, as well as an existing fire source.

This  spell is similar to the 4th-level Alpha's firefall spell, but  is  more
powerful  in two ways. First, the spray of liquid fire burns for a  total  of
three rounds, inflicting 3d6 damage the first round, 2d6 the second, and  1d6
the third. There is no saving throw versus the damage inflicted by the spray.
Secondly,  the wizard is able to throw up one prominence of flame  (for  4d10
fire  damage the first round, and 2d10 the second, with a saving throw versus
breath  weapon for half damage) for every six levels of the wizard  (rounding
off  all  fractions). The material components are a lump of  pitch,  sulphur,
saltpetre, magnesium, and an available fire source.

This  spell  conjures an extra-dimensional black flame to surround  a  single
object or creature within range. This fire has exactly the opposite effect of
normal  fire, in that it restores creatures or objects burned to  destruction
by  fire  or acid to their original state. This will not restore  life  to  a
person slain by a fireball, but it will restore the body to full health, such
that  a  raise  dead  will bring the character back to full  physical  health
(though  an  amount of time equal to the time dead must be  spent  recovering
from the psychological shock). Similarly, it will not restore enchantment  to
a  once  destroyed magic item, though a limited wish is capable of  restoring
the lost enchantment to the item reconstructed by the flames of Falroth.
In  order to restore an item or creature, the target must fail a saving throw
of  the  same  type  that  resulted  in its destruction.  Hence,  plate  mail
destroyed  by  the breath of a black dragon must fail a saving  throw  versus
acid,  and an adventurer felled by a fireball must fail a saving throw versus
spell. For effects against which there is no saving throw (for example,  wall
of  fire),  assume  the  saving  throw to be as  against  breath  weapon  for
creatures  or  magical fire for items. It is thus more difficult  to  restore
items that were more difficult to destroy in the first place. One such saving
throw  may be attempted each round, and as many saving throws as desired  may
be  attempted  during the uof this spell. No object can ever be  affected  by
this  spell after the spell has been used on it once, whether or not  it  was
successful. Once the saving throw is failed, the object will take 2 rounds to
be  fully reconstructed from its remains. The flames of Falroth may be  moved
to another object or creature at any time during the spell's duration, with 1
round of concentration on the part of the wizard.
The flames of Falroth are very hostile to ordinary fire. They may be used  as
a  fire  extinguisher of sorts, and will extinguish a 10-foot cube of  normal
flame  every round. Magical fire spells must be checked as per dispel  magic,
but  multiplying  the  wizard's level by 2 for the  purposes  of  determining
whether  the target spell has resisted the effects of the flames of  Falroth.
If this dispelling attempt is unsuccessful, the flames of Falroth will vanish
back from whence they came.
If cast at an elemental fire creature of any sort, the flames of Falroth will
automatically  cause 6d6 damage to that creature. After this initial  attack,
the target creature may make a saving throw versus spell at 3. If successful,
the  flames  disappear without causing further harm. If failed, however,  the
flames  continue to attack the creature's very substance, causing 3d6  damage
every  round.  A new saving throw is allowed each round, the chance  to  save
improving  by 1 each round (-2 after the second round, then -1,  etc.).  This
continues until the creature is dead, the wizard moves the flames away (after
which  time  that  creature  will no longer be  affected  by  the  flames  of
Falroth); or until the spell expires or a saving throw is made - in  both  of
these cases, the flames disappear.
A  fire-using  or dwelling creature that uses fire but is not native  to  the
elemental  plane  of  fire (for example, a fire giant, a  red  dragon,  or  a
chimera)  will not be harmed by the flames of Falroth, but any external  fire
powers  (fire breath, spells, immolation, etc.) will cause only  half  normal
damage,  as  their  effectiveness is mitigated by the  flames.  The  material
component is a bit of green wood, a handful of ashes, a smoky quartz crystal,
and a piece of obsidian.

This  spell  sheathes the wizard in hot yellow flames and blurs the  wizard's
features  somewhat,  causing them to assume a smooth and somewhat  indistinct
shape,  also turning a dark red colour. The flames will appear to be  present
even  coming out of the wizard's eyes and mouth. These flames give the wizard
no  special  protection, but they do shed bright light in a  30-foot  radius.
Furthermore, any creature striking the wizard with a claw, bite,  or  similar
attack  or  a  hand-held weapon less than 5 feet long will suffer  damage  as
though contacting a wall of fire (q.v.) - 2d6 points of damage + 1 point  per
level  of  the wizard. Undead suffer double damage, and creatures  especially
susceptible to flame may also take additional damage.
The  wizard  may  attempt a melee attack to burn others  with  this  fire,  a
successful blow causing 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per two levels of  the
wizard.  Creatures  passing within a 5-foot radius of the wizard  suffer  1d4
points  of  heat damage. By standing still and concentrating, the wizard  may
extend  this  heat radiation, inflicting 2d4 within a 5-foot radius  and  1d4
within  a  10-foot radius, but this falls back to the usual level if thwizard
stops concentrating or resumes moving.
The  wizard  can  attempt  to  destroy inanimate objects  by  touching  them,
requiring a saving throw versus normal fire to avoid destruction. This may be
attempted  once  per round, at a -1 cumulative penalty for  each  consecutive
round of handling. Items on the wizard's person at the time of the casting of
this  spell  are  unaffected  by the flame. The wizard  may  end  this  spell
prematurely if desired. The material component for this spell is a  flask  of
oil,  poured over the wizard's head during the casting of the spell,  and  an
open flame of any size.

This  spell  calls down a bolt of reddish-purple lightning  which  strikes  a
single  creature  within range. The bolt inflicts 1d6 points  of  damage  per
level  of  the  wizard. Cold or water-based creatures suffer an additional  1
points  of  damage per die, while creatures resistant to heat or  electricity
suffer half normal damage (¬ with a successful saving throw). All non-magical
metal  worn  by  the target must save versus lightning (at +2 if  the  saving
throw was made, but at -2 if the saving throw was failed) or be fused to  any
nearby  metal  (sword  fused to gauntlet, pieces of  armour  fused  together,
preventing  movement). The material component of this spell is a short  glass
rod, a bit of fur, and a bit of iron or lodestone.

      This spell calls a canine creature to be a helper and boon companion to
the  wizard for the duration of the spell. The type of hound summoned depends
upon the wizard's level, but the hound will always understand verbal commands
given  it,  so long as they are 12 words or less and relatively  simple.  The
hound  will further also be capable of tracking as a ranger of half the level
of  the  summoner, and can hunt sufficiently well to feed the wizard for  one
day, provided there is game existant in the wizard's area.

     The type of hound summoned is as follows:

Wizard's Level    Hound
---------------------------
1-3               jackal
4-7               wild dog
8-12              wolf
13+               dire wolf

      If  the  wizard takes a lower-level hound (or a dire wolf  when  he  is
eighteenth level or higher), it will have maximum hit points, gain a  +1  to-
hit  and  on  damage, track at +1 level, and can understand  even  relatively
complex  commands of up to 50 words in length. The material  component  is  a
piece of fresh meat.

This  spell  summons into the wizard's vicinity a pack of  canines  who  will
fight  on behalf of the wizard, if such is required. The composition  of  the
pack will be as follows:

     D100 Roll Pack
     01-10     4d4 jackals
     11-60     3d4 wild dogs
     61-90     2d4 wolves
     91-00     1d4 dire wolves

The pack will follow commands to the best of its ability, so long as they are
relatively simple (attack, return, heel, etc.). If attacked by the wizard  or
his  fellows, all creatures summoned will instantly disappear. The hounds can
track  as  well as a 5th-level ranger, and can be commanded to  perform  this
activity  if  it is requested of them (such as by allowing them to  smell  an
article  of clothing from the creature to be tracked, etc.). The hounds  will
arrive  1d10  rounds after the spell is cast. The material components  are  a
piece  of  fresh, uncooked meat and a finely crafted silver or ivory  hunting
horn, worth not less than 100 gp, which must be sounded during the casting of
the spell.

With this spell, the wizard opens a small hole in the spatial fabric into the
supernatural cold of the para-elemental plane of ice. It brings forth a shaft
of  solid  para-elemental ice 6 inches thick and 10 feet long  (the  hole  is
opened  for  only  a  very brief time). This missile hits with  great  force,
causing  3d10  points of damage from the impact alone. If  the  target  saves
versus  petrification, only a glancing blow is dealt, and the victim  suffers
only 1d10 points of damage.
An  additional saving throw (also versus petrification, and at +4 if  only  a
glancing  blow was suffered) must be made, or the victim will be stunned  for
1d6 rounds from the force of the blow.
The  ice absorbs heat from the nearby air, and this causes 1d6 points of cold
damage  (no saving throw) to all within 5 feet of the bolt's path, and within
a  10-foot radius of the target creature. The bolt shatters upon striking its
target,  and  the victim will suffer an additional 4d6 points of cold  damage
(2d6 if only a glancing blow was suffered).
Fire-using  creatures take double damage from the cold caused  by  the  bolt,
while those resistant to cold take none. Both types of creatures suffer  full
damage from the bolt itself.
Water-based creatures in liquid form will suffer only 1d10 points  of  damage
from  the blow, and cannot be stunned, but they will automatically be  slowed
for 2d4 melee rounds.
If  the  target  creature  is struck fully (i.e., fails  the  initial  saving
throw),  then  exposed items on that side of the wizard must  make  a  saving
throw  versus  crushing blow, and all items carried by the wizard  must  save
versus  magical frost (note also that items on the side struck  by  the  bolt
must save at -10, due to the cold and the blow).

The  material component of this spell is a clear gem worth not less than  100
gp.

This  spell is similar to the 2nd-level mirror image spell (q.v.). The wizard
gains  1  mirror  image  for each level of experience,  rather  than  rolling
randomly. These images can appear anywhere within 15 feet of the wizard,  and
a  blurring distortion effect occurs in the casting of this spell and at  the
end  of  each melee round which prevents isolation of the true wizard in  the
new melee round, even if the wizard was successfully attacked in the previous
round.  Area  effect  attacks (fireball, for example) can  still  affect  the
wizard  even if his location is not known. As a final benefit, if one of  the
images  is  struck  by an opponent, the wizard may make an unmodified  saving
throw versus breath weapon. If successful, the image will not be dispelled by
the blow. The material component of this spell is a small carving or doll  of
the wizard and a broken mirror.

#9#
In  the  casting  of this spell, the wizard must choose one element  to  have
dominance over. Elementals of this plane cannot approach within 5 feet of the
wizard or attack the wizard in any way. The wizard can forego this protection
if  desired, and attempt to charm the elemental (cf. charm monster), applying
a  -2 penalty to the saving throw. If this is attempted, than this total ward
against elementals is lost.
In  any event, any elemental creature (water weird, xorn, etc.) is at -1  to-
hit  and -1 per die of damage when attacking the wizard. The wizard makes all
saving throws versus their attacks at +2. The wizards own attacks are  at  +4
to-hit  (or -4 to the target's saving throw) and +6 to damage. He can further
affect  any  elemental creature with any weapon, regardless of its  level  of
enchantment.
The  wizard may converse with creatures of the chosen element, and they  will
respect him if alignments are similar, or fear (if the wizard appears strong)
or  hate  and  desire to slay (if the wizard appears weak) if alignments  are
dissimilar.
The spell's association with one element results in a saving throw penalty to
the  wizard  while  the spell is in effect, depending  on  which  element  is
chosen:

     Element   Saving Throw Penalty
     Air  -2 versus fire
     Earth     -2 versus petrification
     Fire -2 versus water or cold
     Water     -2 versus electricity

The material component is a substantial amount (at least 1 cubic foot) of the
element in opposition to the element the wizard desires to dominate.

The  subject  of this spell cannot be wearing metal armour of any  sort,  nor
carrying a metallic weapon larger than a shortsword. Bracers are permissible.
The  creature touched is completely protected from electrical damage  of  any
sort  so  long  as the spell is in effect. This protection is  not  absolute,
having  a  maximum absorption of 10 points of electrical damage per level  of
the wizard. Damage is absorbed by the lightningarmour after saving throws and
any other protections have been taken into account.
A  creature  under  the effects of this spell carries a  negative  electrical
charge,  and  skin-to-skin  contact with  another  creature  will  cause  1d4
electrical  damage with no saving throw, as will contact through a conductor.
Anyone  striking  the protected creature with a conductive object  must  save
versus paralysation at +1 or drop the object due to temporary numbness in the
member holding the weapon. Those within 5 feet of a character with this spell
in effect may catch a faint scent of ozone and feel their hair standing a bit
on  end.  The  material component of this spell is a bit of copper  wire  and
glass thread wrapped in clay.

This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into being at
any  point  within the range of the wizard. Vision through the  wall  by  any
means  is  quite impossible, though it is negated by a darkness (q.v.)  spell
cast at it. When the wall first comes into being, all those within 10 feet of
it  who  are not averting their eyes (thus a wizard could warn his companions
that  he  was  about  to  cast this spell) must make a  saving  throw  versus
petrification  to  avert  their gaze from the wall in  time  to  avoid  being
dazzled  by its brightness. This dazzling results in a -2 penalty  to-hit,  a
20%  spell  failure chance for wizards, and a -1 penalty on  initiative  dice
rolls. These effects persist for as many rounds as the difference between the
victim's  die  roll  and the roll needed for him to save. These  effects  can
persist even after the duration of the spell has elapsed.
Naturally,  blind or sightless creatures are unaffected by  this  spell,  but
subterranean or dark dependent creatures (drow, duergar, or svirfneblin,  for
example)  suffer a -3 on their saving throw. Further, they are not  protected
by  their normal magic resistance, as the spell is not cast directly at them.
They are as vulnerable to its existence as any other creature would be.
The light given off is equivalent to a continual light (q.v.) spell within 20
feet,  and  equivalent  to  a light spell (i.e.,  normal  torchlight)  in  an
additional 80-foot radius. The lightwall, if cast outdoors, can be seen up to
a  mile  away per level of the wizard (reflecting the additional  size  of  a
larger wizard's lightwall). The wall can, of course, be created smaller  than
the maximum size for the wizard's level.
The wall itself causes no damage to creatures passing through it. However,  a
character fighting someone with a lightwall directly behind him suffers a  -1
on his chances to-hit (note that this is cumulative with the dazzling effects
described  above). Similarly to the 1st-level wall of darkness (q.v.),  sound
is  blocked by the lightwall, assuming that it does not allow sound waves  to
travel  around the sides of it (as when cast outdoors, for example). It  does
not  absorb sound or prevent spellcasting, it merely does not allow sound  to
pass  through it (even if such sound is from a horn of blasting  or  a  shout
spell).  The  material component is a clear gemstone or a sunstone  worth  no
less than 100 gp.

There  must be some ambient light available in order for this spell to  work.
The  effectiveness of this spell is determined by the amount of ambient light
available.  The wizard must concentrate for a full round to focus  the  light
into  the lucent lance, after which its energy may be released. The power  of
the lance is such that it can carve through wood or soft metal up to 4 inches
thick,  stone  up to 1 inch thick, or hard metal up to .25 inch  thick,  this
thickness  multiplied by the appropriate modifier on the table  below.  Items
carried by a living creature are partially protected by that creature's aura,
and  gain  a  saving throw versus magical fire (modified as  to  avoid  being
damaged by the lance. Living creatures suffer a base of 1d6 points of damage,
modified as below, with a maximum upper limit of not more than 1d6 per  level
of  the  wizard.  The lucent lance coalesces as a ball of  light  around  the
wizard's hand holding the material component, and shoots forth until  maximum
range  is  reached  or  until a sufficient thickness of material  blocks  its
progress.  The  Lucent Lance may be traversed over an arc up to  1  foot  per
level  of  the wizard at its maximum range. The wizard's hand glows  brightly
while the spell is being cast and while it is active.

If  the  light source used is a fire of some sort, that fire has a 50% chance
of  going  out.  A  permanent light effect (a magical sword  or  dagger,  for
example) will lose its power to shed light for 1d10 rounds. A spell  used  as
the  light source will be automatically dispelled if it's a spell  of  up  to
third  level,  and will have its duration cut by 25% if it's a  higher  level
spell. The material component is a small, oblong corundum rod worth at  least
100 gp.

      This  spell creates an area of soft blue-grey light, apparently  coming
downwards from above. This light effectively washes out all colour, but clear
vision  is  certainly  possible within the area of  effect.  Vision  is  also
possible  out to 10 yards beyond the spell's radius, but such vision  is  dim
and  shadowy  at  best.  The moonlight does not interfere  in  any  way  with
infravision,  but  the nature of the light is such that  creatures  adversely
affected  by  bright light suffer only half the normal penalties when  within
the  moonlight  and none when within its shadowy fringes.  Moonlight  may  be
centred on the wizard, in which case it moves with him. Otherwise, the  spell
must  be  cast on an area and is stationary. The material component  of  this
spell  is  a moonstone that has been exposed to actual moonlight for  a  full
night.

By the use of this spell, the wizard calls upon the magical influences of the
other-dimensional moons of Munnopoor. The wizard can call upon the  power  of
one,  two,  or all three of the moons. This spell always creates an  area  of
light  equal  to the moonlight spell, centred on the wizard and  moving  with
him. However, the area of effect is only 50% that of the normal moonlight  if
one  moon's power is invoked, 100% normal is two moons are called  upon,  and
150%  normal if all three moons are utilised. This moonlight has all  of  the
effects  of  actual  moonlight  under  a  full  moon,  including  effects  on
lycanthropes. The duration of this spell is also determined by the number  of
moons  called  upon: if one moon, the duration is 2 rounds per level  of  the
wizard; if two, it's 1 round per level; and, if all three, it's 1 round per 2
levels  of  the  wizard. Besides the light produced  by  the  images  of  the
appropriate moons appearing above the wizard, each moon provides  a  specific
magic-enhancing effect as follows:
Blue moon. All water-related (including fog-, ice-, and steam-related) spells
used by the wizard gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage (though not exceeding
the normal maximum - eg., an ice storm spell would inflict 3d10+3 damage,  up
to a maximum of 30) if the spell causes physical damage, including the damage
caused  by  summoned water elemental creatures; applies a penalty  of  -4  to
saving  throws and -20% to magic resistance to targets of spells which  cause
no  hit  point  damage  but do affect an unwilling target  in  some  way;  or
increases  the duration of other spells of this genre which do not fall  into
the  above categories (eg.: water breathing, wall of fog), doubling  duration
if  it  is  a 1st- up to 3rd-level spell, increasing by 50% if the  spell  is
fourth up to sixth level.
Bright  moon.  All  spells relating to stars, moons, and  other  astronomical
phenomena are affected in the same way that water-related spells are affected
by the blue moon.
Silvery moon. All mind-controlling and influencing spells used by the  wizard
apply  a  -4  penalty to saving throws and a -20% penalty to magic resistance
checks by targets of such spells.

The  material  components for this spell are a white  pearl  or  sapphire  to
invoke  the blue moon, a diamond for the bright moon, and a silver  pearl  or
moonstone  for  the silvery moon. Whatever the combination of moons  invoked,
the  spell  also requires a piece of black velvet along with a crushed  pearl
and a crushed moonstone, and a pinch of diamond dust.

This  spell  can only be cast outdoors at night. It calls down  a  number  of
flaming meteorites to strike unerringly any targets within range. The  wizard
can  call  down  1d4  meteorites,  plus another  for  every  five  levels  of
experience  (1d4+1  at  5th-9th, 1d4+2 at 10th-14th,  etc.).  Each  meteorite
strikes  a  single target, though more than one may strike any given  target.
Each  of  these "Leonids" comes blazing down from the heavens,  striking  for
1d6+1  points of impact damage and an additional 1d6+1 points of fire damage.
The material component for this spell is a bit of meteoric iron.

     This spell draws upon the power of the quasi-elemental plane of radiance
and  brings forth a beam of pure light. The colour of the light making up the
beam  is normally randomly determined by a roll of a 1d8. However, the wizard
has  a chance equal to 5% per level of being able to select the colour of the
beam  (the wizard may not select a multi-hued beam. Such occurs only  as  the
result  of  an  aberration in the magic). The colours of  the  beams  are  as
follows:

D8 Roll    Colour of Beam
--------------------------------------------------------
1          red (cold)
2          orange (heat)
3          yellow (acid)
4          green (poison)
5          blue (electrical)
6          indigo (holy water)
7          violet (force)
8          multi-hued beam - roll twice, ignoring eights

      The beam does a base of 2d6, plus an additional hit point of damage for
each  level of the wizard (eg., a 7th-level wizwould inflict 2d6+7 points  of
damage). Any creature resistant to the attack form indicated by the colour of
the  beam takes no damage, while a creature vulnerable to the specific attack
form  (such as heat versus a yeti) will suffer double damage. A saving  throw
indicates  that  the beam has missed and the intended victim  is  unaffected.
Note  that  the beam may hit a target other than the one intended.  Once  the
beam  hits a solid object, it stops, even if that object is transparent.  Any
creature  suffering  damage from the spell must make item  saving  throws  if
appropriate.  The  material component of the spell is a small  clear  gem  or
crystal prism worth at least 50 gp.

This  spell is very much like the 2nd-level rainbow beam spell, but  is  much
more powerful. Besides a slightly larger area of effect, and the fact that  a
solid object will not stop the beam unless larger than 2 feet wide and formed
of  solid  stone or some such similar dense material, i.e., the beam  is  not
stopped  by  mere flesh, even if armoured, but would be stopped  by  a  stone
wall.
The spell does 1d6 HP of damage + 1 HP per level of the wizard. The swirling,
coruscating tendrils of multihued light also have properties as listed  under
the  rainbow beam spell. A target resistant to one or more of these forms  of
attack takes one less point of damage per die per attack that it is resistant
to. The opposite applies for creatures that are particularly vulnerable to  a
certain form of attack (for example, a frost giant is immune to cold, but  is
not  particularly  vulnerable to fire, so it would take  one  less  point  of
damage per die. A green slime, vulnerable only to fire and cold, would take 5
fewer  points  of damage per die). The indigo (holy water) beam  does  normal
damage except to creatures affected by unholy water (paladins, lammasu, etc.,
who  are  considered  being  resistant), and those  affected  by  holy  water
(undead, demons, etc., who are considered specifically vulnerable).
The  victim  is  entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful,  indicates
that  the  beam  has missed. It may hit another target, though.  Also,  if  a
target  is struck by the beam, he must save versus petrification or be struck
in the face and blinded for 1d4+2 rounds.

The  material component for this spell is a small diamond worth not less than
100 gp.

This  spell  invokes  energy and the spirit of a  creature  from  the  quasi-
elemental  plane of radiance. The rainbow warrior has as many hit  points  as
the  wizard  would  at  full health, and attacks as a  fighter  of  half  the
wizard's level. The warrior has an Armour Class of 0, and can only be  struck
by  magical weapons. It attacks with a spear of radiance, which causes damage
the  same way as the 2nd-level rainbow beam if the target is struck. As  with
that  spell, the wizard has a 5% per level chance of selecting the colour  of
the  spear, otherwise it is random. The rainbow warrior may fly at a movement
rate  of  24,  but it has no real substance and cannot touch  nor  carry  any
material object.
Creatures  dwelling on or drawing power from the negative material  plane  or
plane of shadow suffer 1d6 damage every round that they are within 20 feet of
the  rainbow  warrior, as it sheds a bright globe of light  strongly  infused
with  energy  from  the  positive  material plane.  The  rainbow  warrior  is
unaffected  by poison, paralysis, petrification, fire, electricity,  gas,  or
acid.  Unholy  water causes it 2d4 damage, and cold attacks  do  full  normal
damage.
Negative energy attacks gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage, and any  spells
involving  darkness cause the rainbow warrior 2d6 points of damage per  level
of  the  spell, but the darkness will be dispelled. Any darkness spell coming
into  contact with the 20-foot globe of light surrounding the rainbow warrior
must  be checked as if dispel magic was cast at the level of the summoner  of
the  warrior. Only one such dispelling attempt is possible for each  darkness
spell  that could be affected, although the warrior can automatically  dispel
any  darkness spell by touching the area of effect, but it will suffer damage
as  if  the  spell had been cast specifically at him. Dark-dwelling creatures
(eg.  drow, duergar) are affected by the rainbow warrior's globe of light  as
they  would be by continual light. The material component of this spell is  a
clear diamond worth no less than 5000 gp.

The  wizard extends his arm, points his finger, and speaks a word to cast the
spell.  A  thin, light blue ray leaps from the wizard's finger. The  intended
target  must  save versus petrification. If the saving throw is  failed,  the
creature is struck by the beam and, unless the creature possesses some innate
magic  resistance, is paralysed for 2 rounds per level of the wizard. If  the
saving throw is made, the pencil-thin ray has missed its original target  and
continues  on in a straight line to the extent of its range. Any creature  in
the  path  of  the  beam must make the same saving throw  or  be  struck  and
paralysed.  If the ray actually strikes, there is no saving throw versus  its
effects.  Size L creatures must save at -1, size H at -2, and size G  at  -4.
Conversely, size S creatures save at +1 and size T at +3. The ray can  affect
only target in any event. The material component is a clear gem or a piece of
amber worth at least 100 gp.

The wizard need but throw his arms heavenward and a great rolling thunderclap
will sound directly overhead. All creatures within 10 feet of the wizard must
save  versus  petrification or be knocked prone, suffering  1d4+1  points  of
damage,  and  are  automatically stunned for 1 round and deafened  for  1d4+1
rounds. Those within one-half the radius of the spell (for example, within 25
feet of a 10th-level wizard) but not within 10 feet must save versus spell or
be  stunned for 1 round, and are automatically deafened for 1d4+1 rounds. All
others in the area of effect must save versus spell or be deafened for  1d4+1

This  spell  ionises the air around the target of the spell, surrounding  him
with  a  blue-white, glowing nimbus of electrically charged air in  a  5-foot
radius. The target of the spell may save versus breath weapon at -2 to  avoid
the spell. This saving throw is at an additional -2 if the target is carrying
large,  mostly  metallic  weapons  (eg.:  swords,  battle  axes)  or  wearing
partially  metallic armour (eg.: studded leather, ring mail), and  at  -4  if
wearing full metal armour (scale mail or heavier). If successful, the  target
will  suffer  only  3d6 electrical damage as he dodges out  of  the  area  of
effect,  and  the  spell will then dissipate that round without  a  focus  to
coalesce  about.  If the saving throw is failed, the victim will  suffer  5d6
damage  every round until a saving throw versus breath weapon (with modifiers
as for the initial saving throw, but with a +1 cumulative per round bonus) is
successful, at which point the spell will dissipate.
Any  creature entering the 5-foot radius nimbus suffers 1d6 electrical damage
with  no saving throw. Any creature that touches or is touched by the  victim
of  the spell will suffer 3d6 damage with no saving throw if the contact  was
skin-to-skin,  or  2d6 if it was through a conductor. If  the  target  is  in
water, the electricity will inflict 3d6 damage with any contact, 2d6 within 5
feet,  and  1d6  within 15 feet. The target of this spell  may,  if  desired,
intentionally  try  to  use  the  nimbus  of  electricity  and  the  personal
electrical charge as a weapon. The wizard may end this spell at any point, if
desired. The material components are phosphorus, a bit of fur, amber,  and  a
bit of cold iron.

This  spell calls forth a seething black ray shot through with veins of green
fire. All creatures in the path of the spell will suffer 1d4 damage per level
of  the  wizard,  up to a maximum of 20d4. A successful saving  throw  versus
breath  weapon will result in only half damage. A creature that is immune  to
fire  or  to  energy  drain will suffer only half  damage  (a  quarter  if  a
successful  saving  throw is made). If the damage rolled exceeds  a  target's
remaining hit points, that target is disintegrated. The material component is
a black opal worth at least 500 gp.

This spell creates a very bright flashing jolt of sheet lightning within  the
area  of effect. All those in the area receive 4d4 electrical damage with  no
saving  throw.  In  addition, those within must save versus petrification  to
avoid  being  blinded for 1d3 rounds and must save versus  breath  weapon  to
avoid  being  stunned for 1d3 rounds. Those carrying large,  mostly  metallic
weapons (for example, swords or battle axes) or wearing partial metal  armour
(studded  chain)  save at -2 versus the stunning and suffer  +1  per  die  of
damage. Those in full metal armour (splint mail or better) save at -4  versus
the stunning and suffer double damage. The material component is a bit of fur
and sheet of fine crystal worth at least 50 gp.

This  spell  creates glowing missiles with flaming trails, one for  each  six
levels  of  the  wizard (dropping all fractions). The  victim  of  the  spell
receives no saving throw, and suffers 4d6 damage from the impact and 8d6 from
the  fiery blast that accompanies the impact. All within 5 feet of the impact
point  are  also in the blast radius, but they may save for half damage.  The
originally intended target may attempt to save versus petrification to  avoid
being  struck, this saving throw being at -4 if within 20 feet and at  -2  if
within  40  feet.  If this saving throw fails, he suffers  as  above.  If  he
succeeds,  however, the shooting star(s) directed at him  continue  on  in  a
straight line to the extent of their range, at which point they explode in  a
fiery  burst  as above. Anyone else in the path of the shooting star(s)  must
save as for the original intended target, or become the victim of the spell.
If the wizard has more than one missile, he may direct them at one or several
targets  as  desired. Anyone within 5 feet of the path of  the  missile  will
suffer 2d6 (save for half) fire damage simply from the heat of the passage of
the  shooting star. The material component is a bit of meteoric  iron  and  a
piece of igneous rock.

This  spell  is  similar to the 2nd-level continual light spell  in  that  it
creates a very bright light (almost as bright as full daylight). However, any
creature  within  the area of light which is vulnerable  to  silver  (wights,
wraiths,  lycanthropes, or devils, for example) will  suffer  1d6  points  of
damage every round that it remains in the area of effect, and will be  at  -2
to  on  to-hit rolls and +2 to be hit due to the intense discomfort  felt  by
such  creatures while within the Silverlight. Alternatively, the  wizard  may
throw the spell directly at a single target. Such a creature must save versus
spell  or  be blinded for the duration of the spell. If the saving  throw  is
made, the spell forms as per usual about one foot behind the intended target,
and  its  duration  is halved. A creature vulnerable to silver  who  is  thus
targeted need not save versus blinding, but will instead suffer 1d6+1  points
of  damage per level of the wizard, up to a maximum of 10d6+10, and  will  be
stunned  for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw versus spell  at  -2  will
halve  the  damage and reduce the duration of the stun to a single round.  If
thrown  thus  at  a creature vulnerable to silver, the spell  will  not  form
normally,  regardless of the saving throw, as its magic is  used  up  in  the
attack on the creature. The material component is a bit of pure silver.

      The  wizard  extends  his arms and speaks the spell,  and  a  sheet  of
sizzling  purple  sparks shoots forth from the wizard's hands.  These  sparks
cause 1d4 points of electrical damage per three levels of the wizard, rounded
up,  to  a  maximum  of 5d4. Those wielding metal weapons (swords,  etc.)  or
wearing partially metal armour (ring, scale, chain) save at -2 and suffer  +1
point  of  damage  per die. Those wearing full metal armour (splint,  banded,
plate, etc.) save at -4 and suffer double damage. The material component is a
bit of fur, glass, and copper.

     This spell draws upon the power of the positive material plane and calls
forth  a ray of golden light. Anyone in the area of effect of the spell  must
save  versus  petrification or be blinded for 1 round. The true  function  of
this  spell,  however,  is its use against undead,  creatures  of  the  lower
planes, and those drawing power from the negative material plane or the plane
of shadow. Such creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage, plus an additional 1d4
at every even level of the wizard (eg., 4d4 at eighth level), up to a maximum
of  8d4.  These  creatures may save versus spell to halve  this  damage.  The
material component is a bit of crushed sunstone.

This  spell brings into being a quasi-real beast appearing as a war dog  with
black  fur, grey ruff and tail, milky grey eyes, and insubstantial paws which
make  no  sound. The creature will have average (8-10) Intelligence  and  can
converse  with  the  wizard in the common tongue.  The  creature  can  fight,
attacking as a 2+2 HD monster and inflicting 2d4 points of damage per hit. It
can,  however,  affect creatures struck only by magical  weapons.  The  beast
itself  is  AC  0,  and  can  take up to half the wizard's  full  hit  points
(rounding up) before being dispelled.
The  spectral hound can track any creature known to the wizard, provided  the
wizard concentrates on a mental picture of the figure for 2 full rounds.  The
hound  can follow the trail of such a creature with 100% certainty,  -5%  per
hour  the  trail is old. The hound also has infravision to 90 feet, can  spot
hidden (such as in shadows) things 80% of the time, invisible objects 65%  of
the  time, and astral, ethereal, or out-of-phase things 50% of the time.  The
hound  normally moves at 12, though it can run at 24 for 3 rounds each  hour.
Further,  the  hound may cross muddy or swampy ground, or even water,  as  if
were solid, dry ground. The hound leaves no tracks.
By  concentrating for one full round, the wizard can make use of the  hound's
sensory  abilities  for  as  long as desired,  though  this  does  not  allow
communication beyond normal vocal range.
The  hound is unaffected by any spells which alter its form (flesh to  stone,
polymorph,  etc.)  or  restrict or affect its  movement  (haste,  slow,  hold
monster,  etc.).  If a mind control spell is cast upon the  creature  and  it
fails  its  saving throw (saving throws of the hound are as for the  wizard),
then  it  wills itself out of existence. It is further immune to  poison  and
death magics. The hound will speak only to the wizard, and, if the wizard  is
killed, feebleminded, charmed, or otherwise mentally incapacitated, then  the
hound will immediately cease to exist.

The  material  components of this spell are three canine statuettes;  one  of
ivory  or  alabaster,  one  of silver or platinum,  and  one  of  jet,  onyx,
obsidian, or ebony. These statuettes must be worth at least 200 gp each, and,
in  the  course  of the spell, the three merge to become the spectral  hound.
When the spell ends, the hound simply fades slowly out of existence.

      This  spell  causes a blazing white sheet of light to  issue  from  the
wizard's  eyes. This sheet will envelop a number of creatures  based  on  the
wizard's  level. Those who fail a saving throw versus petrification  will  be
blinded  for  a  full turn. Those who do save are merely dazzled  (-2  to-hit
bonus  and +2 to Armour Class) for 1 round, having looked away just in  time.
Dark  dependent creatures such as drow and grey dwarves save at -4,  and  the
duration of its effects are doubled.

This  spell  can  only  be cast outdoors under a night sky  where  stars  are
visible.  The  spell requires 2 turns to cast for each level  of  spells  the
wizard is able to cast (eg., a 12th-level wizard can cast 6 levels of spells,
and  so  would require 12 turns). Upon completion of the spell, the  wizard's
mind  and  body are refreshed and restored as though the wizard had rested  a
full  day. 1d3 HP, plus the wizard's Constitution bonus, if any, are restored
if the wizard is at less than full health. The power of the spell also allows
the  wizard  to  memorise spells in half the usual time, save  for  1st-level
spells,  which may be memorised in a single round. During the lengthy casting
of  this  spell, the wizard is suffused with a pale white glow, and is  fully
aware of things going on nearby. If the spell is interrupted, either by being
struck  by an attack or voluntarily by the wizard, then the effect is  wasted
and  the wizard must sleep for spells as usual. The material component  is  a
diamond worth at least 1000 gp.

      This spell creates one magical star-shaped bladed weapon for each three
levels  of  the wizard, up to a maximum of seven. The wizard may  then  throw
these  as  weapons,  out to the spell's maximum range. They  are  treated  as
slashing  weapons  with  respect  to effectiveness  versus  armour,  and  the
wizard's to-hit rolls with them are at +3, in addition to any bonus for  high
Dexterity. Each starblade that strikes causes 2d4 points of damage, +2 versus
creatures  with  powers drawing on the negative material plane  or  plane  of
shadow. The material component is a small silver star.

This  spell creates a column of brilliant, blazing silvery-white flames.  All
within  10 feet of the column not looking away must save versus petrification
or  be  blinded  for 1 round and dazzled (-2 to-hit, +2 to  be  hit)  for  an
additional  1d3 rounds. Creatures adversely affected by bright  light  (drow,
duergar, etc.) save at -3 versus this effect. Any creature within the  narrow
column  of fire (most likely only a single creature) is automatically blinded
and dazzled as above, and additionally suffers 1d6 points of damage per level
of  the  wizard,  up to a maximum of 10d6. A saving throw versus  spell  will
halve  this damage. If the spell is cast outdoors under a night sky, a  bonus
of +1 per die of damage is added. The material component for this spell is  a
bit of silver and a shard of crystal.

This  spell can only be cast in an area under star- or moonlight. When  cast,
it  brings  into  being a deep blue-black tower of magical metal,  with  many
faint  silvery  gleams.  This  tower is in all respects  similar  to  Daern's
instant fortress (q.v.) except that it grows slowly during the course of  the
casting,  and  so no creature able to move could possibly be  harmed  by  its
expansion.  The  door to the citadel is wizard locked at the wizard's  level.
One creature for each level of experience of the wizard may be designated  in
the casting of the spell, and such creatures may freely open the door, though
the  wizard may override this at any time by mental command. The magic of the
walls of the citadel prevents the passage of any ethereal, astral, or out-of-
phase  creature.  Teleportation into and out of the tower is still  possible.
This  spell  lasts until the first rays of direct sunlight strike the  tower,
but  it  cannot last longer than 2 hours + 1 hour per level of the wizard  in
any  event.  The  material component is a star sapphire  and  a  small  steel
carving of a tower.

      This  spell illuminates an area as a cloudless outdoor night sky filled

out to 80 yards. Intervening cover will, of course, reduce sighting distances
accordingly.  This light does not interfere with infravision, and  there  are
ample shadows within the area of effect to hide in. The illusionary component
of  the spell creates the appearance of an actual starry night sky. The  area
of  effect  is stationary. The material component is a piece of black  velvet
and a few bits of glass.

When this spell is cast, the wizard's body is sheathed in a nearly skin-tight
magical  screen. This screen has the appearance of a black night  sky  filled
with  stars.  Whenever  a light-related spell of any  sort  is  cast  at  the
creature  using  the  starshield, the spell will be harmlessly  absorbed  and
redirected  back  at the caster of the spell. This includes  such  spells  as
light (if cast so as to blind), colour spray, sunray, and prismatic spray. An
area  effect spell where the wizard is the sole target will automatically  be
reflected  in  this way. Area effect light spells in which  others  are  also
targeted  have a chance of being intercepted and redirected by the wizard  as
above  equal  to the wizard's chance to negate the spell with a dispel  magic
spell.
The protected wizard will be unaffected by the spell in any event, and if the
spell  is successfully absorbed, those behind the wizard who would have  been
in  the  area  of  effect are spared the effects of the spell.  By  making  a
successful  check  as  if to dispel magic, the wizard  may  attempt  to  pass
through  a  prismatic  sphere  or  a prismatic  wall.  Darkness  spells  (eg.
darkness,  15-foot  radius,  Nystul's blackmote, or  the  priest's  continual
darkness)  will also be reflected, just as light spells are, and  the  wizard
may  attempt a saving throw versus death magic each round to attempt  to  see
through  any area of magical darkness within normal vision range. If outdoors
under the night sky, the wizard can see as if in broad daylight, even through
magical  areas  of  darkness;  and he will also  absorbs  stellar  radiation,
regenerating  1  HP  per  round that the spell is  in  effect.  The  material
component  for  this spell is a black sapphire and a star sapphire,  both  of
which must be worth not less than 1000 gp.

      This  spell brings into being a wall of blackness which cannot be  seen
through, even with infravision or ultravision. It is dispelled instantly by a
light or continual light (q.v.) spell. It has no physical existence, and does
not  hinder  nor harm those passing through it. It does, however,  block  the
passage of sound from one side to the other, assuming that the spell  is  not
cast  in such a way (such as in a field of grass) which would otherwise allow
sound  to move around the edges of the wall. The material component  is  some
pitch and soot, or a lump of coal.

This  spell  creates  a pearly-white globe of light equivalent  to  continual
light  (q.v.).  Within the area of effect, all shadow and darkness  (even  of
magical  origin)  is  dispelled, and all hidden  or  invisible  creatures  or
objects  are  outlined in a pale blue radiance which lasts  as  long  as  the
wizard light itself, even if the object or creature so outlined moves out  of
the  area  of  effect.  Further, all glyphs of warding,  symbols,  and  other
magical  writings and wards are revealed, glowing a luminous  blue,  and  the
area of effect of such wards is similarly outlined.
This  spell does not reveal astral, ethereal, or out-of-phase creatures,  nor
does  it  reveal purely mechanical traps and secret doors, although traps  or
secret doors disguised by or utilismagic will be revealed. A wizard using duo-
dimension  (q.v.) would appear as a thin line of blue radiance  in  mid  air.
This  spell does not reveal what an illusion is hiding nor the appearance  of
an  invisible  creature  (except for its outline),  but  merely  reveals  its
presence  and location. Hence, a cloak of displacement is useless within  the
wizard  light. The light does not set off magical guards, but it does  reveal
the   form  of  glyphs  and  such  things  for  possible  identification  and
deactivation.  The material component for this spell is a  diamond  worth  at
least 500 gp.

fantastic  animal with an Intelligence of 5 or less. Upon completion  of  the
spell  the caster must make a system shock roll. Success indicates  that  the
recipient creature's Intelligence is increased to 1d4+5 HP. Sentience, if not
previously possessed, is granted, as is a basic understanding of one language
known  by  the  caster. Failing the system shock roll kills  the  animal  and
causes the caster to lose 1 point of Intelligence for 1 year.
This  spell  does not usually grant the recipient the power of speech,  since
few  animals'  vocal  chords  are capable of producing  humanoid  sounds.  DM
discretion should be used here; if the animal is one that would seem to  have
the ability to use human speech (eg., a Myna Bird), then the DM can rule that
the animal is also capable of conversation.
Casting  time  is  2d6+4  weeks, which includes  constant  companionship  and
training.  Successful use of the animal training non-weapon proficiency  will
half the casting time. Only one animal at a time can be affected by the druid
or priest.
The  animal must be regularly touched during the training period. This  could
initially  be quite dangerous as the spell does not magically affect  loyalty
or friendship. One may assume, however, that, depending upon the treatment of
the  animal, the awakened intelligence will lead to a bond between caster and
animal.
Only  a  limited  wish  or  wish will reverse the spell's  effects.  Awakened
intelligence is not be passed on to offspring. The material components are  a
dried fish and a piece of brain coral.

This  spell  is a weaker version of the 7th-level wizard spell limited  wish.
Alter  occurrence enables the wizard to alter the way an event  in  the  very
recent  past  actually  occurred. For the casting of the  spell,  the  wizard
recounts  an event which occurred up to two rounds previous which  he  viewed
firsthand. The wizard, while recounting the incident, modifies it in the  way
which  he  would have liked for it to occur. At the end of the  casting,  the
past  will  be  rewoven along the lines of the wizard's version,  by  a  base
guideline of 3% per level of the wizard.
For  instance, Johann, a 12th-level wizard, uses the spell to  make  a  freak
gust  of wind blow an arrow totally off course which shot his companion Rykor
in  the heart a few seconds ago - a critical hit. Johann has a 36% chance  to
make  the arrow miss, else it still hits doing regular damage. If Johann  had
asked  for  the arrow to have missed Rykor's heart, it might have  still  hit
Rykor but would have done only 100-36 = 64% of the designated damage.
This  spell will automatically modify the perceptions of the past for all  of
those,  other than the wizard, who were present during both the modified  and
unmodified  events  unless  they  make a saving  throw  versus  spell.  Alter
occurrence cannot be used to raise character abilities (even temporarily)  or
mimic  other magical effects. Frequent use of this spell may cause the wizard
to  go  insane; make an Intelligence check with a cumulative -1 penalty  each
time the spell is used by the same wizard over a one week period, or suffer a
random type of insanity.
Alter  occurrence  is a spell published by the wizard Saridan  Hysakai  after
over a decade of study, an unknown amount of which was spent at the plane  of
time. Saridan subsequently went insane.

Through  this  spell, a time spirit may choose one event up to  5  years  per
level  into the past and change it in any way he sees fit. This then  changes
his timeline, and possibly the timeline of those he has dealt with up to that
point  (if  the caster chooses never to have met Karp the Slayer,  then  that
part  of Karp's timeline is altered, too). Whether this spell lets the caster
alter  his  native  time  stream,  or merely  shifted  himself  into  another
timestream  (as per displace self) that matches the situation he was  looking
for,  is something time spirit philosophers get into heated arguments  about.
Regardless,  the  use  of  this  spell has a 60%  chance  of  attracting  the
attention of time guardians.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for

This spell creates a time divergence ranging a number of rounds equal to   of
the caster's level into the past. If this spell is used for a trivial purpose
(such  as letting a gambling time spirit bet on the winning horse instead  of
the  one  that lost), there is a 65% chance Tidligsent will notice and  strip
the  priest of spells. Additionally, there is an 80% chance that use of  this
spell  will  attract  the  attention of time guardians.  DMs  should  make  a
separate check for each eventuality.

      This  spell allows the wizard to give an alcoholic flavour  (taste  and
smell) to any liquid. It does not turn the liquid to alcohol. It merely gives
it  the taste of beer, ale, wine, mead, or liquor. Also, it only changes  the
flavour and not its appearance.

      Now,  a  wizard can buy a glass of water (cheap), cast this spell,  and
enjoy  an  alcohol flavoured drink without suffering the negative effects  of
swigging the real thing. A wizard could also improve the flavour of a  drink.
For  example,  cheap beer can now taste like elegant wine,  but  the  alcohol
level is that of beer. A normally bad tasting potion will taste quite nice as
well.

      The  flavour (cider, ale, wine, etc.) is chosen by the caster. However,
there  is always a 100% - 10% per level chance of the spell screwing  up.  In
this  case, the DM chooses the taste. Note that, since the component is  only
somatic, the spell can be cast unnoticed easily.

     The reverse of this spell, disguise alcohol, allows the caster to remove
the alcoholic flavour of a drink, but without removing the alcohol itself. It
can also be used to restore its normal taste to a previously altered drink.

      This spell is in many ways similar to the 1st-level light spell (q.v.).
With  an  ambient  light, while there is a centre for its sphere  of  effect,
there  is  no point of light at this centre - the intensity of the  light  is
consistent  throughout the entire globe. The light is even behind objects  or
walls,  in  a  closed  chest, in fact, everywhere  in  the  area  of  effect.
Therefore, absolutely no shadows exist. The spell has a number of interesting
effects  because of this; for example, if cast in a hallway, the light  would
extend  through  a  door or wall into an adjacent room (or even  into  secret
tunnels  below the hall) up to the full area of effect. Just beyond  the  20-
yard radius globe, reflected light from the actual area of effect lights up 5
feet  further. This is much dimmer than the globe, is very shadowy (if  there
is something to cast one), and fades off into complete darkness (assuming, of
course, the area would be dark without this spell). One obvious advantage  of
the  spell is to make hiding in shadows impossible within the area of effect.
The material component of this spell is a live firefly.

This spell is similar to the effect of a treant causing trees to walk and  do
his  bidding.  With this spell the priest can affect up to  one  tree  per  3
levels  that is in range. Affected trees change into a treant with total  Hit
Dice  no more than three times the caster's level. Their power is equal to  a
treant  of the same Hit Dice with the exception of those trees with more  Hit
Dice  than  the  largest treant. In that case take the  damage  done  by  the
largest  treant and multiply it with the percentage the tree is  larger  than
the  largest treant. The trees stay in the changed state for a maximum  of  1
round per level of the caster. If they are "killed" before the duration  runs
out  they topple (beware the falling wood) over and stay that way even  after
the  duration runs out. Otherwise they return to their rooting spot and  turn
into normal trees again.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a tiny bit  of
bark from a treant.

      By  means of this spell a wizard can cause the target creature to  lose
the majority of its blood, putting on the borderline of having bled to death.
The creature immediately begins to feel incredibly cold and, if warm-blooded,
lose  three points of Dexterity due to shivering and general lack of  energy.
If  cold-blooded, it will go catatonic as its body temperature sinks to  room
temperature  (60 F or 16 C or less); the time this takes should be  logically
assigned  by  the  DM  given the prevailing conditions  (windy,  underground,
etc.).

      In  addition,  the long term effects are that the target creature  will
suffer  the loss of one point of Strength and Constitution for up to  a  full
week  after  recovery (any Strength 18 score will drop to 17). Recovery  will
begin with the commencement of eating high iron, high protein foods. Recovery
itself  will  take at least a week. Thus the effects of the blood  loss  will
hang on for at least two weeks.

      Other  immediate effects will be that all piercing and slashing  damage
taken  will  be at 1« times the value, this being due to the fact that  these
attacks cause the victim to lose more of what they don't have, blood.

      There  is  a  minor difference between the necromantic  and  transmuter
versions  of this spell. Transmuters require a vampire tooth that  they  must
touch to the spell's target. This tooth will only work for as many tries (not
necessarily  successful castings or attacks) as the level of the wizard  when
he acquired the tooth. Necromancers do not need a material component for this
spell. Only necromancer specialists can learn the necromancer version.

      This  spell requires the caster to sip a drink of any sort.  The  spell
will then analyze all the components of the drink and make them known to  the
caster.

      The  various liquids which make up the drink are revealed specifically,
as  welas  the  proportions  in  which they  are  existant.  Specific  brews,
vintages,  or brands (if applicable) are known exactly, and any  dilution  of
the drink with water is also revealed.

      Since the casting requires actually tasting the drink, it is not really
useful in safely identifying poisons (although the caster will instantly know
the kind of poison that just hit him!).

Using this spell, the elemental priest can analyze some non-magical amount of
his own element and learn its components.
           Air  priests can learn the ingredients of gases and other  similar
material within range.
           Earth  priests can analyze an amount of any mineral,  metal,  gem,
etc.
          Fire priests have somewhat limited options. They can only inspect a
fire  or  smoke  and learn about the source of it (what kind of  material  is
burning) or learn about the temperature of a place.
          Water priests can learn the ingredients of any liquid solution.
If the caster is of twelfth level or higher he can also examine magical items
or  materials (or magical fire in case of the fire priest). In all cases, the
caster can later try to construct the material examined, if he has the proper
ingredients.
The substance to be affected must be in a single body (one flask of liquid or
one  solid mixture). The material component of the spell is a gold coin. This
spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary units  are
for Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

This spell allows the priest to call all animals within the spell effect. The
animals  will converge upon the priest within 1d3 rounds. While the spell  is
in  effect,  none  of the animals will attack each other.  While  there,  the
priest may set one small task for the group to perform. When the spell  ends,
the animals will peacefully disperse to whence they came.

victim won't do anything to hurt the victim, they'll just treat him like  you

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level wizard spell haste with the following
changes:
           it  only  affects  animals (even animals that are  polymorphed  or
shapechanged wizards or priests; they lose this speed once they  change  into
another form which is not an animal),
          it does not cause ageing of the animals,
           it  is  cumulative with one haste of the normal type but not  with
itself.
The  reverse of this spell, slow animal, is similar to the reverse of  haste,
with  the same provisions as above. The material component is the holy symbol
of the priest.

This  spell  simulates the casting of a cure light wounds for a  true  animal
only.  This spell does not work for a shapechanger of any kind, even  if  its
natural shape is an animal and its other shape is something else. This  spell
cures  1d8  hit points of the animal. It even cures critical wounds  such  as
laming  or  a  broken leg. The reverse, animal harm I, requires  a  touch  in
combat  and  deals 1d8 HP of damage. Note: the reverse will almost  never  be
used by a priest with access to the animal sphere   if it is used, there have
to exist some very good reasons   and if it is used without such reasons, the
priest should be prepared to suffer the consequences.
The  spell requires an ointment made from healing plants and the holy  symbol
of  the priest. The reverse requires an ointment made from poison ivy and the
holy symbol of the priest.

By  use  of this spell, the druid is able to merge his body into that  of  an
animal,  forcing the creature to behave according to his will.  The  creature
must  be a normal creature and have fewer Hit Dice than the druid has levels.
The  animal  is allowed a saving throw versus spell (at +4 if the druid  does
not  know the animal, normal otherwise), and if successful, the spell has  no
effect. However, if the druid first assumes the form of the type of animal he
wants to merge with (by using his shape changing ability), no saving throw is
allowed.
Once  the  druid and the animal have merged, the druid can cause the animal's
body to do anything within its ability, regardless of the consequences to the
animal.  However, for every hit point of damage suffered by the  animal,  the
druid suffers half a hit point of damage. In addition, should the animal  die
while  under the control of the druid, a system shock roll must be  made.  If
the roll is failed, the druid dies as well. When the spell ends, the druid is
expelled  from the body of the animal, and re-enters the form he  had  before
entering the animal.
This  spell  functions for druids only. If any other priest wishes  to  merge
into an animal, he must use the 6th-level spell monster merge.

This spell offers a touched creature a single sense of another creature. This
sense  must  be  from any animal. For example, the sense of a bat  will  give
absolute  radar power in any circumstances. The creature can understand  what
it  receives by the new sense if it succeeds at an Intelligence check. If  it
fails,  it  misinterprets the sensory input. Once a number of 20 Intelligence
checks  (with a minimum of one check) have succeeded, the creature no  longer
needs  to make any Intelligence checks again for this sense, unless a special
situation arises: say you had gained the nose of a bloodhound and followed  a
trace through a swamp; suddenly you come upon a large patch of aniseed (which
is  incredible  irritating to dog noses), in this  case  you  would  have  to
succeed  at  an  Intelligence  check  again  (normally  even  with  a   hefty
subtraction).
It  is  possible to have up to one additional sense per 3 Intelligence points
of  the recipient creature; for each new sense the Intelligence checks of all
senses are reduced by 2 (this simulates the strain on the brain of trying  to
cope with so many new sensory inputs).
The material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a tiny bit from
the animal from which you desire to gain the sense.

This  spell  causes  the  priest to leave tracks and  scents  as  the  animal
specified during casting. The tracks have traces of magic for 3 turns,  after
which  they  are  indistinguishable  from normal  tracks.  Only  non-mythical
creatures can be impersonated. A holly berry and some fur from the animal  to
be impersonated are needed to cast this spell.

      An  illusion of one or more small animals can be brought into being  by
means  of  this  spell. The animals must be of a sort very  familiar  to  the
wizard,  and  each can be no larger than a fox, a rabbit, or a  medium  hawk.
Animals  created  can be of more than one type. The illusion  is  visual  and
auditory,  being much like a specialised form of the 2nd-level  wizard  spell
improved phantasmal force.

By  casting  animate  clothing, the cast can add body  and  substance  to  an
illusion.  The spell animates one or more articles of clothing,  drawing  its
power  from  the vestiges of life energy left by the most recent wearer.  The
clothing fills out to the proportions of the previous owner, around which the
caster can create an illusion, generally of someone wearing the clothing. The
animated  clothing  moves, wrinkles, and stretches as  if  worn,  and  exerts
tension  and mild force. Should someone touch or come into contact  with  the
clothing,  it  will  feel as if someone was actually  wearing  the  clothing.
Attacks or forceful contact adds a +2 to disbelieving the illusion.

The  material component is any article of clothing that has been worn  within
one  week.  Almost  any article of clothing can be animated:  shirts,  pants,
dresses,  hats,  boots,  gloves, etc. One article per  three  levels  can  be
animated  at  once,  clothing that comes in pairs counting  as  one  (gloves,
socks),  and can be mismatched, although mismatched articles filling  out  to
different  proportions  could be suspicious. Even pieces  of  armour  may  be
animated, however due to the heavier mass and lessen flexibility, each counts
as  two  articles of clothing (a complete suit of plate armour is not counted
as  one  item, but a leather jerkin is). Animated clothing can move and  lift
light  objects, turn pages in a book, pick up a small gem, but cannot perform
actions  requiring dexterity, such as unrolling a scroll or picking a pocket.
They  furthermore cannot attack or wield weapons, not even daggers or  darts.
Any  attempt  exhausts the life energy fuelling the spell instantly  and  the
clothing ceases to be animated. Animated clothing remains so as long  as  the
caster concentrates.
The  illusion  of the creature is not a separate spell, but part  of  animate
clothing.  Additionally, an illusion of the creature who most  recently  wore
this clothing is not automatically supplied by the spell.
The clothing used has to have been worn for at least 8 hours for there to  be
enough residual life energy to animate with. Once the spell has been cast  on
the  spell (successfully or not), the clothing cannot be animated again until
it has been worn again for another 8 hours. The clothing remains animated for
as  long  as the caster concentrates, but, like phantasmal force, the  caster
cannot perform other actions.

This  spell  creates a higher form of undead, a ghoul, from the body  of  any
humanoid  smaller than an ogre. The body must be reasonably intact, and  must
have  obtained  at  least fifth level in any class before  death.  The  ghoul
usually obeys the commands of its animator, though it is free willed. If  the
wizard appears weak or vulnerable, the ghoul will turn on him. This is not  a
common  occurrence,  as ghouls tend to be cowards. They will  not  carry  out
suicidal requests.

is  a  long  process and additional spells are required to fully animate  the
golem,  but  this  spell  can  replace the wish spell  in  the  process.  The
component is the golem to be animated and some gorgon blood.

      This  spell allows a wizard to shape a dense mist or fog into any shape
within the confines of the area of effect. The shape can then be animated.

     The details of the shape and the complexity of the animation are poor at
lower wizard levels, but increase with experience. A 1st-level wizard may  be
able to make a humanoid shape of a given size, but couldn't make it look like
a  dwarf. Similarly, he couldn't animate it, but could displace it within the
spell's  range.  By third level, the wizard could animate the  shape  to  the
point  where it would resemble a dwarf (but not a particular dwarf) and could
talk.

The  material component is a bit of dense mist, fog or smoke. The  spell  can
add  more  mist,  but it can't create mist out of nothing. For  example,  the
smoke from a fire or a fog spell would be sufficient.

Mist  mages: when cast by a mist mage, animate mist has the metamagic ability
of  increasing the effect or potency of other spells. If animate mist is cast
prior to spook, the spook can affect more creatures - usually 1 HD more -, or
a -2 penalty on the victim's saving throws can be added.

This  spell  animates one or more skeletons to serve the wizard  as  powerful
warriors.  A  wizard  can animate one skeleton warrior  per  five  levels  of
experience  (round  all fractions down). These skeletons have  the  following
statistics:  MV 12, AC 3, 8 HD, THAC0 13, Number of Attacks 2/1,  Damage  per
attack  1d8 + chill (-1 to-hit, to damage and to saving throws for 1d4 turns,
no  saving throw, multiple hits are cumulative), they have a magic resistance
of 10%, they receive only half damage from slashing or piercing weapons, holy
water  inflicts  3d4 damage on them, they are immune to sleep,  charm,  fear,
hold,  and paralysis; they receive only half damage from cold and fire;  they
regenerate 1 hit point per round (even if "killed": only fire and acid damage
is  permanent), their gaze causes paralysis (saving throw to avoid;  duration
2d4  rounds;  this ability can be used every three rounds,  starting  on  the
third round of combat).

The  material  components of this spell are human (only) skeletons  that  are
reasonably  intact  and  a drop of blood from the wizard.  When  the  spell's
duration  ends, the skeletons crumble into dust. Only evil wizards  use  this
spell frequently; others may suffer alignment changes.

This  spell allows the priest to bend wood to his will, making it supple  and
flowing, altering the shape of the wood permanently (though the form  created
must bear some semblance to the original form of the wood). A living tree may
be  animated at five feet (height) per level. Dead wood may be animated at  a
rate  of two arrow shafts per level. The wood may be made to grasp, entangle,
or attack as club. The material component of this spell is a supple twig.

This  spell causes a spherical region, 1 metre in radius, to appear  anywhere
within  range  of  the wizard. In this region all matter  vanishes.  When  it
appears, a hurricane-force wind blows into the sphere as the air inside it is
annihilated. All human-sized or smaller creatures in the vicinity who have no
means  of  support must make a saving throw versus death magic or lose  their
balance and be sucked into the sphere and destroyed (in which case a wish  or
possibly a limited wish is required to recover them). "Means of support"  can
include,  for  example, holding onto something solid being  held  by  another
character,  being  under the influence of a fly spell or having  the  natural
ability to fly or levitate (eg. a beholder).
Note  that  the  wizard is not necessarily immune to being  sucked  into  the
sphere.  Light  objects which are not being held by anything or  anyone  (eg.
papers  lying  on a desk) are also liable to be sucked into  the  sphere  and
destroyed. Anything thrown into the sphere, short of an artifact or relic, is
automatically  destroyed.  While the sphere can move  under  control  of  the
wizard,  it  is  not a useful weapon because it moves only at  walking  pace,
hence even the clumsiest creature can easily dodge it. If an attempt is  made
to  actually cast the spell at a target, a saving throw inwhether the  target
dodges  or  is hit and destroyed. A successful dispel magic will destroy  the
sphere,  otherwise it neither affects nor is affected by spells. The material
component for this spell is a 1000 gp ruby.

      This  is a more powerful version of the 1st-level spell minor annoyance
(q.v.),  in  that  it  creates the illusion of a bumblebee  flying  into  the
victim's  ear.  The  victim only gets one saving throw;  if  successful,  the
annoyance  lasts  for  only  one  round. The spell's  effects  start  at  the
beginning of the next round, just like minor annoyance.

The  material  component of this spell is a dead insect. If  an  actual  dead
bumblebee is used, the victim's saving throw is made at -2.

This  spell animates one small object of no more than 3 cubic feet  in  size.
The object then takes on a pseudo-life, with a degree of intelligence and the
ability  to  speak and move. If the original object was not  flexible,  extra
flexibility or small limb-like structures form  upon it to allow it movement.
Its capabilities aren't strong or powerful enough to allow combat or anything
more potent than an unseen servant can accomplish physically. The object  has
a  personality  appropriate  to  its  original  nature,  but  never  a  truly
malevolent one (unless the object is a torture device or such). In any  case,
the  object's pseudo-intelligence is never more than 8, but it is capable  of
carrying  on  reasonable and witty (dependent upon personality)  conversation
despite  its  inability  to truly learn new fields of knowledge.  The  object
remains  animate unless a successful dispel magic is applied,  but  the  same
personality  can  be  re-evoked (along with what pass  for  memories  in  the
object) with a recasting of anthropomorphization. When determining the nature
of an object's personality, think of fantasy and science fiction sources such
as  The Brave Little Toaster (the story) or Beauty and the Beast (the movie).
An  intelligent  being that has somehow been polymorphed into  an  object  or
whose  soul is trapped in an object can be spoken to and made "active"  using
this  spell, although they are bound to want to become truly free once  more.
Secluded  or  eccentric  wizards often have houses full  of  charming  little
animated companions, because they really are fun to have around.

The  material component is the skull and paw of a naturally deceased and well
loved pet (not necessarily the caster's own).

      By means of this spell, an invisible shell of magic is created around a
creature or item. The shell is easily detected or dispelled. In fact,  it  is
there  to be dispelled. If an item entreated with this spell is the recipient
of a dispel magic, passes through a dispel magic zone, passes through an anti
magic   shell,  etc.,  the  anti  "anti  magic"  magic  shell  is   destroyed
immediately. The item inside the shell, in essence, got a free saving  throw.
Any further attempts to dispel the item are treated normally.

      The spell will create one shell per 3 levels of casting ability, and up
to 5 shells may be placed on any one item or creature, but only from the same
casting.  I.e., Melvin the mage, who is 6th-level and has 2 spells  to  cast,
can  place one shell on each of 4 items, or 2 shells on each of 2 items,  but
not 4 shells on one item.

      A shell placed on a magical creature protects that creature but not its
possessions. In the event of an item or creature with multiple shells  caught
inside  an  anti  magic shell, dispel magic zone or similar;  each  shell  is
stripped  off  at  the  very  beginning  of  each   Unwilling  creatures   or
intelligent  items  are allowed a saving throw versus  spell  to  negate  the
shell.  The  material component is a down feather inside as many  small  silk
pouches  as  the  caster can cast shells. A pouch disappears for  each  shell
destroyed.

This  spell  reduces the effect of gravity to absolute zero in  the  area  of
effect  thus causing anything to effectively float with no weight  (note  the
mass  still  exists  (while a vault door weighs nothing it  still  can  crush
someone  who  has  the  unfortunate luck of being between  it  and  its  door
frame)). It can be lain on an area without a focusing object but in that case
it is limited to the area of effect noted above. If a focusing object is used
the  casting time changes to 1 hour per 10 feet per level per side cube.  The
focusing object is not destroyed in the casting but if it is ever moved  from
its  place or even touched by the caster after the enchantment is placed  the
spell fails immediately.
Once the spell is in effect anything within the area of effect of one 10-foot
cube  per level can be moved almost without effort (unless it is very large).
If  the spell is focused on an object then the object is within the centre of
the  cube.  This cube then measures 10 feet per level per side (an 18th-level
wizard creates a 180-foot cube).

The material component (even without the focusing object) is a hollow diamond
which  has  a  perfectly round hollow inside without having any hinges.  This
diamond  must  have  cost a least 10,000 gp before being  hollowed  out.  The
focusing object (if it is used) has to be a completely priceless object which
is  absolutely unique such as the largest gem ever found on the  planet,  the
complete  and untarnisset of platinum teeth of the poorest man ever  to  have
lived  on  the planet or something likewise illogical or (almost)  impossible
(as the DM desires for that special case).

      The  origin of the spell is still unknown, but it is said that  it  was
found  accidentally by a magic student who was killed by a powerful wizard  a
few days later. That wizard is said to have been his teacher. The distinction
of this spell is that only a small number of wizards has heard of or used it.
It is said that it travels from one wizard to another with a spellbook with a
cost of the death of the last wizard carrying it.

      When  the  spell  is cast, a bright grey light occurs on  the  wizard's
finger.  As  the wizard points the target, a grey aura covers the victim  but
gives no harm. The victim is unaware of this, but every round the spell sucks
the  enchantments from every item carried, including swords, armour,  cloaks,
potions, rings, staves, wands or anything else that is magical. Items that do
not  have  bonuses  in the form of plusses or percentages immediately  become
useless,  until the spell ends. The ones having bonuses lose one  point  each
round. For example, Ayala has a broad sword, +4. When he is under the spell's
effect, the sword is +4 in the first round, +3 in the second round, +2 in the
third  round, +1 in the fourth round, and an ordinary broad sword after that,
until the spell's duration expires.

      The enchantments never go negative and negative ones stay the same.  At
the  instant  the spell expires, the bonuses return by one point  per  round.
Items  having an ego are allowed to save versus spell, but they suffer  a  -1
penalty  for every two levels of the caster. Other items are not  allowed  to
save.  Also,  there is a 20% chance that a wizard will fail casting  a  spell
when  surrounded by the aura, even if he is casting dispel magic. By the way,
dispel magic negates the effects. The material component of this spell is  an
ornate fan, worth at least 10 gp.

#9#
This  spell  creates  a  large  black cloud that  drains  magic  from  items,
functioning spells, and even the casting ability of wizards and priests.  The
cloud appears around the spell caster, and will affect him for as long as the
wizard  stays within the cloud. The cloud will move in the direction  of  the
wind  at  half  the wind's velocity. If the wind pushes the cloud  off  of  a
cliff,  the black menace will sink, attempting to hang low to the ground.  If
the cloud is in a location where there is no wind, it will remain in the same
location.
The  cloud immediately drains any functioning spells of ninth level or  less,
automatically.  No spell casting can take place within its influence,  and  a
spell  cast  into  the cloud will disperse upon entering. No properties  from
magical  items may function within the cloud; be it an  arrow, +1 or a  staff
of  the  magi.  Furthermore, the cloud can permanently drain  magical  items.
Magic items are drained as follows:

Base chance of draining  100%
per level of creator     -5%

A  draining  roll is made for each item for each round that it is within  the
cloud.  There is no "partial draining" for any item; either the  item  is  as
magical as before, or it is dead of all magic.
For  example,  a sword, +3 is brought into the cloud and misses its  draining
roll;  it  has become drained of magic and will remain so, even when  brought
from  the cloud. In another example, a sword, +3 that makes its saving  throw
for  a  given  round is still considered to be non-magical  for  that  round.
However, if it were removed from the cloud by the end of the round, it  would
again be a sword, +3.
Artifacts cannot be drained, but they do not function within the cloud.
For  magical  items that may not be completely covered by the cloud  (Daern's
instant  fortress,  for example), a saving throw is still  required  for  the
portion  of the item that is still within the cloud. If a portion of a  large
item  is  drained, it is up to the DM to determine the outcome; for  example,
the  item might function with only a fraction of its original power or  might
completely implode.
The  cloud  affects an activated cube of force as follows: a failed  draining
roll  must be generated for the force field before anything within the cube's
protected field, including the cube itself, can be affected.

The material components for the spell are a star sapphire ono less than 5,000
gp in value, and a sanctified silver holy symbol of the primary god of magic.

This  spell enables the wizard to operate normally in areas where magic would
otherwise  not work. These areas include: magic dead lands, lands within  the
radius of an anti-magic shell, and lands in the cone of the anti-magic ray of
a  beholder.  Each round in one of these areas while under the protection  of
this  spell,  the  wizard  must save versus spell. If  the  saving  throw  is
successful,  the  wizard can cast spells normally that round.  A  new  saving
throw  must  be made each round, and whether successful or not,  the  effects
only  last  for one round. Spells with a duration longer than a single  round
remain  as long as the wizard continues to successfully save. This  spell  is
also efffor spells cast into one of these areas from a normal magic area,  so
long as the wizard saves successfully.

This  spell  causes a moveable shell to spring up in which no  psionics  work
(not  the  caster  psionics (if he has any) nor anybody else's  powers).  The
caster  does  not need to concentrate on the shell to keep it up.  It  has  a
diameter of 1 foot per level of the caster. Anything not completely inside is
not protected: a character that pokes his arm out of the sphere is completely
unprotected.  This  shell  does  not protect against  anything  else.  It  is
possible  to bring down the anti-psionic shell with dispel magic  or  through
psionic  combat  with a power score versus the level of the caster.  In  this
case,  both  characters have to roll: the psionic creature versus  its  power
score  and  the  caster  has to roll versus his level  up  to  a  maximum  of
nineteenth level. The one with the higher successful roll wins. If the caster
wins,  the  shell remains in effect and the psionicist cannot use  his  power
within  the  shell.  If  the psionicist wins, the  shell  collapses  and  all
psionics can be used within the former shell's area.

The  material  component  is a pinch of powdered mind  flayer  and  intellect
devourer brain.

When this spell is cast, the creatures or objects affected immediately assume
the  mass  of  solid  lead. A falling or flying object or  creature  affected
starts to plummet, and damage taken from falling is doubled, i.e., 2d6 per 10
feet  fallen,  to  a maximum of 20d6 from a height of 100  feet.  Anvil  fall
affects  one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long  as  the
maximum  original  weight  of the creatures or  objects  does  not  exceed  a
combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the wizard.
A feather fall cast upon a creature or object under the influence of an anvil
fall  will only negate the latter, and the creature then receives only normal
falling  damage. An additional feather fall would be needed  to  achieve  the
normal  effect of that spell, and two such spells could probably not be  cast
in time by a single wizard.
Like  a  feather  fall, anvil fall works only upon free-falling,  flying,  or
propelled objects, and cannot affect a sword blow or a charging creature.

This spell is similar in effect to the other call spells. With it, the wizard
can  summon up to 1 HD worth of carnivorous apes to fight. The apes will only
fight, they cannot be used for other tasks. Each ape has a Hit Die cost of 5,
and  all  remainders  are dropped. This spell can only be  cast  in  tropical
areas,  and is a favourite of tribal spellcasters and witch doctors in  these
areas.

This  spell is an improvement of the 5th-level area effect non-detection.  It
affects up to one creature per caster level in a 30-foot diameter sphere. The
creatures which are to be affected are chosen by the spell caster as long  as
they  are  within  the  area of effect. The creatures  can  use  their  magic
resistance at half the normal chance to resist the effect of this spell. They
get  no other saving throw (not even their scarab saves). If they fail  their
magic resistance checks, their magic resistances are reduced by 4% per caster
level.  This works even on items which provide magic resistance. This  effect
lasts for 1 turn per level of the caster.

The  material  component is a handful of iron which has been  filed  from  an
active  iron  golem's  head. These iron shavings have to  be  corroded  in  a
solution  made  from a potion of magic resistance (which is spoiled  by  this
use) and one full gallon of water from the Styx which has been touched in the
previous minute by Charon (the boatman of the dead).

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level non-detection, but it affects an area
(see  above). It can be linked to a creature so that the area of effect moves
with the creature. As it is a higher-powered version of non-detection, it can
be  used to protect even from true seeing (in a very limited form: if a  user
of any form of true seeing tries to penetrate this form of non-detection, the
caster of this spell gets a saving throw modified by a -1 for every level  of
the opposing caster above his own, but he does not gain any bonuses if he  is
above  the  opposing caster's level). If this non-detection is  linked  to  a
creature,  it  gains the saving throw instead of the caster. If the  creature
has  a  magic resistance, it can be used at one quarter (round down)  of  its
usual  chance to help protect the linked creature and any others  within  the
sphere from detection of any kind.

The  material component is a complete and previously unopened nutshell, which
has  been completely filled with fool's gold created by the fool's gold spell
(don't  use iron spar). This nutshell has to be coated in a layer of platinum
so  that it gives a perfect sphere with no indication as to what it contains.
This  has  to  cost  no less than 5000 gp. On this sphere, one  non-detection
spell is cast. At this stage it can be used as a material component for  this
spell.

This spell is similar to the 2nd-level withdraw. It affects one creature  per
caster level in the sphere of effect. The restrictions are also the same: the
creature  is not able to move from the space it was when the spell was  cast,
it  cannot cast any non-personal spells (except cure light wounds), it cannot
cast  any  spells on others. If any of the previous are tried,  the  creature
immediately  returns to the normal time frame when it starts  the  prohibited
action.  For all those affected by this spell they will have additional  time
to  think  about a problem, to rest, to cast personal spells, etc.  The  time
that  passes is real for all purposes. In the one-round duration of the spell
one  round  per level of the caster passes for those affected by  the  spell.
Thus,  if it were cast by a 10th-level caster, all those affected would  have
10 minutes = 1 turn to prepare weapons, cast personal spells, etc. within one
minute.  The  caster can choose which creatures are to be  affected  by  this
spell.  If this effect is not desired, the creature may save versus spell  to
resist this spell.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest plus the sand from
an hourglass which has lain still for one year in water.

This  spell  empowers the caster with one spell level per two caster  levels.
With  these  spell  levels the caster may increase or decrease  the  area  of
effect  of  any other spells he casts during the duration of this spell.  The
area  increase  may  achieve a maximum increase of up to twice  the  area  at
caster  levels 12-16, 3 times the area at caster levels 17-21, one time  more
per 5 caster levels above that.
The  size increase does not increase the damage of the spell; to the contrary
-  a  spell decreases in damage to a fraction determined by the factor  given
above: half damage at factor 2, one third damage at factor 3, etc.
Thus, a fireball would increase to a 40-foot radius sphere, but (if cast by a
10th-level or higher caster) would only cause 5 dice of damage to any  within
its  area  of effect. Thus, if a 28th-level wizard cast a cone of cold  at  a
quadruple  size,  he would only cause 7d4+7 points of damage  to  all  within
(which might still be enough in a pinch).

The  material  component of this spell is a hammered-out  sheet  of  gold  no
smaller  than one square foot per factor increase the caster intends  to  use
during the duration. This is not worth so much due to the amount of gold  but
due to the finesse with which it has to be worked; thus, it costs 10,000 gp.
The  reverse  of this spell, area of effect decreaser, reduces  the  area  of
effect  but  increases the damage of the spell by 50% per  reduction  factor.
Thus, if the size of a spell is halved, it can cause up to 150% the number of
dice  of  damage  in half its area (the fireball would shrink  to  a  10-foot
radius  sphere  with a maximum of 15d6 of damage), size  reduction  to    the
damage  (a  fireball with approximately 7-foot radius isn't huge but  it  can
cause 20d6 damage) is increased to 200%, etc.
The  reverse' component is a solid cube of gold which has been compressed  by
dwarven  machines for well over a year until it reaches a density  where  one
cubic inch weighs 20 pounds. For this spell, a cube of 3 inches per side  (27
cubic inches or 54 pounds of gold = 540 gp worth plus the additional cost  of
paying  the dwarves for having to stop their mining machinery (or even worse:
of building a new set of machines for the wizard)). The machinery usage might
cost  somewhere  between 1000 gp (if the dwarves really love the  wizard)  to
somewhere around 50,000 or 100,000 gp (if they just hate him normally) for  a
single cube. All material components are completely destroyed in the casting.
These  spells  can  each be layered up to a maximum of one  spell  level  per
caster  level at once (per casting of the spell). The normal and the reversed
spells  are two different spells and their respective spell levels cannot  be
mixed;  the  caster  has to keep two different quotas: one  for  those  spell
levels with which he may increase area of effects and another quota of  spell
levels with which he may decrease the area of effect. The caster may have  up
to  one  spell  level per caster level for the normal and another  one  spell
level  per  caster level for the reversed effect. If these spells'  durations
run out (or are made to run out by dispel magic) the caster has to succeed at
a  saving  throw  versus  spell at -1 per spell level  of  this  spell  still
contained.  If it fails, the caster inflates or deflates very forcibly  by  a
factor  of  one per spell level. To calculate the damage done to the  caster,
the factor is reciprocated (a six changes to one sixth); this is the fraction
of  hit points the caster would have left over if he had been at maximum  hit
points. This might kill the caster, if he is at less than maximum hit points.
If  the  caster  is reduced by this damage to less than -30  hit  points,  he
explodes or shrinks to nothing due to this spell. Even if the caster survives
the inflation or deflation of the caster may cause serious problems, but this
depends  on  the DM's judgement and it causes some quite gruesome but  rather
spectacular deaths if the caster isn't really careful! Inflation or deflation
lasts  for one round (unless the caster exploded due to inflation) per  spell
level left over, if the caster survives.

This  spell cause sand, earth, loose gravel, topsoil, etc. around the  wizard
to  form  into a hollow dune. The dune is one foot thick and large enough  to
hold 10 people, their gear and sufficient air for them to breathe comfortably
for  the  duration  of  the spell. Note that the spell is  sufficient  for  a
certain number of life forms, so pets and the like take up just as much  room
for  the spell's effect as a hill giant does and if a life form is more  than
10  feet  distant  from the rest of the creatures, it is  excluded  from  the
spell. The dune is hard enough that it may be walked over by any creature  of
Medium size or less, without a chance of it collapsing. Should a creature  of
Large  size  walk  on it, it holds for 1 round + 1 round  per  level  of  the
caster, assuming that creature is not actively attempting to enter the  dome.
Larger  creatures  crush the dome in one round. From the  outside,  the  dune
appears to be part of the natural landscape and unless the person in question
knows  the  terrain intimately, they will not suspect that there is  anything
afoot  with the terrain. The dune cannot be seen through from the inside  and
it requires a hear noise roll to perceive sound through the earth.
Common  uses of this spell are to give the party a convenient place to  sleep
to  avoid encounters or to protect the party from either sand storms  or  the
beating mid-day sun.

The  material  component is a glass dome, half filled with fine  sand  and  a
miniature  silver  replica of a campsite attached to the base.  The  item  is
worth  100  gp and is not destroyed with the casting of the spell. The  sand,
however, must be replaced with each casting, through the corked hole  in  the
base. Upon castingthe spell, the globe is shook, while the words "there's  no
place like home" are said in Svirfneblin.

This spell armours the recipient creature in a magical aura. The armour bonus
is 4 plus one point of Armour Class per level. Thus, a 7th-level caster would
get  an  Armour  Class of 2, while an 11th-level caster would get  an  Armour
Class  of  0.  If actual armour is worn, the better of the two  (real  armour
versus  the  armour  spell) is used. This spell works with  rings  and  other
magical  protections plus the creature's Dexterity bonus if any. The material
component of this spell is a left glove.

horniness  is  not  directed towards anyone or anything  in  particular.  The

surfaces  were  ever  before adjacent, the spell so  indicates,  and  if  the
surfaces  were  ever directly connected as a single item,  an  even  stronger

This creates a wall (which can have any shape the wizard desires, including a
sphere)  which  prevents  physical effects which would  pass  through  normal
walls, such as teleport, astral projection, monkish "phase" ability, etc. Any
such attempt by a character will fail, leaving the character on the same side
of  the wall. It is, however, possible to simply walk through an astral wall.
If the spell is linked to an existing physical wall (including one created by
wall of stone or wall of iron), the duration becomes one hour per level.  The
astral wall can be disrupted by dispel magic cast from either the physical or
astral plane. The material component is a piece of parchment.

This  spell can summon a class II type of intelligent mist from the elemental
plane  of  air.  The  creature is summoned when an event triggers  the  spell
(similar  to  magic mouth). The spell attacks first person  encountered.  The
mist  will stop an attack after it has been summoned upon conditions  set  by
the wizard.
The  mist is actually a being from the elemental plane of air (albeit  a  low
powered  one).  The difference between intelligent mists and  other  summoned
creatures  is that the mists actually have access to the knowledge  of  their
summoner.  This  includes 1 language (chosen by the wizard)  and  information
(not spells) dictated by the casting wizard.
For  a detailed description of the different types of intelligent mists,  see
the   monster  description  provided  with  the  5th-level  magic  mist.  The
instructions for the attacking mist must be written on a piece of paper  (the
material component of this spell), which must be burnt in the casting.
Whether  the mist stops attacking or wins the battle, it will not  return  to
its own plane until either dispelled or the spell duration expires.
For  example, Raji casts an attacking mist spell. He states that a mist  will
be summoned when anyone comes into this room, and will cease to attack anyone
who speaks his name.

      This  spell was originally created for the "lawmaker" class. It  allows
the  caster to see an aura about his subject. By observing this aura  he  can
tell  how  far  along  the lines of lawfulness or chaos  the  person  is.  In
general, a lawful character will have a steady, bright, close-to-white  aura,
while a chaotic character would have a shimmering, dim, dark aura. This spell
is  mainly used in the ceremony of change, when a lawmaker must be judged  on
his  past deeds. This spell helps eliminate people who are not fit to  be  in
the  lawmaker  class.  This spell can be cast on any humanoid,  not  only  on
lawmakers.

When this spell is cast, it surrounds the druid with an overwhelming aura  of
life.  This aura is comforting to woodland creatures (+25% on reaction rolls)
for  it  is  the  sensation of life which puts the animals at ease  with  the
druid.
This, however, is not the principal purpose for the spell. Its primary use is
to  turn  undead.  Undead creatures find this sensation  emanating  from  the
druid's aura very distasteful. When undead encounter this sensation, they are
usually  repulsed. This occurs if the druid succeeds in turning undead  as  a
priest  does. If the die roll to "turn undead" does not succeed,  the  undead
are not repulsed.
The  druid's level is the level used to determine the effect of the  turning.
This  is  only  the  case  if the druid is in natural surroundings  (such  as
forest,  underground caverns and caves, or plains etc.). If the druid  is  in
his own consecrated grove, then he gets a +4 modifier to the die roll to turn
undead and in addition is allowed to turn twice the normal number of undead.
If  the druid is in an unnatural surrounding (such as buildings or the astral
and ethereal planes of existence) then he turns undead as a priest two levels
lower  than  his current level. This is because the influence  of  nature  is
reduced in these surroundings (note: in some man-made surroundings there  may
not  be  a  reduction  because of the circumstances   a man-made  garden  for
example).  The  material component of this spell is a  freshly  cut  twig  of
mistletoe.

This  spell creates a 20-foot radius of fear around the caster. Any  creature
who  enters this area must save versus spell or flee in blind terror for  2d4
rounds.  Creatures  affected have a 75% - 5% per level (minimum  25%)  chance
that  they will drop whatever they are carrying. Any creature prevented  from
fleeing will fight as a berserker whomever is restraining them. A new  saving
throw is required each round spent in the aura.

Casting  of this spell creates up to five glowing, circular plates  of  force
which hang in the air in a 3-foot radius around the wizard. These plates move
to deflect magical energies aimed at the wizard of which the latter is aware.
The plates are effective against magical rays, beams, bolts and missiles from
both spells and magic items. The target of these offensive spells has only  a
cumulative  15%  chance  per plate to be protected against  totally  accurate
spells (such as magic missile), but a 19% chance per plate of avoiding  magic
requiring a to-hit roll (such as lightning bolt).
Upon  impact  with  the  plates, the offensive magic  is  deflected  at  full
strength  in a random direction away from the target (roll 1d4 for height:  1
or  2:  same  height,  3  or 4: up; roll 1d6 for direction  relative  to  the
defender: 1: left, 2: left and front, 3: up in front or back at rival wizard,
4:  right  and  front, 5: right, 6: either straight up  or  is  absorbed  and
destroys  a plate). The plates can be brought down by disintegrate or  dispel
magic, impact with a rod of cancellation or shatter (destroys one plate),  or
a limited wish or wish. The plates do not protect against non-magical attacks
or magical attacks of a type not listed above.
At  the end of the spell's duration, the plates disappear two per round until
all  are gone. The material components for this spell are tiny disks cut from
50  gp  gems, one for each plate to be invoked; the disks are used up in  the
casting.
Auralon's  deflective plates is a spell Auralon devised  in  his  spare  time
while  serving  under the Mageoclave, and before becoming a  member  of  that
group.

      With  this spell a wizard can determine the cause of death of a corpse.
No  language  restrictions  apply,  this is  not  a  communication  with  the
deceased.  At  higher levels, the spellcaster can learn more of the  target's
actions immediately prior to death.

up to 5     1 week      1/10 round

8-10        1 year      1 turn

14-17       1000 years  1 hour
18+         any age     1 hour

      The  maximum time frame allowable is the amount of time that the caster
may  learn about from the corpse. One question every two levels, starting  at
the  2nd,  is  allowable (none at 1st, one at 2-3, two  at  4-5,  etc.).  The
questions  must  be  answered  analytically, locations,  actions  of  others;
questions  about intent, feelings of participants, etc. are not  allowed.  To
facilitate this, the DM should answer as tersely as possible.

The  material component is the corpse (or fragment thereof). The wizard  must
touch  the  corpse for the duration of the spell and concentrate deeply.  Any
interruption will waste the spell and spell charge.

The  use  of  this  spell brings forth very potent energies to  the  priest's
disposal. The spell actually causes part of the priest's deity to inhabit the
priest.  The  priest will then become an avatar of the god with  one  of  the
god's aspects.
The  avatar  will have the powers of a demi-power and will have the  priest's
choice  of one of the classes the deity has experience in (one of the deity's
aspects).  In  addition  to these powers, the priest still  retains  his  own
powers  and abilities. If the class chosen is the same as one of the  classes
that the priest has, then he will have the higher of the two levels.
The  priest  will retain the power until the situation no longer requires  it
(plus  a couple of rounds for mopping up), or until the avatar is killed.  If
the  avatar  is  killed, the deity loses the abilities of the class  for  one
tenth  of the time that the god would normally be "dead" as if slain  on  his
home plane.
In  order  to  receive this spell at all, the priest must  exemplary  in  his
faith. The spell, if used, would require special sacrificing afterwards (this
is  the  material component for the spell). Exactly when and how much depends
on the god.
If  the  spell is used to confront another avatar or deity, then rather  than
having  a  confrontation, the deity may decide to do something else  instead,
such  as  any  form of indirect help. If the deities involved are traditional
enemies...
If  the  privilege  of  having this spell is misused in  any  way,  then  the
offending  priest will be severely punished, maybe losing the opportunity  to
cast  this  spell  forever,  or in a more serious transgression,  losing  all
priest abilities forever.
The  deity is not enslaved by this spell and thus does not have to answer the
spell's  partial  summons. If the need is there, then more than  likely,  the
spell will be answered.

This  spell  is basically similar to dog call. The wizard summons  1  HD  per
level of avians. The creatures summoned can only be used in combat. Only  one
type  of  creature can be summoned per casting of this spell: all  remainders
are lost. None of these creatures can be used as a mount, not even in combat.

     Wizard's Level Summoned Avians
     9-11 blood hawk (1 HD), hippogriff (4 HD)
     12-14     giant owl, giant eagle
     15-17     griffon
     18+  wyvern (9 HD), dragonne (9 HD)

The  wizard  may  always  choose to summon avians from  a  lower  level.  The
material component of this spell is a feather.

This spell allows the priest to command any avian within range as long as the
avian  can  hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal  avians  can  be
affected, including variants in size. Thus eagles, sparrows, doves, etc., can
be commanded but pegasi and phoenixes cannot. The command must be given in  a
short  sentence of at most 25 words. The avian will automatically  understand
the language the priest is speaking. Since familiars are not considered to be
normal  animals,  they  cannot  be commanded  by  this  spell.  The  material
component of this spell is a feather.

When  this  spell is cast, the priest invokes the blessings of his deity  and
claps  his  hands  sharply once. The sound of the clap allows  all  creatures
within  the  area  of effect who hears it to awaken. Sleeping  (naturally  or
magically induced) creatures will wake up. Those under the influence of  mind
affecting  drugs  or other substances will become coherent for  1  round  per
level  of  the priest. Creatures whose minds are under some sort  of  foreign
influence  (charmed,  hypnotised,  dominated,  enthralled,  etc.,   but   not
possessed)  get a second saving throw. In any case, all creatures within  the
effect  will  experience a temporary clarity of thought. Note that  this  may
make the subject more vulnerable to any mind based eavesdropping such as  ESP
or empathy. The material component for this spell is a 1000 gp gem hanging on
a chain which must be wound around the priest's hand while he claps.

With this ceremony, the priest call upon and wakens the spirit of the forest.
The  effects  are that the priest becomes one with the trees in the  area  of
effect.  Whatever happens in that area, the priest instantaneously knows.  He
has  the power to cause one tree per level within that area to animate as  if
it  were  a treant. Any real treants in the area become aware of him and  are
receptive  to  any  suggestions made by the priest. A  changestaff  (see  the
changestaff  spell)  is  needed too, if any trees  are  animated.  Each  tree
animated reduces the changestaff by one Hit Die.

This  devotion  allows the somniomancer to wake another  character
from  normal  sleep without the use of touch or sound.  When  this
devotion  is  used  the subject simply wakes up  instantly.  (This
doesn't mean that the subject is immediately alert)
     The subject hears (only in her mind) a great shout "wake up!"
or  any  word the somniomancer wants (one word only). The  subject
may be scared or hungry depends on situation.
      At  DM  discretion this power can cause problems  when  used
against subjects in astral travel.

Power Score:  The subject is alert upon awakening.

20:   The psionicist wakes the character up, but in such a  manner
that the character is paranoid for the day.  All actions at -5% (-
1) for the day.  Dexterity checks at -2 because of nervous shakes.

This  spell is similar to Azalldam's fabricated bridge, except that it shapes
a boat from the conjured shadows instead of a bridge. The wizard may create a
boat  of 50 square feet per level (up to a maximum of 1000 square feet).  The
boat  will support 100 pounds per level of the wizard; any additional  weight
will cause the boat to capsize. The spell will last 1 turn for each level  of
the wizard, or until the wizard ends it.
Similar to fabricated bridge, the boat may cannot be disbelieved, but may  be
dispelled.

The  material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of  a  boat;
this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

     Using this spell, the wizard conjures material from the plane of shadows
and  uses it to shape a semi-real bridge. This bridge is 5 yards wide and  10
yards  long  per level of the wizard; both ends of the bridge  must  rest  on
solid ground. The bridge will support 100 poundsper level of the wizard;  any
additional  weight will cause it to collapse. The bridge will  normally  last
for 2 rounds per level of the wizard, but the wizard may end the spell with a
single word.

      The bridge is not an illusion per se, and so cannot be disbelieved;  it
may however, be dispelled normally.

The  material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of a bridge;
this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell causes a high-pressured cone of water to stream from the wizard's
hand;  this  cone is 50 feet long, 5 feet wide at the wizard's hand,  and  15
feet  wide at the base. The majority of damage is caused by the high pressure
of  the stream; anyone caught inside the area of effect suffers 3d8 points of
damage; a successful saving throw versus spell will reduce this damage by one
half.  Those  who  fail  their saving throws must roll saving  throws  versus
crushing  blow  for  all  their possessions to avoid  their  destruction.  In
addition,  victims who fail their initial saving throws must make a Dexterity
check; if this check fails, the target is pushed backwards 1d20 yards, and is
knocked prone.
The  water from this spell will extinguish any normal fires, but has  only  a
50% chance to put out magical fires. This spell will inflict double damage on
fire elementals or similar creatures.

The  material  component for this spell is a large beaker of water  which  is
used up when the spell is cast.

Similar  to  the  priest spell silence, this spell only differs  in  area  of
effect.  The recipient of this spell can extend the area of effect  up  to  a
maximum  10  foot or to the minimum of hugging him skin tight and  even  only
covering certain parts of his body. The area of effect can be shaped  however
the recipient wishes, all by mental command (verbal commands would defeat the
purpose). Fluxuating silence is ideal for being stealthy but retaining  spell
casting ability.

This  spell  renders an area completely immune to fire. No normal fires  will
burn  within the area of effect. Magical fires will burn but will not  ignite
anything.  This  spell will not stop damage from heat. The  reverse  of  this
spell,  Aziel's building's vulnerability to fire, will negate the protection,
but its area of effect is limited to only affect certain small areas to allow
for  fireplaces and cooking hearths within the protected area. This spell was
created  to  protect  the  Great Library of Alexandra  in  my  campaign.  The
building  must  fit in a 50-foot per level of the caster cube.  The  material
component for this spell is a miniature maquette of the house being protected
from fire.

The  black  scythe  is  a fearsome weapon to behold, stretching  8  feet  and
immolated in wispy green flames. It sweeps a 10-foot long, 180  arc  and  can
hit all targets within its area as a monster of the wizard's level. Creatures
up  to 4+1 HD are slain instantly, while those above 4+1 HD but below 8+3  HD
must save versus spell or be stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. Those who possess  8+3
HD  up  to  10  HD  must save versus spell or be slowed for 1d4  rounds.  All
effects  are cumulative. The scythe inflicts 1d10 damage in addition  to  its
other  effects. The material component is a miniature sickle  with  an  ebony
shaft and an adamantine blade costing 500 gp to construct.

Upon casting a death shadow, the wizard brings fora special creature from the
elemental plane of shadow. The recipient of the death shadow feels a chilling
sensation followed by warmth as it merges with his actual shadow. Thereafter,
once  a situation occurs where the recipient takes a death stroke of any sort
(failing  to  save versus poison, taking damage from an attack  which  causes
death  etc.) the shadow pushes him to a place of safety and takes  the  death
stroke  itself, disappearing in a black puff of smoke. The spell may last  up
to one day per spell level of the wizard before the shadow departs.
Note  that  the  death shadow does not provide an instant escape  route  from
certain death (being immersed in acid, falling off a cliff, etc.). It  merely
takes  one  death  blow which would have normally killed the  character,  and
there  must be an immediate place of safety within 10 feet for the shadow  to
place  its  host.  The material components for this spell are  coal,  special
incense (value 200 gp), and a drop of blood, all of which are burned  at  the
start of casting.

When  the  wizard casts the soul whip, he creates a shimmering ebony  tendril
which  lashes out at one specific creature within 20 feet. A to-hit  roll  is
necessary,  but the whip strikes once per round as a monster of the  wizard's
Hit  Dice, and on an unmodified roll of 20, the whip entangles its victim for
1d4+1 rounds (no to-hit needed during that time). Whenever the weapon touches
its target, it inflicts 1d8+3 damage points, and these points are immediately
gained  by the spell wizard and heals any damage previously incurred. If  the
wizard's  hit  points rise above maximum normal hit points,  then  the  extra
points will remain for only 1 turn. The material component is a small leather
whip.

This   power  causes a psychic shock to travel along  the  psychic
conduit   formed  by  contact.   It may only be used after contact
has been  established, by either the psionicist or by the opponent
(i.e.,  it   will  travel either way).  This  psychic  shock  will
directly damage the  opponent,  causing  1d6  damage for  every  5
PSP's  spent  (save  vs death  to  reduce this  by  half,  maximum
damage  is  10d6  for 50 PSP's).  There  is  however   some   risk
involved  in using this power.  If the power  check   is   failed,
the  psionicist must make a saving throw or suffer half the damage
that he/she wanted to inflict on the opponent.

Power Score:  Opponent automatically fails the saving throw.

20:  Psionicist suffers full damage, no saving throw allowed.

This  spell  creates  an invisible magical field covering  the  back  of  the
spellcaster from head to toe. Should a thief attempt to backstab the  wizard,
or  anyone else who attacks the mage's rear, the wizard will take full damage
from  the  attack. But the attacker will be hit with a blast  of  pure  force
which does twice the damage of the attack, with no saving throw. Each casting
creates a one-shot field. This spell will only be activated if the wizard  is
attacked  by  a  hand-held  weapon at close range; thrown  weapons  will  not
activate the spell (as there is no one to blast). The spell effects are  non-
cumulative, only one spell in affect at anytime.
This spell was created by a wizard who had one too many spells disrupted by a
thief's  backstab. Whenever there is a combat situation where the  wizard  is
surrounded or he sees a thief, this is usually the first spell he casts.

Balefire  is  a  very nasty spell. The caster must roll to hit  the  subject,
using only Dexterity-related bonuses to Armour Class - armour does not affect
the  chances  of being hit. A being or object hit ceases to exist.  Moreover,
the  being or object hit, after being hit, didn't even exist before he or  it
was  hit.  Thus,  actions taken by a person hit by Balefire  are  reversed  -
people  slain  are  brought back to life, etc. The  area  of  effect  vaguely
resembles a sword or broom, and can be swept along to cause even more damage.

Ball  of  iron  is  a  special form of the spell wall  of  iron,  useful  for
offensive combat. Any spellcaster who has wall of iron can cast ball of  iron
and vice versa. The spell does 1d10 points of damage for every two levels  of
the  spellcaster, rounded down, to anything hit by it (i.e.: 5d10  at  tenth,
6d10 at thirteenth, etc.). Further, if the saving throw is failed, there is a
percentage chance equal to 10 plus the Armour Class of the target that a limb
(i.e.:  an  arm or leg, not the head) is crushed under the ball and  rendered
useless. Huge and gargantuan creatures (12 feet or higher) are immune to limb
crushing.  For  purposes of breaking down portals, the ball  strikes  with  a
force equal to 25 Strength. Moving the ball (not lifting it) also requires 25
Strength. The ball does siege damage (see the AD&D Battlesystem) equal  to  a
heavy catapult or a boulder thrown by a storm giant, whichever is greater.

This  spell  enables  the caster to prevent a female from becoming  pregnant.
Essentially, it impedes a fertilized ovum from implanting in the uterus.  The
casting of Baltasar's impediment is not necessarily an evil act, but  the  DM
should pay particular attention to the alignment of the caster as well as the
social and political (especially religious) atmosphere. For example, a lawful
good  priest casting this spell on a teenager without the permission  of  her
parents, church, etc. should be prepared for the wrath of his deity. A priest
who worships a fertility god cannot cast this spell.
A  neutral evil priest, nephew of the king, might repeatedly cast this  spell
on  the  queen in a secret attempt to usurp the thrown. A neutral good priest
might  cast this spell on all the maidens of the keep before its fall to  the
orc  siege   although he cannot spare them from the horrors to come, at least
he can prevent the bastardization that might result.
The  material components are a drop of blood from the target's last menstrual
period  (or  an ounce of her blood, from anywhere, that has been  mixed  with
dust  and dried in a silver chalice) and the priest's holy symbol. The priest
invokes  the  name of his deity, touching his holy symbol to the  blood.  The
woman  must then consume it, usually mixing it with wine or some other fluid.
The spell remains in effect until the first day of the woman's next menstrual
period, or until a successful dispel magic is cast upon her.

This spell calls into existence misty rings around a single target of size  M
or  smaller. These rings exert 640 pounds of force to keep the target  still,
including  short  range movements such as swinging a sword.  Every  time  the
target  attempts  to  do  something not requiring moving  from  her  original
position  (walking  is  out)  he  must make a  Dexterity  check  (roll  under
Dexterity  on  1d20) in order to have a chance of success. In order  to  move
from his original position, the target will have a harder time of it. If  his
Strength totals higher than 23, he can do it easily. Otherwise he must make a
Strength  check against opening magical doors in order to break  out  of  the
bonds.  The caster tosses a looped copper wire at the victim while  muttering
the appropriate verbal components.
This  is  a weakened version of hold person, which exerts physical  force  to
hold the target rather than paralysing her.

This  spell creates a higher-level wall of force (q.v.) that is in the  shape
of a sphere. It is mobile if centred on the caster and immobile if centred on
a location.
The  sphere is totally impervious to all physical blows, and spells of  ninth
level  and  below. It prevents any passage into it by physical, ethereal,  or
spell  means.  However,  it has no influence toward  any  force  leaving  the
sphere.  Therefore, a fireball spell, for example, thrown against the barrier
will  glance  off harmlessly, but a fireball my be thrown out of  the  sphere
with  normal  effect. Creatures with magic resistance are always affected  by
the barrier.
If  the barrier is mobile, and the caster moves, any and all objects that hit
the  wall  are casually pushed aside, regardless of the relative strength  of
the  wizard. Therefore, a wizard armed with this spell, while also under  the
influence of a fly spell, could be a great wrecking ball. It is important  to
note,  however, that if the caster walks along the ground, the  barrier  will
push  aside the earth that rests in its path, thus causing the wizard to walk
in a trench of ever increasing depth.

The  material  components are an uncharged cube of  force,  a  3-inch  hollow
sphere of mithril, and a sanctified silver holy symbol of the primary god  of
protection.

This  spell enables the caster to assume the control of an elemental creature
conjured by another spellcaster or magic device. Magic devices are considered
spellcasters of twelfth level. The domination is successful on a roll  of  11
on a d20 (50%: you must roll an 11 or better), modified as follows:
           if  the caster is of higher level than the conjurer, subtract  the
difference in level from the base throw.
           if  the  caster  is  of  lower level than the  conjurer,  add  the
difference in level from the base throw.
           if  the  caster is an elementalist, he has an additional modifier:
2  if  the  elemental  is of the same element as the  caster;     +2  if  the
elemental is of the opposite element as the caster;    +0 in any other case.
           at  the DMs option, you can modify the roll with something we  may
call the willpower: the Wisdom bonus for priests, the Intelligence bonus  for
wizards,  the  better  of  the  two for cleric/mages;  subtract  or  add  the
difference in willpower of the two spellcasters.
If  the  spell  fails,  the elemental attacks the spellcaster  who  cast  the
domination  for at least 4 rounds of fury without control, then the  conjurer
can  restart  to  control  the elemental (i.e., he  can  choose  to  let  the
elemental finish the work or command it to a different target).
The duration of the spell is 1 turn per level but it can never be higher than
the  remaining  time  of  the original conjuration spell  (see  the  Player's
Handbook,  pages  227 and 232). The material component is the  caster's  holy
symbol.
In  the Dark Sun setting this spell will work differently with respect to how
powerful  the elemental to be dominated is: if you try to dominate  a  lesser
elemental,  the  duration of the spell is increased by 3 turns  (Duration:  3
turns  +  1  turn per level). If you try to dominate a normal elemental,  the
spell  works as described above. If you try to dominate a greater  elemental,
the  spell works only on an elemental of your school, without any same-school
bonus, and the duration of the spell is a quarter of usual (Duration: 1  turn
per 4 levels).
NB:  this  spell can be cast only on elementals that are conjured, and  works
only for elementals that are already controlled by another spellcaster.

At the culmination of this spell, the priest utters a deafening cry or shriek
drawing  the attentions of all hostile creatures within the area  of  effect.
1d6 HD of these creatures per level of the priest are stunned for 1d3 rounds;
this affects creatures with the lowest Hit Dice first. All affected creatures
will  thereafter attempt to physically attack the priest, foregoing any other
actions. The desire to hunt down the priest will remain for 6 rounds or until
the priest is slain.
At  the  same  time,  all friendly creatures within the range  of  the  spell
receive  the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws).
Friendly  creatures also receive a +1 to their morale checks as long  as  the
priest remains alive. Undead or creatures with Intelligence less than  5  are
not affected by this spell.

When  this spell is cast, the wizard causes his features to shift in the mind
of  his victim to conform to those of an individual that the victim considers
to  be  the  ultimate lover. Once the spell is successfully cast (the  saving
throw  varies according to the amount of preparation in casting  the  spell),
the  recipient  will  be  putty  in the hands  of  the  caster,  not  out  of
enchantment but only out of the recipient's own sense of wish-fulfilment.
This spell takes as much time to cast as it takes to get the recipient drunk.
The  more  thoroughly tanked up the recipient gets, the  worse  will  be  the
saving throw (see the Net Alcohol Guide for more information):

     Recipient's    Saving Throw
     State     Modifier
     Had a serving of alcohol -1
     Slightly intoxicated     -2
     Moderately intoxicated   -4
     Greatly intoxicated -8

The  material  component of this spell is a large quantity of alcohol,  which
must be passed through the gullet of the recipient.

The  wizard is able to transform himself into water upon casting this  spell.
The  amount of water the wizard will become is of equal mass to the  caster's
body. While in water form, the caster is able to move at MV 18 underwater, or
MV  6  on the ground. The wizard only has limited control of their body while
in  the  water  form, and cannot make any attacks, manipulate  objects,  cast
spells,  or other things requiring a physical form. They can flow across  the
ground,  go  between cracks, move freely in water, and whisk away objects  in
their waves. The caster cannot form water appendages or raise themselves  off
the ground. While under become water's effects, the wizard can only by hit by
magical weapons.

The  material  component to this spell is a bit of water from a water  weird,
water  elemental,  or other creature composed entirely of  water,  which  the
caster drinks during casting.

This spell summons a variable number of beetles to fight for the wizard.  The
beetles  cannot  be  used for other tasks. The type of  beetle  that  can  be
summoned depends on the level of the wizard:

     Wizard's Level Summoned Beetles
     7-10 fire, bombardier
     11-13     water, boring
     14-17     stag, slicer
     18+  death watch (11 HD), rhinoceros

Note that beetles from a lesser level may always be summoned. Up to 1 HD  per
level of the wizard can be summoned (round down). Only one type of beetle can
be  summoned, and all remainders are dropped. Other types of beetles  may  be
summoned  at the DM's discretion. The material component of this spell  is  a
small, live beetle.

The  battery spell allows the caster to store spell energy for use at a later
time.  The  caster creates a temporary magic item called the battery.  Within
this  battery,  he can store one spell level per casting level.  Charges  (as
these  stored  levels are called) are semi-permanent meaning that  they  will
remain until dispelled. Anti-magic shells and similar magics will only negate
the  use of a battery while such are within their area of effect, the battery
will not be dispelled.
Stored  levels  are  withdrawn  from the  spells  the  priest  has  currently
memorised, with the highest level spells being removed first. In other words,
this  spell  is best cast when the priest is not expecting to be needing  his
high  level  spells. Using a bejuryl stone (or any other DM-chosen  expensive
object)  of 1000 gp worth per charge to be stored (fourteenth level means  14
charges,  which accounts to 14,000 gp), the priest casts this spell and  then
begins to power the battery by losing one spell level per hour (so the  above
gem  would  take 14 hours to charge) into the gem. Spells which are partially
removed  cannot be cast, and if the battery is fully charged with part  of  a
spell  remaining, then that partial spell is also lost. The charging  process
will never take more than 24 hours no matter how many charges are needed.
The charges are then stored within the gem and can be recalled at any time in
the  future.  The  caster must use the battery to cast his  spells,  and  the
charges  can  only  be  used  to cast spells that the  priest  currently  has
memorised   it cannot be used to cast whatever spell the priest wants, and it
certainly  cannot  be  used  to  cast a spell outside  the  priest's  allowed
spheres. Any number of charges up to 7 can be withdrawn in a round,  and  any
spell  cast while using the battery remains in the priest's mind, and can  be
cast  normally  at a later date. Spells cast with the battery have  a  normal
casting  time,  and all components (other than material) must  be  used.  The
battery  takes the place of the regular material components, and is  consumed
when the last spell is released.
The  caster  can have only 1 battery in effect at one time, and  when  it  is
drained of charges it becomes a worthless glass sphere. Note that this  spell
can  be  used to power any spell of any level (which the priest can  normally
cast), but as its primary use is to allow the priest to recover spells whilst
in  an  area which prevents this. Normally, only spells of higher than  third
level  will  be cast with the battery, as 3rd-level and lower spells  can  be
regained by the priest without contact with his deity.

Casting  this spell can have quite unpredictable effects, i.e.,  no  one  can
predict  what will happen after the spell's duration has expired. When  cast,
all  creatures within 100 feet of the priest are immediately overcome  by  an
enormous feeling of joy and an irresistible desire to party. No saving  throw
is applicable.
For  exactly  one hour, everyone within the area of effect will  party:  they
will drink, sing, dance, and otherwise rejoice. Also, all within the area  of
effect  will  experience  nothing  like hatred,  fear,  or  other  "negative"
feelings. All others will be considered friends, for the time being.
Anyone  entering the area of effect must make a saving throw versus spell  to
avoid  being  affected. This roll is repeated every round. Those leaving  the
area  of effect will remain under the spell's effect, but upon noticing  that
they  are  leaving  the fun place, they will probably try to  return  to  the
party, since they're really "in the mood".
Note  that the area of effect moves with the priest, that the priest  himself
is  always  affected by the spell, and that those affected by the spell  will
probably  have  run out of alcohol at the end of the spell's  duration.  Some
liquid  containing alcohol is the material component for this spell,  by  the
way.

The  spell  creates a powerful bolt of plasma that in inflicts 1d8 points  of
damage  per level to anyone in its area of effect (maximum damage  is  12d8).
This  bolt  is  60 feet long x 5 feet wide, it cannot be forked.  It  streaks
outward  much  like a lightning bolt. It does not reflect,  however.  If  the
firebolt  hits a wall, the plasma spreads out in a 5-foot radius  hemisphere,
anyone  in  the hemisphere takes damage. Thus it is possible to  hit  someone
standing  near  a wall twice with the firebolt, once with the bolt  and  once
with  the  hemisphere.  The  firebolt automatically  sets  fire  to  anything
combustible  in  the  path  or  in the hemisphere.  The  bolt  has  the  same
penetration ability as a lightning bolt. The material components are a stick,
a bit of sulphur, and a dab of royal honey.

When  this  spell  is cast, it invokes the priest's deity to  instill  battle
madness upon his followers. This causes them to turn into berserkers. When in
this  state, they only attack enemies and not each other or their allies.  In
game  terms,  the effects of this state are that the warriors  gain  a  large
morale  bonus  (+60),  a  to-hit (+1) and damage (+2) bonus,  and  additional
attacks per round (+®).
The  major  restriction for this spell is that the recipients of  this  spell
must  be  true followers of the priest's god. Also, they will tend  to  fight
until  the  spell finishes or there is a severe morale failure. The  material
component of this spell is a specimen of the priest's god's preferred weapon.
This spell is used exclusively by warrior priests.

not  from  Bigby).  A  quasi-real hand (five feet) comes into  existence  and
smacks  the nearest women that the caster commands it to. If the woman  knows
her  place  is  in the kitchen, the hand only does 1 point  of  damage  as  a
reminder.  However, if the woman has complained, whined or not  been  to  the
kitchen in three days, the hand instantly grows to a Titan's hand's size  (25
feet)  and knocks the woman into the nearest kitchen (be it 10 feet or 10,000
miles)  and  forces  her  to cook a three course meal.  If  she  continuously
refuses, the hand will inflict damage on her until she submits (DM's decision
on  damage  per hit). The hand has as many hit points as the caster  in  full
health and has an Armour Class of 0. The material component of the spell is a
leather glove.
The  reverse of this spell, Bigbabs' brute slap, is quite alike, except  that
it  only works on males, to remind them that they should leave the house  and
go  to  work. The man is immediately reminded that he should work,  not  hang
around  in,  say, a comfy living room or bar. The hand evoked  will  continue
slapping  the  male  until  he submits and goes  to  work.  If  the  man  had
complained, abused women at work, or not been to work in three days, the hand
will  grow  to  25 feet and beat the man until he complies,  forcing  him  to
perform overwork for at least two hours.

This  spell is the lesser known cousin of the Bigby's fist spells.  It,  upon
casting,  causes the victim (one bitch per level of the caster) to be  struck
by  a  stinging slap, disrupting any and all actions that were  going  to  be
taken  by  said bitch for that round, plus one round for every two levels  of
the  caster. It also causes 1d4 points of ego damage to the bitch  per  every
three  levels  of  the  caster. The verbal component of  this  spell  is  the
uttering  of  the word, "Bitch" while enacting the somatic component  of  the
spell,  which  is a strong forehanded swing (or backhanded, or both,  all  at
DM's option).
This  spell  got  its start when the apprentice Bigby and his  close  friends
Bryan  and  Seth  were all three simultaneously seriously peeved  at  several
bitches  (note:  the  lack  of  gender  attached  to  the  term  "Bitch"   is
intentional. Yes, I'm covering my tail, but...) and concocted this spell as a
revenge  method.  Bryan and Seth went on to become boot salesmen,  and  Bigby
went  on  to become the seriously bad news that he is today. This  spell  has
several  serious uses, especially when dealing with any drow  priestess,  any
elf  or dwarf, and any ex-significant other. Finally, the only thing that  is
known to stop this spell is a wall of force, which only halves the effects.

This  spell  allows the wizard to "grope" his target. This spell  is  usually
used  by  mischievous apprentices in bars and such... Have fun (gee, I  don't
know if I'm hitting a copyright problem by using the name Bigby in here,  but
it  just seems the most appropriate name to use, and for all I care,  if  TSR
wishes to claim this silly spell as their own, so be it)!

Bigby's  strangulation  creates a pair of disembodied  hands  sized  for  the
victim  (up  to 1 foot tall per level of the wizard). These hands materialise
around  the victim's throat and commence strangulation. The victim suffers  1
point  of damage the first round, and each round thereafter, sustains  double
the last round's damage.
Saving  throws: a saving throw is permitted at the beginning of  the  attack,
and  if successful, the spell is ruined. Each round after the first, a saving
throw  for  half  damage  (for that round) is permitted,  as  the  victim  is
struggling to keep his windpipe open. Needless to say, the victim may  engage
in no other activity.
The  hands  cannot be attacked physically, but a successful Dispel  Magic,  a
wand of negation, a hungry disenchanter, etc. will destroy them. The material
component  is  a  pair of gloves made from the skin of a constricting  snake,
such as a python or boa constrictor. Upon casting, the gloves vanish (and are
worn  by  the strangling hands). Once the spell is cast, the wizard need  not
maintain concentration for it to work.

When  cast,  this spell creates a pair of disembodied hands which proceed  to
tickle  a  victim of the wizard's choosing. Each round, the victim must  save
versus  spell  or  suffer a -4 penalty to all rolls. If the saving  throw  is
failed, the victim may cast no spells that round. The wizard may select a new
victim each round. If the wizard's concentration is broken while the spell is
in effect, the spell is terminated.
The  hands  cannot be physically attacked, only dispel magic type attacks  or
breaking  the  wizard's concentration will destroy the  hands.  The  material
components are a pair of gloves and a feather.

When  cast, this spell allows the altered spell to affect the area the wizard
desires, up to 20 cubic feet per level.
For instance, a 19th-level wizard (that's Bilador) could make a wall, 1x19x19
feet  in  any orientation which would be "filled" with the area of effect,  a
solid  dome  in a spherical shape 6 inches thick and having a  radius  of  15
feet,  or  flood  a hemisphere with a radius of 6 feet. A hemispherical  dome
would have a radius of 22 feet at 6 inches thickness, and a cube 7 feet on  a
size could also be shaped.
Any spell can be shaped, as long as the shape has a thickness at the axis  of
at  least 6 inches. For instance, a teleport can move anything "encompassed".
Lightning  bolts become fields of lightning affecting all those  encompassed.
Abjurations can enclose areas or surround people.

This spell binds one spelljamming helm of any kind together with another helm
in  such  a  way that they work together on the same ship. This  is  quite  a
dangerous  process  as  all  helms have to make their  saving  throws  versus
magical  fire  if they are bound together in such a way. If even  one  fails,
they all explode in a 100-foot radius per helm; anything within a distance of
50 feet per exploding helm is destroyed including characters unless they have
magic  resistance or a scarab of protection; in that case they  automatically
make their saving throws. Outside those 50 feet per exploding helm everything
takes  10d20 per helm and they gain a saving throw versus spell;  the  damage
dealt is fire damage; thus, it would be possible to further reduce the damage
with  fire resistance. If the spell works, all helms work at once on the same
ship  and  each one can be manned. This allows for some incredible speed  for
these  spelljamming ships or some quite astonishing sizes  as  all  can  pull
their load of either 50 or 100 tons. This spell is needed for the creation of
a Grand Helm as one that is used on a Quad of Thay.

The material components are the sacrifice of one person per helm to be linked
to  be  linked  per Rary's mindlink with each other (they can be  resurrected
afterwards) plus one diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald, and topaz each no less
than 10,000 gp worth per helm to be linked plus one chain of no less than one
mile  length  made from mithril (thickness doesn't matter) of  no  less  than
25,000 gp worth to be tied around the helms to be linked.

Bind  warder  will  allow the wizard to pass some of his mystical  energy  to
another  person  (usually a fighter), giving that person enhanced  endurance,
the  ability  to sense magical creatures, and enhanced senses;  allowing  the
target  to  sense  where  the caster is at all times  (within  a  mile),  and
allowing  him  to know the condition the caster is in. The caster  can  sense
where the warder is at all times (again, within a mile) and what condition he
is  in. Warders usually tend to defend the spell casters, though this doesn't
have  to be true. This depends on the person who was bound and on the  binder
himself.  Any  wizard can only bind one Warder at the same time.  This  spell
cannot be ended voluntarily.

This  powerful spell is invoked primarily against invading armies or in siege
warfare.  The spell's primary effect is to destroy or prevent the passage  of
troops who have attacked the priest or his comrades. This spell requires  the
priest  to  concentrate for the full duration of the spell. The casting  time
and duration are simultaneous.
In  the  first round of casting, the priest summons an enormous  black  storm
cloud  over the area of effect. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder  rock
the  area,  and  creatures  within  the  area  of  effect  must  save  versus
paralysation of be deafened for 1d4 turns.
On  the  second  round, the priest calls six lightning bolts  down  from  the
cloud.  Each is directed at a specific target, and each bolt does 8d8  points
of damage (A successful saving throw indicates half damage).
On  the  third round, hail stones pound those in the area of effect for  3d10
points of damage (no saving throw).
On  the  fourth and fifth rounds, tornadoes sweep through the area of  effect
toppling 1 creature in 4, and doing 3d6 points of damage to 1 creature in 6.
On  the  sixth  and  seventh rounds, acid rains down on the  area  of  effect
inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage. No saving throw is allowed.
On  the  eighth  and  subsequent rounds, violent rain and wind  gusts  reduce
visibility to five feet and movement is reduced 75%. Missile fire  and  spell
casting from within the area of effect are impossible.
The  sequence  of effects ceases immediately if the priest is disrupted  from
spell  casting at any time. The priest may opt to cancel the effects  at  any
time.

following  the casting. The weapon will attack once for every  level  of  the
caster,  using  attack  rolls of a fighter of half his  level,  doing  normal
damage,  attacking whomever the wizard chooses. The weapon  attacks  once  on
initiative  0,  once on initiative 1, etc. until it has used up  all  of  its
attacks.  The  wizard can act normally on the round the weapon is  attacking.
The  material component of this spell is a small platinum dagger of at  least
500 gp value.

This  spell  brings into being illusionary longswords that  strike  creatures
designated  by the caster. One sword per three levels is created and  may  be
divided  among targets as the caster wishes. Note that it takes  a  round  of
concentration to redirect swords to a new target but any or all swords may be
redirected in that single round.
Each  sword does damage as a magic missile. Every current target creature  is
allowed a saving throw, and if the saving throw succeeds, it takes no  damage
from  the  sword.  Creatures believing the illusion cannot successfully  cast
spells requiring semantic components. The material component of this spell is
a 2 foot long, finely crafted longsword.

      This  cantrip covers the print on the pages of a book and  replaces  it
with  the illusion of blank pages. For the blank pages to be convincing,  the
pages  in  the book must be seen by the caster during the casting,  otherwise
the blank pages might not match up with the real ones. Also, individual pages
may  not be blanked. This is an all or nothing spell. The caster concentrates
on  blankness  while passing her left hand over the book  and  muttering  the
proper words. Katrine developed this one, to her master's chagrin, while  she
was still an apprentice.

When  cast, this spell causes the victim's nose to bleed for the duration  of
the  spell. The victim will loose one hit point every turn of the spell.  The
spell  will  also cause the victim to be highly uncomfortable  and  therefore
fight at only 95% of efficiency (add 1 to the victim's THAC0). The damage can
be  negated by a cure light wounds, or having the nose completely  bound  and
having  the  victim  to lay motionless for the duration  of  the  spell.  The
materialcomponent is a drop of blood.

This  spell  causes any existing wounds (as in painful wounds)  to  start  to
bleed  badly. Wizards do not need to strike their intended foe. If the victim
fails a saving throw versus death magic, he will suffer 1 point of damage per
round,  not including any damage he may take in combat. The DM may choose  to
have the blood get in his eyes, make it difficult to keep a hold on a weapon,
or  possibly  make  the  ground  slippery, if he  so  chooses.  The  material
component for this spell is a 10 or more gold pieces worth diamond.

This  spell  causes a blizzard to hit the area of effect,  resulting  in  the
following:  movement rate is cut in half due to drifts and wind,  no  missile
fire or flying due to wind, and all normal flames are extinguished. This will
negate a heat metal spell, and affects magical fires as if they had been  hit
with a dispel magic. There are no saving throws versus these effects.
In  addition,  great chunks of ice and snow fall within the area  of  effect,
causing 3d12 points of damage per round to anyone caught inside. A successful
saving throw versus spell reduces this damage to half the normal amount.  The
material  components required for this spell are five acorns  and  any  semi-
precious gem worth at least 100 gp.

By  means of a blood burn spell the caster is able to make a creature's blood
boil. Creatures without blood are immune to this effect.
On  the  first  round of the spell, the blood becomes warm and  the  creature
feels  uncomfortable and feverish. During the second through  fourth  rounds,
the  blood  increases temperature until it is burning internal  organs.  Note
this is treated as fire for resistance and regeneration purposes.
Damage is as follows:
     round 1: no damage;
     round 2: 1d4 HP damage;
     round 3: 2d4 HP damage;
     round 4: 4d4 HP damage.

The  material components for this spell are a drop of blood and  a  pinch  of
sulphur.

This  spell causes the recipient to give off the strong smell of blood as  if
they  were bleeding profusely. The victim will take no damage from the  spell
and there are no visible effects, only the scent of blood. The smell attracts
carnivorous  creatures in the area - usually sharks.  The  spell  has  a  10%
chance  of  attracting wandering monsters on the first round  after  casting,
with  an  additional 10% each round thereafter. This chance  increases  to  a
maximum of 90% on the ninth and last round of the spell duration.
The type of creatures appearing depends on the area the spell is cast. The DM
can  do  a wandering monsters check to determine what shows up. The creatures
that  appear will be so strongly attracted to the spell victim that they will
ignore  all other living things in the area. When the spell duration expires,
the  scent immediately disappears and the attracted carnivores will no longer
be attracted to the individual. However, if they successfully drew blood from
the  victim, chances are they will continue to attack. The material component
for this spell is a shark's tooth.
Note:  this spell was created for use underwater. If the DM allows, the spell
can  be  used in a land-based campaign to attract carnivorous creatures.  The
spell may not be as effective out of the water - at the DM's discretion.

The  blood  to  dust  spell converts blood instantly to  an  inert  substance
(dust).  This  spell will instantly kill any one creature upon  which  it  is
cast.  Note that this spell is only effective upon creatures which have blood
or  which  need  blood  to survive. All undead, constructs  (including  flesh
golems), creatures from other planes, and any other monsters that do not need
blood to survive are not harmed by this spell. Casting it upon them will only
change their appearance to dried up, mummy-like husks. Further, all creatures
with 12 HD or more are immune to this spell. Any creature slain by this spell
must  first have the reverse of the spell, dust to blood, cast on them before
being raised. A heal spell will accomplish the same thing, and a resurrection
spell negates the need for either.
When cast at a free standing pool of blood, the spell acts like the 6th-level
priest  spell  transmute water to dust. The spell destroys 1  cubic  yard  (3
cubic  feet)  of  blood  per level of the caster. The reverse  of  the  spell
creates  1 cubic yard of blood per level of the caster when cast at  an  open
area.

The  material components of this spell are a pinch of dust and a drop of  the
caster's blood.

      This spell enhances any "kiss" spell by extending its range to 12  feet
instead  of 0. This spell must be cast one round prior to the kissing  spell.
Any  kissing spell may be used in conjunction with this spell. Note that this
allows  the caster to blow a kiss to those that may not desire one.  Problems
with physical contact during combat and such are thus eliminated.

This spell causes the victim's body to start burning from within. Unless  the
victim  saves versus death magic with a -3 penalty he will be subject to  the
flames,  taking 2d10 points of damage per round. Two rounds after the  flames
start,  and every two rounds thereafter, the victim is allowed another saving
throw,  with one less on the penalty per time (-2 on round 3, -1 on round  5,
and no penalty thereafter).
The  flames  can also be halted by a successful dispel magic, or a protection
from  fire, which works automatically. If the flames burn for three  or  more
rounds,  all  items  on  the  victim must save  versus  magical  fire  or  be
destroyed. If the flames burnfor 5 or more rounds, the items save with  a  -2
penalty. Any creature not naturally resistant to magical fire can be affected
by this spell, even those without solid bodies, such as shadows and spectres.
The material component is a red gemstone of any type worth 500 gp.

A  cold  blooded  or  non-living creature (undead) receiving  this  spell  is
becoming  warm, his heartbeat can be felt and all forms of detect  life  give
positive answers.
If  the  creature is not intelligent, it is entitled to a saving throw versus
spell. Otherwise, the spell can be cast on a willing recipient and is stopped
at  his wish. In any case, the spell will not last over a day. The spell  has
no  effect  on  warm  blooded  creatures, nor  does  it  inflict  any  damage
whatsoever to the receiving creature. It might, at the DM's decision, disable
the creature from doing things related to his cold blooded organism.
The  material components are the priest's holy symbol and a light source. The
light  (preferably  sunlight) is to be reflected upon the affected  creature,
while the priest lays his other hand upon its heart.
The  reverse, body chill, has the reverse effect upon warm blooded  creatures
(no heartbeat can be found, detect life gives negative answer etc.).

     With this cantrip, the wizard can heat the water (or water-based liquid)
in  a  container of up to a quart to boiling. The wizard must concentrate  on
the  container  during  the entire casting. The cantrip  is  used  mainly  by
herbalists, who use it to create poultices and draughts quickly.

This  spell forces a 20-foot diameter circular area of water into an  extreme
boil. All creatures in the area of effect take 1d4 points of damage per level
of the caster (maximum of 12d4 points). A saving throw indicates half damage.
The  water in the globe will drop to a tolerable level on the next round, and
then slowly cool down to normal water temperature. Creatures not affected  by
heat  or  fire are immune to the effects. Ice will instantly boil  under  the
effects  of  this  spell, as well. The globe can be created  anywhere  within
range of the caster.

The material component of this spell is a piece of volcanic rock.

This  spell  creates a powerful bolt of stone, approximately two  feet  long,
which  strikes  its  target without fail up to the maximum  range.  The  bolt
inflicts  1d6 points of damage per level, to a maximum of 10d6. As well,  any
creature struck by the bolt must save versus petrification or be stunned  for
one  round  per  two levels of the wizard. A separate saving  throw  is  also
allowed for half damage. The bolt can be used to open doors as a frost  giant
and  inflicts damage to structures as a large catapult. Objects struck by the
bolt  may  have  to make a saving throw versus crushing blow to  avoid  being
destroyed,  at  the DM's option. The material component of  the  spell  is  a
polished piece of marble.

This  spell  is  an offshoot of the silence concept. Instead  of  creating  a
specific  zone  of silence, this spell alters the sounds created  within  its
area  of  effect  to  match the volume and types of sounds  already  present.
Instead of clashing swords, dying screams and spell recitation, the sounds of
wind,  a  passing wagon, a barking dog or whatever other ambient noise  appto
the  location  is  heard.  By  not silencing  the  area  closely  around  the
recipient,  spells can be cast and conversations carried out as long  as  the
people are within each other's zone and both have the spell cast on them.
The area of effect is one person or person sized object plus the space within
one  foot  of the target. A person or animal passing within the spell's  zone
would hear the noises truly associated with what is happening. For example, a
guard  leaning against a door would hear the efforts of a thief  picking  the
lock  on  the other side of the door because the guard is within the  thief's
area  of effect. The material component of this spell is a small paper  cone,
held to the ear.

Hell   hail  is  a  fire  version  of  ice  storm  with  some  implementation
differences. As a storm, it has the same area of effect as an ice storm,  but
causes  only 3d8 for damage. The storm is largish hailstones that  drop  from
above.  On  impact, they burst in a fiery flash of heat and energy.  It  will
ignite  flammable  materials failing their saving throws  and  break  fragile
containers on impact, perhaps igniting the contents. The storm is unlikely to
burn  a  table, stout chairs, large logs, leather objects and the  like,  The
storm  doesn't last long enough to light them. In this form, its duration  is
instantaneous.
When  cast  as  a sheet of flames, its effect is quite different.  While  the
spell  has a longer duration in this mode (1 round per level of the  caster),
it  has only one initial flash of heat and power, so thin hair, very dry  and
thin paper or other fiery substances will be consumed. Scrolls, books and the
like  will not be harmed unless they are unrolled, open, in use or  in  other
vulnerable  circumstances. Even then, only the exposed areas will suffer  the
damage.  Creatures  are  not  normally harmed though  small  insects  may  be
consumed  in  the initial flash. The area radiates heat, but  not  enough  to
cause damage, though passing through will be uncomfortable. The fires rage  7
feet high in the area for the duration of the spell and may block vision. The
crackling of the flames makes communication across the field difficult if not
impossible. Low Intelligence creatures won't enter the burning area and  will
try  to  flee from the fire zone immediately. Standard Intelligence creatures
must  make  a saving throw versus paralysation to willingly enter  the  area.
High Intelligence creatures may enter and exit the area freely.

This  spell calls into being a magical long bow, consisting entirely of human
bones.  For each round that the spell is in use the caster can fire two  bone
arrows a round. These are shot with long bow range brackets at a THAC0  of  a
fighter of half the wizard's level. These count as +3 for what creatures  can
be  hit,  are  not  stopped by magic resistance and  do  1d8+2  damage  (plus
Strength bonus) each hit.

The material components are a wish bone and a length of silk thread.

This  spell  causes  the  bone  joints of a  creature  to  lock,  effectively
immobilizing  it for the duration of the spell unless it makes  a  successful
saving  throw  versus  death magic. Even if the saving  throw  is  made,  the
creature is slowed. Obviously, a creature must have a bone structure in order
for  this  spell to be effective. Any creature that is entirely  composed  of
bone saves at -3. The material component of the spell is a bone shard.

With  the  aid  of  this spell, the caster may take bone and  mould  it  into
whatever  shape is desired. The spell takes 1 round to cast and an additional
10  rounds  to  shape  the desired object. Bones can be  melded  together  to
produce  one  final object, but no more than one object may be  produced  per
casting.  The  object can not exceed the area of effect of the spell  (though
two objects created by the spell may be joined together with another casting.
The  new object will be seamless and quite strong. The material component for
this spell is fresh bone dust (no more than 1 hour old) spread over the bone,
the  bone may then be sculpted like clay. Strengthened bone may not be joined
to normal bone, though it may be joined to another piece of strengthened bone
(in  this case the bone dust may be no more then ten minutes old when  it  is
spread  on  the  bone and must be made into a paste with  the  blood  of  the
creature the dust comes from, the blood must also be fresh).

This  is  a  more  powerful version of the 5th-level  bone  splinter.  It  is
identical  to  that spell except that is has a +3 to-hit bonus and  causes  a
serious  compound fracture when a hit is scored in melee, with the  following
results:

     Place     Modifier  Effects
      head  -8   major skull fracture: save versus spell or die; else  suffer
4d8 points of damage
     arm* -4   major broken arm: arm is totally useless; it cannot be used to
attack or defend with
      leg*  -4   major broken leg: leg is totally useless; movement  is  half
normal
      ribs -4   broken rib: loss of 1d6 Constitution points and 2d8 points of
damage
      spine**    -8    severed  vertebrae: save versus  spell  or  die;  else
paralysed until healed or cured
      pelvis     -4    major hip fracture: -6 to Dexterity when  using  legs;
movement rate is at one quarter of normal; suffer 3d8 points of damage
* If attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be targeted.
** The spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

Cure  critical  wounds is required to heal one of these effects  (except  for
paralysis,  which  must be cured by normal means) as long as  the  victim  is
still  alive,  and a heal spell will fully restore a living  victim  to  full
health.

The  material components for this spell are an intact bone of at least a foot
in  length,  and a large metal hammer which are consumed when  the  spell  is
cast.

Once  this spell is cast, it will affect a single target that must be hit  in
melee  by  the  wizard.  The target will suffer a minor  bone  fracture  when
affected by this spell. If the wizard misses, additional attacks may be  made
in  following  rounds, as long as the spell duration allows. The  spell  ends
when a hit is scored, or when the duration expires, whichever comes first.
The  wizard  uses his normal THAC0 with a +1 to-hit bonus, but  must  make  a
called  shot (see the Complete Fighter's Handbook for details) to one of  the
hit  locations listed below; the appropriate to-hit modifier must be  applied
to  the combat roll. Normal attacks are not considered accurate enough to  do
any real damage with this spell.
The  possible  hit locations, along with their combat modifier, restrictions,
and effects are as follows:

     Place     Modif.    To-Hit Effects
      head -8   minor skull fracture: 2d8 points of damage (save versus spell
for half damage).
     arm* -4   minor broken arm: -2 to Strength and Dexterity when using this
arm; -2 to-hit, or shield worthless 50% of the time.
      leg*  -4   minor broken leg: -2 to Dexterity when using this leg (i.e.,
defensive adjustment); movement rate is at three quarters normal.
      ribs  -4   cracked rib: loss of 1d4 Constitution points and suffer  1d6
points of damage (no saving throw).
      spine**   -8   cracked vertebrae: save versus spell or become paralysed
for 2d10 rounds.
      pelvis     -4    minor hip fracture: -4 to Dexterity when  using  legs;
movement rate is at half normal.
* If attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be targeted.
** The spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

Multiple hits inflict cumulative damage. A cure serious wounds will heal  one
of  these  effects, but will not heal any associated hit point loss  (another
cure  spell  is  required to do so). A cure critical  wounds  will  heal  two
effects, and a heal will fully restore the victim (unless dead).

The  material components for this spell are a bit of bone and a  small  metal
hammer, both of which are consumed when the spell is cast.
Author's note: the requirement for called shots is simply for convenience; if
the  DM  wishes to compile a hit location chart, then normal attacks  may  be
used in addition to called shots.

This spell, when cast properly, will cause the living creature (provided  its
anatomy is structured with bones) to have its bones become brittle, and in  2
rounds  after successful spell completion, the creature collapses  under  the
weight  of  its  own body, unable to function or move - for  its  bones  have
crumbled to dust.
The  caster  can  only affect creatures that possess the Hit  Dice  that  are
within range of the caster. The spell will affect 1 Hit Dice per level of the
caster  (creatures with the lowest Hit Dice are affected first). The material
component  of  this spell is a miniature grinder, which is  consumed  in  the
casting.

Bone to mud changes all the bones in any one creature, regardless of size, to
mud.  It has no effect on inanimate objects. Obviously, this does not have  a
very  big  effect  on  creatures which do not rely on  an  internal  skeletal
structure (a worm, for example). The spell does affect undead, who save as if
they  were two levels lower than their actual Hit Dice. Creatures present  at
the  end  of  the  casting of this spell must save versus  death  magic  with
effects as in the table below.

Boot-to-the-head  causes a large boot to appear near the head  of  the  spell
recipient  and  kick him in the head. The spell recipient  must  save  versus
spell (with modifiers) or be stunned for 1 round. Modifiers are: -2 per level
below  caster, +2 per level above caster. For each hit, the boot  does  1d4+2
stunning  damage. If the stun damage total matches or exceeds the  total  hit
points  of the target, the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds  +1  round
per  level of the caster. Note: no actual damage is done by boot-to-the-head.
The  target of the spell may not be changed once the spell is cast; the  boot
will  continue  to  kick  unconscious  creatures  until  the  spell  expires.
Concentration need not be maintained once the spell is cast.
The spell caster must be wearing a boot. The spell is invoked by pointing  to
the  creature  to be affected, making a kicking motion with the booted  foot,
saying  "boot to the head". The boot on the caster's foot does not  disappear
with the casting of the spell.

This  spell  provides protection against backstabbing. When the recipient  of
the  spell  is  backstabbed,  a cloud of acid is  created  behind  the  spell
recipient  which blows back and out to form a semi-sphere 8 feet  in  radius.
All  within this area, the recipient not included, take 6d4+6 points of  acid
damage.  Note that the backstabber gets no saving throw (due to surprise  and
proximity), all others receive half damage upon a successful saving throw.
A  backstabbing  attack  is  any physical attack or  combination  of  attacks
initiated  from  behind which causes damage equal to one  fifth  or  mof  the
victims hit points at the time of the attack, assuming the attacker is within
8  feet  of  the victim when the attack is initiated. The spell is in  effect
until dispelled or discharged. This spell will work in combination with other
defensive spells.

The  material component is 100 red ants which must be rolled in  the  wizards
hands,  the  husks then thrown over each shoulder of the recipient,  and  the
juice rubbed into the recipients back.

This  spell is a higher powered version of remove curse. Instead of  removing
the  curse  (which means to some priests that the curse is just relocated  to
another area, item or object), this spell breaks and destroys it. It takes  a
lot more time to break a curse than to remove one. Thus, the casting time  is
1  hour or more. For each hour, the caster and the curse (i.e. the creator of
the  curse)  get a saving throw versus spell at their base saving throws  (no
bonuses  except  race).  These  saving throws are  modified  due  to  special
circumstances. If, for example, the priest is in the holiest  of  his  temple
wielding  one  of  the greatest artifacts of his religion  against  a  simple
cursed sword, -1, the saving throws would be modified very positively in  the
direction  of the priest and very negatively to the side of the  sword  (DM's
judgement). Each failed saving throw causes the next saving throw to be  made
as  if  the creature or item were one level lower. If both fail their  saving
throws,  both  lower  their respective levels. This level  loss  is  only  in
respect to their saving throws against each other   they do not actually lose
levels. Once the curse side loses all levels, the curse is broken. This means
that the item is now changed into a normal magic item of the kind it tried to
depict  in  the  beginning. If the priest loses all levels, he  has  to  save
versus  death magic once per lost level (this time again against base  saving
throw). Per failed saving throw versus death magic the priest actually  loses
one  level permanently. They may be restored with restoration. If both  reach
zero  levels at once, then the priest is sucked into the item or  area  which
now  seems to be cursed with another curse instead of its original curse. The
effects of this are up to the DM.
The material components are the holy symbol of the priest plus one item which
carries  a significant symbolic opponent to the curse per level of the  curse
creator. As the opposing level is not known, one should have lots of stuff to
ensure that enough items are there. For each item that is lacking during  the
casting,  the caster of this spell has to save versus death magic (at  normal
saving  throws); any failed saving throws indicate that the curse  sucked  in
the priest; any levels the priest had are now added to the level of curses in
the  item or area. The significant items are destroyed one by one per  failed
saving  throw  of the curse creator. These items can be supplied  during  the
casting by helpers.
The  reverse, instill curse, creates a very strong curse which can be  placed
in  an item or on an area. If it is placed within an item, the item gains the
power  to  force the wielder to commit suicidal acts, to become  a  homicidal
maniac,  or  something the like (all subject to a saving throw  versus  spell
each  time the item is touched or thrice per round if continuous touch). Such
items  can resist the effect of break curse as if they used the normal saving
throws of the curse caster at the time the caster cast this spell.
The reversed spell requires the priest's holy symbol, a significant amount of
solidified  hatred  (about  a teaspoon full), a huge  amount  of  disgust  (a
wineskin full), and a large sack of desire to harm.

The  recipient of a breath silt spell is able to breathe silt freely for  the
duration  of the spell (this ability does not interfere with the  ability  to
breathe normal air). The priest can divide the base duration between multiple
characters. Thus, a 10th-level priest can confer this ability to 2 characters
for  5  hours each, to 5 characters for 2 hours each, etc., to a  minimum  of
half an hour per character.
As  this spell allows the recipient to breathe silt and air, it will not only
protect against choking in a silt storm but also against total submersion  in
the  Sea  of  Silt. This spell will not protect against submersion  in  sand,
water,  or  any other material; nor will it protect against noxious  vapours,
such as poisonous clouds or smoke.

This  spell causes the affected area to have breathable air for the  duration
of  the  spell, as long as the surrounding pressure will allow  it  (eg.,  in
shallow water the pressure will not remove the spell, in deep water the water
pressure will reduce the area of effect considerably).
This  is  handy  for emergency breathing supplies within a poison  gas  area,
stinking  cloud,  etc.,  and also gives a better saving  throw  versus  these
effects  (save at +4). The reverse (unbreathable air) will cause the  air  to
become totally unbreathable, causing choking (1d6 per round while within  the
area of effect) and making it difficult to cast spells (save versus spell  to
be able to do so). This is similar to stinking cloud.

This  spell causes any changes in the creature by speed plant growth or speed
animal  growth to become a normal feature in the animal's or plant's species.
This  animal  or plant is then considered a normal animal or plant  for  most
purposes  of  other spells   with the exception of further uses of  the  said
spells.
The material component is greater mistletoe cut freshly from a tree, which is
cut by a platinum sickle never before used by anyone. The mistletoe has to be
caught  in  a  bowl  made  from the living leaves of  an  oak.  All  material
components vanish at the casting of this spell. The priest offers part of his
life  to stabilise the effect of the size increase or decrease; thus he loses
a  Constitution  point  in  addition  to the  platinum  sickle,  the  greater
mistletoe and the bowl.

With  this  spell,  the caster causes any type of stone (sandstone,  granite,
etc.)  to  become extremely brittle and easily broken; so much so,  that  the
stone  may be crumbled by hand like pottery. When cast against normal  stone,
no  saving  throw is allowed, and the caster affects up to 2  cubic  foot  of
stone  for every level of experience. The priest may shape the spell  to  any
dimensions, as long as no dimension is less than 1 foot and the area does not
exceed the allowable amount. For example, at eighth level, Krystan can affect
up  to 16 cubic feet of stone; she might create a shallow hole in a door 4  4
1,  or create a narrow tunnel 1 1 16. Stone doors and walls thinner than  the
area  of  effect  may  easily be kicked through    treat  as  thin  wood  for
structural saving throws. When used to tunnel through underground  rock,  the
DM must determine the likelihood of cave in.
When  this spell is cast against inanimate stone that was magically  created,
such  as  that  created by a wall of stone spell, treat as if a dispel  magic
spell  was  cast  on  the stone. If the dispelling fails, the  stone  remains
intact.  If  the  dispelling  succeeds, the  brittle  stone  spell  functions
normally  (note:  this  spell  does not dispel  the  stone,  simply  make  it
brittle).
If  cast  against  a  creature made entirely of stone, such  as  a  stone  or
obsidian  golem  (but  not  rock golems, which are  immune  to  transmutation
spells),  the creature is allowed a saving throw versus spell in addition  to
any innate magic resistance. If it fails both, it suffers a +4 penalty to its
Armour Class for the number of rounds equal to the caster's level. If cast in
this  manner, brittle stone can only affect one creature, regardless  of  the
spell's area of effect or the creature's size.
The material components are two fist-sized stones from the bed of a stream or
river.  The  caster holds a stone in each hand and claps them together  while
casting the spell.

The  Magic  of Nilrem is a series of humorous spells made in AD&D 2nd-edition
format.  They aren't intended for game use, but if a DM has a real  sense  of
humour,  pertinent  game information is included. The following  spell  is  a
special  one created by Nilrem on a day similar to our Valentine's Day  which
he (unsuccessfully) cast on a woman he desired.
This  is  one  of  the  more unusual spells created by Nilrem.  When  casted,
several  magical  missiles are evoked and travel at  a  medium  pace  to  the
intended target. The missiles seeks out the target, turning corners,  dodging
bystanders, and other such complicated manoeuvres. If the target is struck by
at  least  one of the missiles, or fails a saving throw versus petrification,
the  spell takes effect. The missiles do not harm the affected creature, only
deliver  the  magic. The actual effect of the spell is to effectively  "break
the  heart"  of  the creature causing extreme misery and coldness  to  others
around  it. An additional effect, the one Nilrem originally intended,  is  to
end  any  feelings of love the creature has towards anyone else and  to  even
lose partial memory of such partners.
The  results  of  the use of this spell can be quite strange and  not  always
follow  the above description exactly. Nilrem's na<ve intention was to  sever
his target's relations with her fianc,e and then move in on her himself. What
he  didn't realise was that, as an additional effect of the spell, the  woman
had developed a callousness towards all imposing men and so she rejected him.
The  only  way the effects of this spell can be removed is with  the  spell's
reverse,  mended heart, which Nilrem attempted to cast on his love, but  when
he  did so she regained her senses (and her memory) she scorned him for  what
he  did and went out in search of her former lover. The material component of
this  spell is a jewel or piece of gold shaped like a heart which is  snapped
in two upon the casting of the spell.
The  material  components of the reverse are the original,  resulting  pieces
which must be placed together upon casting and fuse together if the spell  is
successful.

A  witch  uses this spell to enchant her broom with the power of flight.  The
broom  flies  with  a movement rate of 30, minus 1 per 14  pounds  above  182
pounds which it is carrying, and it can climb and turn at an angle of  30  in
response to the verbal command of its mistress. While the enchantment  lasts,
the  witch  can  summon  the broom from up to 300 yards  away.  The  material
components  are a broom, which is not used up by the casting, and a  feather,
which is. The long casting time is necessary to set the command words, but if
the  spell is recast on an already enchanted broom, it has a casting time  of
3.

Upon  casting this spell, the wizard fills the area with bubbles. The  sphere
of  bubbles is so thick and active that it seriously restricts vision, giving
all  within  it  a  -4 to-hit. The action of the bubbles  will  also  disrupt
spellcasting unless the caster makes a Constitution check. The caster is  not
immune  to  the  effects of the spell, and will suffer the same restrictions.
Most sea life will avoid the sphere of bubbles when possible.

The  material component of this spell is a small tube, which the caster blows
bubbles through while casting.

As  a  wizard who enjoyed fermenting his own brews, Bucca was totally unaware
of  the odour of his own creations. Sam, as he was known to his friends, grew
tired of complaints from his friends about the rank smell of his breath after
taste  testing  his  own brews. He designed this spell  (popularly  known  as
Bucca's  Beery Breath) to make use of his foul exhalations, in the hope  that
his friends would stop complaining.
In  the  casting  of  this  spell,  the wizard  must  consume  at  least  100
millilitres of an alcoholic beverage (the material component), the potency of
which determines the efficiency of the spell (see below).
In  addition  to drinking the alcohol, the caster leans forward  and  belches
loudly and from his mouth issues a stream of putrid breath, which expands  to
fill  a  cloud of a 10-foot radius. All within the cloud must make  a  saving
throw  versus  breath  weapon  or suffer 2d4  points  of  damage  (1d4  if  a
successful  saving throw is made) and the special effects  listed  below  (or
none,  if  a  successful saving throw is made). The cloud swiftly dissipates,
and  is  gone  within    round  of its creation. All  effects  of  the  spell
including drunkenness pass within 1 hour.

Stinging  eyes,  coughing has little effect beyond a -3  penalty  to  missile
fire.  Retching means that any characters affected are delayed  in  attacking
for  half a round. Disorientation indicates the onset of drunkenness, if  the
character  is  left  alone at the end of the period of  drunkenness  he  will
resume  previous activities, if attacked, the character may respond in  kind,
with  a  -1  to attack rolls. Slight drunkenness means that the character  is
confused, no dextrous activities allowed, and a -2 to attack rolls.  Sickness
and  mild  drunkenness indicates that the character does not want to  eat  or
drink  for 1d12 hours, has a -2 to attack rolls, and inflicts -1 damage (with
a  minimum  of 1). Severe drunkenness denotes that the character  is  totally
befuddled,  has  a  -5  to attack rolls, inflicts -3 damage  (again,  with  a
minimum of 1), and can barely walk in a straight line.
Note  that  the effects of drunkenness are different then those  in  the  Net
Alcohol Guide. Because the effects are caused by magic, they are based on the
Bucca's interpretation of alcohol and what he wanted the spell to accomplish.

      The  wizard creates a number of small bugs equal to his level.  In  the
illusionist's  case, these bugs are only illusionary, but with the  conjurer,
they  are  real.  If  they are made to appear within  the  pockets  (or  open
orifice)  of an individual, a saving throw versus spell may apply  to  negate
the cantrip's effects.

When  the  wizard casts this spell, flames shoot out of his hand  (he  has  a
choice  of  using  one  or both of his hands). This  spell  is  meant  to  be
versatile  and as such it also allows one to still use a throwing  weapon  if
the  character has a Dexterity of 18 and uses only one hand for  the  casting
(anything  less than 18 receives a penalty to the to-hit roll  equal  to  its
difference  with  18;  18 only hits on a normal roll with  no  bonuses).  The
damage is 1d4+2 HP for each level of experience.
Creatures  who make their saving throw versus spell receive only half  damage
from the spell but can still be nailed by the thrown weapon.

This  spell holds up to four humanoid creatures completely immobile for  five
or  more  rounds.  Bushwack  affects any humanoid  of  man-sized  or  smaller
including;  brownies,  dryads, dwarves, elves,  gnolls,  hobgoblins,  nixies,
troglodytes and others.
The  spell  is  centred  on a point selected by the caster  and  brings  into
existence sturdy vines which spring from the floor (or mid-air if no  surface
is  within the area of effect) and attempt to wrap the target creature  in  a
cocoon-like entrapment. If the spell is cast at three or four creatures, each
gets  an  unmodified saving throw. If only two creatures are  targeted,  each
makes  its saving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell is cast at  only  one
creature,  the  saving  throw suffers a -3 penalty. Those  creatures  failing
their saving throws are unaffected by the spell.
Creatures  failing  their  saving throws are fully enwrapped  in  the  vines,
whisked  off their feet and held upside down approximately one foot  off  the
ground. Held beings may not move nor speak, nor may they see or hear what  is
happening  around them. The held creatures may be freed if the vines  sustain
damage equal to one half the caster's total hit points but any damage applied
to the vines is equally applied to creatures held within them.
The  caster  may  end  the spell with a single utterance  at  any  time.  The
material component for this spell is a piece of creeping ivy.

Several  decades past, Byen, the famed assassin/illusionist of  the  City  of
Yorkad,   created   this  spell  so  as  to  be  able  to   execute   certain
"assassinations"  which would seem completely real but in  which  the  victim
would  (hopefully)  not  be  killed. Byen's arrow  creates  a  very  powerful
illusion that is modelled exactly after an actual arrow. The wizard must take
a  real  arrow  (the material component of the spell), of fine  quality,  and
spend  one entire round chanting and weaving his hands along the edge of  the
arrow.  To  complete the casting, the wizard must prick  his  finger  with  a
splinter  of wood and smear it upon the arrowhead. The arrow is then actually
replaced by an illusion, that has full visual, audible, tactile, thermal, and
olfactory  components. An attempt to disbelieve can be made, but  the  saving
throw  is  made at -2 (or +2 if informed of the illusion); however,  in  most
circumstances,  there  will be no reason to suspect anything  is  amiss.  The
wizard  can  "enchant" up to 1 arrow for every two levels he possesses,  each
arrow taking one round of preparation.
The  arrows  must  be  shot in a normal manner (i.e., the  wizard  must  have
someone of a class able to make use make use of a bow to shoot them). Such  a
user  will  in  no  way  suspect that the arrows are  illusionary  from  just
examining them. If these arrows hit a target, the illusion continues so  that
the  target  will  bleed  illusionary blood, an will feel  illusionary  pain.
Unless  the  victim for some reason attempted to disbelieve and this  attempt
was  successful, the victim will take the full 1d6 points of damage from  the
arrow, plus any applicable bonuses for Strength, specialisation, a magic bow,
etc.  Only  25%  of this damage is actual, but even after the illusion  fades
(which  happens in 5 rounds + 1 round per level after being hit)  the  victim
will  still  suffer  from shock and a loss in confidence and  composure.  Hit
points lost because of these arrows that were not part of actual damage  will
be  recovered  at a rate of 1 HP per round of rest or 1 HP per turn  of  mild
activity, but not at all for strenuous activity. Creatures brought below zero
hit  point  because of this illusionary damage will be unconscious  and  must
make a system shock survival roll of else die of shock, losing 1 HP per round
until  reaching -10, unless they receive aid. Even creatures that can be  hit
by  only  by silver, iron or magical weapons will suffer from all  the  above
effects unless they have some special resistance to illusions (or have reason
to be suspicious and disbelieve).
Note  that Byen's arrow will work on light and heavy quarrels of high quality
as well as on arrows.

This  spell is not for the animal lovers out there. For the rest of you: sick
of  that  toad you got stuck with for a familiar? Bored with your  skunk  (he
never was very good for parties)? Now there is Byrnaal's apologetic release!
This  spell releases any creature from a find familiar spell with no  adverse
effects  to  either  the animal or the caster. It causes the  ex-familiar  to
return  to  the  exact state it was in before bound as a  familiar:  in  age,
memories,  etc.  Not appropriate for very serious campaigns,  but  there  are
times when this spell could have a serious, beneficial use in a campaign (for
instance,  the wizard is a wild magician and rolls that evil wild surge  that
gives him an assassin imp as a familiar).
Byrnall Magefyre was the very first character I ever created, and still going
strong (when he's not too busy fighting off Cyric, the Night Parade, the Cult
of the Dragon, Orcus, and the Second Unhuman war on Toril).

This  spell reduces the magic resistance of any creature by 2d10%  +  1%  per
level.  A  successful saving throw reduces this loss to half (round up),  but
the creature's magic resistance has no effect on this spell.
The  somatic component consists of merely pointing at the target. The  verbal
component  is  this:  the caster must utter three truths  about  the  target.
Depending  on  how well this is roleplayed, the DM should give  saving  throw
bonuses  or penalties, or change the amount by which the magic resistance  is
lowered.
Note: This spell was made three years before the Tome of Magic containing the
5th-level  lower resistance spell came out, so seniority is  claimed  by  the
original poster.

This  perilous exercise in dweomercraft summons up a powerful tanar'ri -  any
true tanar'ri, depending upon the fiend's name known to the wizard. Note that
this  spell is not of sufficient power to bring a tanar'ri of greater  power,
and  lesser  sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any  event,
the  spell  caster  must know the name of the fiend he is summoning.  As  the
spell  name implies, the fiend so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed.
The  spell  caster must be within a circle of protection (or  a  thaumaturgic
triangle  with  protection  from evil) and the  tanar'ri  confined  within  a
circled  pentagram,  if  he is to avoid being slain or  carried  off  by  the
summoned fiend. The summoned fiend can be treated with as follows:
           The wizard can require the monster to perform a desired course  of
action  by  force  of  threat and pain of a spiritwrack (or  similar)  spell,
allowing  freedom whenever the fiend performs the full extent of the service,
and  forcing  the  fiend  to pledge its word upon  it.  This  is  exceedingly
dangerous,  as  a minor error in such a bargain will be seized  upon  by  the
monster  to  reverse  the desired outcome or simply to kill  and  devour  the
summoner.  Furthermore,  the  fiend will bear great  enmity  for  the  wizard
forever  after  such  force  obedience, so the spell  caster  had  better  be
prepared and powerful.
           By  tribute  of fresh human blood and the promise of one  or  more
human  sacrifices,  the  summoner can bargain  with  the  fiend  for  willing
service. Again, the spell caster is well advised to have ample protection and
power  to  defend  himself,  as the fiend might  decide  that  the  offer  is
insufficient  -  and it is easier to enjoy the summoner's slow  death  -  and
decide not the accept the bargain as offered. Although the fiend will have to
abide  by  a pledge, as its name is known, it will have to hold only  to  the
exact wording of the arrangement, not to the spirit of the agreement. On  the
other  hand, only highly evil wizards are likely to attempt to strike such  a
bargain, and the summoned fiend might be favourably disposed towards  such  a
character, especially if he is also chaotic.
           The  summoned fiend can be the object of a trap the soul. In  this
case,  the  wizard  will not speak with or bargain for the fiend's  services,
although  the fiend might be eager to reach an accord with the wizard  before
it  is  forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the fiend is risky only  if
proper  precautions have not been taken, for failure to confine  the  monster
usually  means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped,
the  fiend must remained imprisoned until the possessor of his object  breaks
it,  and  this  requires  one  service from the now  freed  monster.  If  the
individual freeing the fiend fails to demand a service when the monster  asks
what  is  required of him, the fiend is under no constraint not to  slay  the
liberator on the spot, but if a service is required, the creature must  first
do its best to perform it, and then return to the Abyss.
The  duration  of service of any fiend must be limited unless  the  fiend  is
willing  to  serve for an extended period. Any required course of  action  or
service  which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to  perform,
or  is  impossible  to  perform, is 50% likely to free  the  fiend  from  its
obligations  and  enable  it to be unconstrained in its  vengeance  upon  the
wizard  if he is not thereafter continually protected, for a fiend  so  freed
can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days.
The  fiend summoned by this spell will be exceptionally strong (8 hit  points
per Hit Die), due to the magical processes involved in the summoning.
Casting  time  is  half an hour per Hit Die of the fiend.  If  there  is  any
interruption during this period, the spell fails. If there is an interruption
while  the  fiend  is summoned, it is 10% probable that it will  be  able  to
escape   its  boundaries  and  attack  the  wizard,  this  percentage  rising
cumulatively each round of continued interruption.
Each  fiend is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell.  If  a
score  higher than the level of the wizard summoning is rolled with 3d6  (4d6
for  balors), that particular spell failed to bring the desired fiend.   When
this  occurs, it is certain that the named fiend is imprisoned or  destroyed,
or  the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have to
call upon another name to bring forth a fiend.
The components of this spell are five flaming black candles; a brazier of hot
coals  upon  which must be burned sulphur, bat hairs, lard,  soot,  mercuric-
nitric  acid crystals, mandrake root, alcohol, and a piece of parchment  with
the  fiend's name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish  of  blood
from some mammal (preferably a human, or course) placed inside the area where
the fiend is to be held.

This  terrible  spell  allows the wizard to drain the youth  from  a  victim,
revitalising  himself, at the expense of ageing the victim.  Hardly  a  spell
used by good aligned wizards.
The  wizard  first prepares the spell, by casting the eight phase portion  of
it.  He  then  has his level in rounds to make contact with the  victim,  and
begin  draining.  To drain the youth of the victim, the  wizard  must  be  in
continuous contact with the flesh of the victim during the draining  process.
The  act  of  being  drained  is extremely painful  to  the  victim,  and  is
sufficient to awaken sleeping victims, and allow charmed victims a new saving
throw.  Even if the victim is conscious, however, the draining will continue.
The victim must break flesh contact with the wizard to break the spell.
The  wizard is able to drain a decade, plus one decade for every four  levels
above  first  he  possesses,  i.e. 20 years at fifth,  30  at  ninth,  40  at
thirteenth, etc. Each year takes but a tenth of a round to drain, so a decade
is  drained per round. If the spell is broken during casting, the wizard will
still  have  drained  a  number of years dependent on time  of  casting  (eg.
contact broken after 2 rounds, 20 years drained). Due to the imperfect nature
of  the  spell, however, the wizard only reduces in age by a year  for  every
three drained from the victim.
Both wizard and victim will be affected by the change in age. The victim will
only  suffer  the  disadvantages of ageing (Strength and Constitution  loss),
whereas   the  wizard  will  only  experience  the  benefits  (Strength   and
Constitution gain). After the spell, the victim will have visibly aged,  with
greying  hair,  and  lined, shaggy skin. The wizard will appear  invigorated,
with  grey disappearing from his hair, and the obvious return of muscle tone.
The  victim must save versus paralysation, or fall unconscious for 1d4 turns,
if  he  is drained more than 20 years. The wizard will experience a temporary
1d4  increase in Strength (not including that gained from becoming  younger),
which  will fade by 1 point a turn. The wizard will also feel inebriated,  an
effect which persists for 1d6 rounds.
This  spell is only effective on humans. Long lived races, such as elves  and
dwarves, as well as humanoid races, are immune from the spell, and the wizard
must  save  versus paralysation, or be knocked unconscious if  attempting  to
drain a member of these races.
Finally,  there  is no known cure for this spell, save a wish.  The  material
component  of  this spell is a scrap of flesh from a vampire, which  must  be
consumed by the wizard.

This  spell  functions, in all respects, as the 3rd-level priest  spell  call
lightning,  except  in the following regards: each bolt of  called  lightning
functions exactly as the 6th-level wizard spell chain lightning.
This spell should be one of greatest scarcity and secrecy. It would be sought
by  any lord looking toward world domination and would not be given or traded
for  other  spells.  Allegedly created by the long missing  Lich  Vecna,  the
incantation has surfaced three more times since his mad bid for supremacy. On
each occasion of its surfacing, it was used in such a way as to call down the
wrath  of  a  certain  Lord of the Elements, Zeus, from whom  the  spell  was
stolen.  To  date, no wizard has successfully called upon this power  without
having his soul destroyed by the greatest of the Olympians. Perhaps you  will
be the first to escape this fate. Probably not...

This  spell summons forth a dragon of the highest Hit Die type, depending  on
die  roll (see below). The spell gives the caster no control over the actions
of the dragon. Sanctuary will not work. A die is rolled to determine the type
of dragon:

     D8 Roll   Dragon Type
     1    gold dragon
     2-3  silver dragon
     4-5  black dragon
     6-7  blue dragon
     8    red dragon

The  saving throw is modified by one up or down per 2 HD of the dragon  above
or  below  15.  The  material component of this spell is a miniature  dragon,
crafted from the finest materials, worth at least 10,000 gp.

This  power is a special variation of the telekinesis science very
similar to ballistic attack devotion. Instead of moving any object
relatively  slowly, Call Object allows the character  to  move  an
object to her hand very fast.
      The  object,  no more than 2 pound in weight, "fly"  to  the
psionicist hand very fast without warming the psionicist. It  must
be  within  sight  of  the psionicist and cannot  be  anchored  or
attached to anything else.
      Reference: Luke getting his lightsaber in The Empire Strikes
Back.

Power Score:  No other effect.

20:  Ballistic boomerang. The psionicist receive 1d6 of damage  as
the  object  hits  herself. The same as to  be  the  target  of  a
ballistic attack.

      This  spell  lights  small fires easily, and  ignites  anything  up  to
kindling  (cloth, kindling wood, oil, etc.). The caster points at the  target
materials  and  mutters "Fire" in an arcane tongue. If cast directly  on  the
clothing  or hair of a person, it does 1d2 points of damage each round  until
put  out. A particularly fun use of this spell (and one the lady-like Katrine
would never consider) is to light the rope someone else is climbing.

This  spell  creates  an  extradimensional  space  -  an  improved  form   of
Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion. It literally duplicates a  small,  closed
section  of the wizard's plane, creating a temporary new demiplane. The  area
of  effect is a base 1 square kilometre per level of the wizard. The duration
is a base 2 hours per level, modified as below:
           Each  1  square  kilometre added to the base  amount  lessens  the
duration of the spell by 2 hours.
           Each  1  square  kilometre subtracted  from  the  area  of  effect
increases the duration by 3 hours.
The wizard can modify the terrain and plant features to a limited extent when
closing  off the area. The land, animals, structures, etc. are duplicated  in
the new planar space with the following restrictions:
          No magic items or magically protected structures are duplicated.
          Creatures of Intelligence greater than 2 cannot be duplicated.

Unlike the 8th-level permanency, cantrip permanency must be cast on an object
to  be effective. The object must be appropriate to the cantrip - eg. a cloth
for  polish, a paintbrush for colour, a salt cellar for salt. When  complete,
the  duration  of the cantrip (or the number of times it may be  invoked)  is
increased dramatically. There are two ways the spell may be used.
Method 1: 1. cantrip, 2. cantrip permanency.
Method 2: 1. enchant an item, 2. cantrip, 3. cantrip permanency.
If  method  1  is  used, the duration of the cantrip is  increased  to  1d8+4
months.  In  the  second case, the cantrip is completely  permanent.  If  the
cantrip  is one that does not have a duration per se (eg. clean, exterminate,
polish), then the power of the cantrip may be invoked from the item a maximum
of once per hour.

This  spell in many respects duplicates the effects of the 2nd-level stinking
cloud.  Except  where  noted, this spell duplicates the effects  of  stinking
cloud.
It  has a slightly longer casting time and a duration which is shorter by one
round,  but it has the advantage of lacking a verbal component: the  material
components are waved in the air and the spell's gestures made, but  otherwise
the  spell  is utterly silent. It produces a thin grey cloud of vapour  which
reeks of rotting flesh and the odours of the tomb.

The material component for this spell is a bit of zombie or ghoul flesh or  a
small  strip  of carrion crawler hide. If ghast flesh is substituted,  saving
throws versus this spell are -1.

The  caster uses a knife or dagger or other suitable tool to carve a  special
protective  symbol  on one useful item made of metal or stone  (a  weapon,  a
coin, a suit of armour, etc.). The item cannot be smaller than a coin.
The item becomes magical and possess the ability to protect the one who holds
and  uses it. It will confer a +3 bonus to his saving throws for a number  of
times  equal  to half the caster's level. The person can choose when  to  use
this ability, but this must be announced before the die roll.
The  material  component is the item, which disappears after  the  spell  has
expired. It must have some value to the character at the time of the casting;
an  ordinary  piece  of rock or wood, for example, cannot  be  used,  but  an
obsidian dagger can.
Due to the link between the person and the item, no-one else can use it. This
spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

      Cat  spirit grants many of the abilities traditionally associated  with
cats,  though it does not significantly alter the features of the  recipient.
The  spell  grants a +2 bonus to stealth, as the recipient's  tread  will  be
absolutely  quiet  for the duration. The spell also halves all  damage  taken
from  falls and allows the recipient to land on his feet. Finally, it  grants
the ability to grow claws, allowing each hand to do 1d3 points of damage.  It
does  not,  however,  improve  singing ability.  The  material  component  is
whiskers from a cat.

With  this spell, the wizard can determine if the corpse has received  damage
from  any  of the causes listed in the table below, and which cause  actually
reduced him to zero hit points. This spell involves dissection of the corpse,
and  the  material components are a magnifying glass and a set  of  scalpels.
These are not expended by the casting.

Cause     Notes and Secondary Information
Exposure  exposure to cold, fire, heat, or lightning; drowning
Falling or hanging  height fallen from
Disease or old age  organs affected, parasites involved
Magic     applies only to magic missile or necromantic effects
Wound     wound inflicted by bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing

The  DM  may introduce a chance of failure if the body is greatly decomposed,
and  he  might give false information based on nature of the trauma. A corpse
swatted  by a dragon's tail, for example, might show the same indications  as
one  which fell from a great height, and a poisoned corpse usually looks like
one  which died of disease. The prudent wizard always detects poison just  to
be sure.

#9#
This  spell was created by Celestarion to be his ultimate form of protection.
Whether  it is or is not is left up to the individual wizard, but nonetheless
it is a powerful spell.
When cast, a sphere of swirling black and white light appears to surround the
wizard  and  all  those close to him. The barrier has all  of  the  following
effects:
           It  prevents any spells going through it. What happens is that the
spell energy is drawn into the top of the sphere.
           The  lighting  effects of the sphere prevent  anyone  from  seeing
through it, although those on the inside can see out. This results in a -4 to-
hit penalty.
           All  magic within the sphere is unaffected. Spells cannot be  cast
out of it, but can be cast within it.
           No  living being can pass through the sphere unless a saving throw
versus spell is made with a -6 penalty. If they fail their saving throw, they
are simply unable to pass through.
          No magic items of any sort can pass through.
          Normal physical objects can pass through, as can psionic attacks.
          If the barrier is not hit by a spell or a magic item or any psionic
discipline,  then the barrier needs energy. It draws 2d4 of the wizard's  hit
points  for every round that it isn't hit. Should the wizard's hit points  go
below  10% of their maximum, he starts to lose one level per round. The spell
continues  for as long as his initial level in rounds. When he has lost  half
his  levels, then he starts to lose 1 Intelligence point per round until  the
spell ends.
          The wizard cannot voluntarily end the spell.
Hit  point and level losses are temporary and return at the rate of  one  per
turn  each,  but  Intelligence losses are permanent.  These  effects  can  be
avoided if the wizard himself casts a spell at the barrier. He cannot  dispel
it when he wishes, however.

The  material components of this spell are one star sapphire, and  one  black
star opal of at least 20,000 gp value each. Both are lost in the casting.

This spell was designed as a last line of defense by Celestarion for use when
all  else  failed.  It  is  nothing less than a 9th-level  blast  of  totally
destructive  energy.  Upon  casting, the  following  things  happen,  in  the
sequence given.
      1.   A blast of scintillating energy erupts from the wizard's hands and
strikes the target.
      2.    The  target has to make a saving throw versus spell at  -6.  This
spell also causes magic resistance rolls to be made at -30%.
     3.   Failure of the saving throw totally disintegrates the target.
      4.   Success of the saving throw means the target takes 10d20 points of
damage and, if still alive, is stunned for 1d4 turns.
      5.    The wizard, regardless of spell effects, automatically loses  one
level  permanently,  and  must  make a saving  throw  versus  spell.  Failure
indicates  instant  death, with only a wish being able  to  bring  him  back.
Success  results  in  losing 1d100 of his remaining  spell  levels,  randomly
chosen, and being unconscious for 1d4 rounds.

The  material component of this spell is an ioun stone, which is lost in  the
casting.

This  spell is designed to ward off undead creatures and creatures  from  the
lower planes. When cast, all such creatures within 10 feet of the wizard  are
subject to a saving throw versus spell at -5, taking into account their magic
resistance. Those failing their saving throw are thrown out of the area by  a
tremendous  force,  and land 20 feet away. Thereafter, the  creatures  cannot
enter  the sphere, or use their powers on creatures within the sphere. Spells
and attacks can still be cast at these foul creatures from within the sphere.

The  material  component of this spell is a glass ball or a  marble  made  of
crystal.

following list:

     Wizard's Level Centipedes Summoned
     3-4  huge (« HD)

     This power allows a dreamer to alter their physical self in a
manner similar to certain spells.  A level 1 it is equivalent to a
change self spell.  At level 5, 2 dream statistic points are added
to  the  amount  to be distributed.  At level 7, this  psionic  is
equivalent  to  a  polymorph self spell.   At  level  9,  5  dream
statistic points can be added.  At level 15, this total  rises  to
10.   At  level 20, this power is similar to a shape change  spell
except  that body parts can change by themselves without the  rest
of  the body being affected.  The number of dream statistic points
is raised to 15.

Power Score:  Move up to the next level of mastery (i.e. 1st level
to 5th level, 5th level to 7th level, etc.)

20:   The dreamer succeeds, but at one level of mastery lower  and
attracts the attention of a Dream Demon (q.v.)

This  spell  creates  a  real change in a creature. Hit  points,  statistics,
personality,  the whole works can be changed. Even the race of the  character
can  be modified. The caster must be 15 levels above the creature. This spell
can  be  used  with  resurrection  to  resurrect  a  creature  with  no  more
Constitution points, but finding the help of a wizard 15 levels above you can
be tricky!
A  mortal caster loses one Constitution point, permanently. If caster fails a
Wisdom  check, the caster's hit points drop to zero and he falls unconscious.
Else, the caster takes half damage. A demigod caster must roll 1d20; on a 20,
he  takes  half damage, otherwise, he takes none. Full deities are immune  to
any harmful effects.

      The  victim of this spell receives a saving throw to avoid the  effect,
with  any  adjustment due to Wisdom. If the person receives damage  from  the
caster's group in the same round the spell is cast, an additional bonus of +1
per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw.

      If  the victim fails his saving throw, his sexual preference is changed
to the opposite. Thus a man who liked women would now prefer other men.

      The  duration  of  the  spell is a function  of  the  charmed  person's
Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be  broken  if  a
successful  saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw  is  checked  on  a
periodic  basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the  following
table).

This  spell is used to recharge any item which was initially created  by  the
use  of  an enchant an item spell, such as magical rings, gems, rods, staves,
and wands; but not limited to such.
The  wizard must be fully rested and not engaged in any physical activity  to
cast  this  spell. Usually, most wizards try to find a secure area since  the
result  of  spell failure can be deadly. He first cast this  spell  over  the
item,  in the process opening up a channel between him and the magic item  to
be  recharged,  taking one round to initiate the channel. At this  time,  the
total  possible  charges  an item may contain may  be  discerned  by  casting
identify at this time with a modifier of +10% added onto his normal chance of
success.  Then, the appropriate spells must be cast into the  item  to  bring
about its recharging. While the spells needed for various items are too large
to  be listed, it can be assumed that a spell which the item imitates is able
to  recharge  the item (spell research can aid in gaining more  knowledge  of
subject).
At  the  end  of  the recharging session (or at least before the  channelling
effect ends due to the casting time limitations) the wizard must "close"  the
item's channel. This requires a successful saving throw versus spell modified
by +1 for every level of the wizard and -1 for every spell cast into the item
which  did nothing to recharge it. A failed saving throw means that  none  of
the  spells  cast into the item had any recharging affect. If the  wizard  is
physically  attacked or the spell disrupted during the recharging period  the
wizard  must make an unmodified successful saving throw versus spell, with  a
successful  saving throw indicating the entire process has been  merely  cast
for  naught and a failed saving throw indicating that the magic item explodes
for  a magical blast effect in a 10- to 60-foot radius doing damage equal  to
1d4  points  of  damage per charge the item currently contains  (save  versus
spell  for  half damage). The item in question (unless of artifact  or  relic
status)  is  irrevocably ruined in the explosion. The material  component  of
this  spell  is  a  small gold funnel worth at least 100 gp value,  which  is
destroyed in the casting of the spell.
The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

This  spell  is similar to the 4th-level chaos vision. However,  rather  than
producing  an illusion as chaos vision does, this spell produces a very  real
effect.  The  ground crolls and twists, and objects from  the  wizard's  mind
appear and disappear.
All   creatures   and  objects  in  the  chaos  environment  are   constantly
polymorphing, once each round. Note that creatures polymorphed will  need  to
save versus spell each round to keep their former identity and not take on  a
new one. All creatures and objects will polymorph back to their original form
upon leaving the area of effect.
A person entering this environment had best carried nothing with him or risks
losing  it  as he turns into some form which might not be able to  carry  it.
People have to make system shock rolls every turn, for the stresses will tear
even the mightiest hero apart, given time.
All  damage from being crushed, attacked, and otherwise affected by the spell
is  real, caused by real creatures and environmental changes in the  area.  A
general  rule  of  thumb  for damage caused by the constant  changes  in  the
environment  is  1d6  hit points per round. However, DMs  are  encouraged  to
devise specific environmental changes, and apply damage as appropriate.

The  material  component  of  this spell is a wild  magic  region,  which  is
consumed by the spell. The area of effect fills the area previously formed by
the  wild  magic area. The duration of the chaos environment is the  duration
remaining on the wildzone which created the wild magic region used.

This spell offers some protection from teleport spells by constantly shifting
and  shaping  what an area looks like. Thus, a wizard cannot use  information
gathered previously to teleport to the affected area as the surroundings will
have  seemingly changed. Objects located in this environment or  entering  it
will  be  affected as well, first appearing as one object or animal and  then
shifting to another.
Another  use  found  for this spell is as a trap. Slimes,  moulds  and  other
creatures  that don't need senses to attack can be placed in this environment
and  are effectively invisible. Any attacks on anything in the area of effect
is hindered by a -4 modifier to-hit.
Note  that  true  seeing and similar spells that see through  illusions  will
likewise  penetrate this one. The illusion itself will not cause any  damage,
although  it  may  cause  characters to react  in  such  a  way  as  to  hurt
themselves. The main purpose of this spell is simply to constantly conceal.

This  spell  affects any single male it is cast upon. Males  include  humans,
demihumans,  or  humanoids. Any charm-resistant creatures are still  affected
because seducer magic affects the sexual part of the brain, which is not well
protected in males, even elves.
The  target  receives a saving throw versus spell to avoid the effects,  with
any  adjustments  due  to  Wisdom. See the Player's Handbook  for  a  further

Charm of healing allows a wizard to convince the recipient of the spell  that
they  have been cured of some damage. The spell "heals" 1d4 points of  damage
plus an additional point for every three levels of the wizard, this curing is
in  fact illusionary and only lasts for the duration of the spell. Note where
the  recipient  of this spell has suffered illusionary damage  then  the  hit
points recovered are permanent (i.e., equivalent to priestly cure spells).

The material components for this spell are a piece of coral, a bandage and  a
few drops of pure spring water.

This  spell compels the affected creature to abstain completely from any  and
all  forms  of  sexual  activity, including looking appreciatively  but  with
sexual  undertones,  going to whatever lengths necessary  to  avoid  anything
which  might lead to lust. The reverse, promiscuity, compels the subjects  to
attempt  to engage in their most preferred sexual activities as much  and  as
quickly  as possible. The material component of this spell is a small  silver
key.

This  spell is similar to Cheffield's major feast except that it brings  into
existence  food  and drink which is of extremely high quality.  The  food  is
excellent and nourishing. The drink is rich and tasty. This meal is truly fit
for a king and his kind. In addition to the main meal are appetizers to serve
before  and  desserts to be eaten afterwards. Nobody who is being  served  by
this spell will be unable to finish their food.

The  material  components of this spell are rich spices (40 gp)  and  a  good
quality  wine (minimum 10 gp) which must be mixed together when the spell  is
cast.  As a final note it must be pointed out that the four and twenty  black
birds baked in a pie is an optional feature.

When  this  spell is cast into a large pot or onto an appropriate  number  of
plates  it brings into being enough food to feed four per level of the wizard
for  one  meal.  The food is nourishing and filling, the drink  is  cool  and
refreshing.  The  food may not taste the best in the world but  it  certainly
fills  the  cracks.  It  also makes, when chilled and  rewarmed,  exceptional
leftovers.
This  spell requires a handful of rice which is cooked over a low boil  while
the wizard mutters "cooks in just 5 minutes".
The  spell  was  created by a wizard whose abilities as a chef far  surpassed
those  of  his  spell casting. He is known far and wide as a  chef  of  great
skill.

This  spell  will, basically, stop all divination magic below  that  of  true
seeing  from  working properly. It will also stop all "detect ..."-spells  of
lesser  level than true seeing from operating properly. This spell will  even
stop  detection  through magical items like a robe  of  eyes  or  a  ring  of
invisibility  detection,  or through innate abilities  that  perform  similar
magic to that of "detect ..."-spells lower than true seeing, and the like.

This  spell  combines shocking grasp and chill touch. As on chill touch,  the
cold aura is generated and creates an aura around the caster covering him  on
all sides. All attackers should make a saving throw versus fear or paralysis.
The  next aspect of this spell is the release of an electrical discharge when
the  character touches a creature. The charge is a little less damaging  than
the  original  shocking grasp spell due to the energy being diverted  to  the
chill  aura. The damage ends up as 1d6+1 per level. There is no saving  throw
for damage.

immune to this spell (golems, undead, elementals, etc.). Creatures immune  or

      This  spell causes a volume of ice to crack and chip away.  This  spell
starts  at  the point closest to the caster, and chips one cubic  yard  every
half  round. Note that the pieces remaining can be rather sharp.  The  wizard
can  also use this spell to loosen densely packed snow into powdery snow. The
spell will affect one five foot cube of snow per level, each cube taking half
a round to loosen. If used against an ice based creature (para-elemental), it
will  do  1d3+1  points  of damage per level of the  caster,  save  for  half
(duration  instantaneous). Note that a non-solid snow  based  creature  would
take  only 1 point of damage per level, save for half. Cold related creatures
(white  puddings, white dragons, etc.) take no damage from  this  spell.  The
material  component is a hand sized ice pick, which must have a  metal  head,
which is unharmed by the casting of this spell.

      Note  that the Katti'n tribes had access to native copper, as  well  as
very  basic  metal working skills (they had copper swords,  axes,  and  arrow
heads,  so  hand sized ice picks were available). This spell  is  useful  for
creating  a storage niche or even an impromptu shelter in a large  ice  mass,
but it does not guarantee structural integrity. Still, a 10-foot cube hole in
a one-mile long glacier will generally be safe.

This  powerful  spell  allows a group of wizards to work  in  conjunction  to
create  a  special  area of effect (the circle) into  which  one  wizard  (or
possibly two) may enter and have their working level of experience increased.
A  minimum  of four wizards is required to initiate the spell, and the  spell
must be cast by the wizards of the circle, not read or used from any device.
First, the wizards form a circle and begin casting the spell. The spells from
each wizard must then synchronise into a rhythmic chanting effect. This means
that it will take as many rounds as the highest-level member of the circle to
make  the  circle  synchronise and become operative. From that  point  on,  a
wizard  may  enter  the  circle  and have his  working  level  of  experience
increased by the total combined levels of the circle wizards minus one  level
for  each member of the circle. Once entered, the central wizard may rest and
study  as  a higher level wizard, but may not use new spell levels, just  the
higher  memorisation capabilities, spell range, duration increases,  etc.  If
the  total number of levels bestowed reaches 20, another wizard may step into
the  circle and divide the increased level benefits between himself  and  the
first  wizard  with all odd remaining levels becoming useless  and  therefore
ignored.
Any  members  of the circle who are injured immediately fall  away  from  the
circle's  synchronisation and the central wizard(s) lose(s) the  benefits  of
that member's levels one turn later. New wizards may join into the circle  at
any  time  (taking  an  equal number of rounds as their experience  level  to
synchronise  with the circle), though, and since the effects of  being  in  a
circle will not wear off for one full turn other circles may be formed  which
the  wizard  may  enter to retain his current working level (or  increase  of
decrease it according to the levels of the new circle).
Members of the circle may chant (from the synchronisation point) for a period
of  turns  equal  to the combination of their Intelligence  and  Constitution
scores  divided by two and then added to their current experience level.  The
circle  members (but not the central wizards) gain a magic resistance to  any
attacks  against the circle which would silence the spell equal to the  total
experience levels of the circle members.
The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

By  means  of  this spell, the necromancer inscribes a circle  of  protection
(usually  with  magically prepared chalk) to which he "ties"  a  thaumaturgic
triangle  into which a demon or spirit or elemental may be summoned by  other
spells.  Inside  the  circle,  the wizard cannot  be  hurt  by  the  summoned
creature,  nor  can that creature be loosed except by the wizard's  will.  An
Intelligence  check  must  be made to determine if the  circle  was  properly
inscribed.
The  circle  (along  with any other merged inscriptions) may  be  temporarily
neutralized  by  simply rubbing a break. In this way, no creatures  may  find
their  way into the wizard's plane, though the circle may be easily  restored
by casting a restore circle spell and inscribing out the break.

The  material component for this spell is some incense to be burnt, worth  at
least 1000 gp.

When  cast, this spell causes a vicious set of serrated claws to grow on  the
hands  of  the  recipient. The recipient must be willing,  and  a  being  not
already  possessing claws. These claws vanish in one round per level  of  the
wizard.  They double the number of attacks normally afforded, and  damage  is
1d6 plus any Strength bonuses.
The  recipient  can  use  no  other weapons, nor  cast  spells  with  somatic
components. The material component is the claw of a griffin.

This  spell  enables a priest to conjure up a weak earth elemental    a  clay
beast  of  AC  4,  2 HD, MV 100 feet per round, 1 attack for  1d4  points  of
damage,  which  can be hit by normal weapons. It is about  5  feet  tall  and
appears  as a solid mud man. It moves as directed by the priest,  but  if  it
ever  becomes  separated from the priest by more than 30 yards, it  instantly
dissipates.  Any native to the elemental plane of earth can  disperse  it  at
will with a simple touch, even another clay beast.
The material component for this spell is a bit of clay.

      This  particular version of clean was researched by Carlene the Rose  a
few years earlier in her career, to maintain her appearance with care.

      When  cast, the recipient is immediately relieved of any dirt or  filth
from  the  body and clothes. The skin is softened as if washed by the  finest
soap and spiced perfumes. The hair is set back to a current fashionable style
as  envisioned by the wizard. These effects normally last until nature  takes
its toll upon the recipient.

      This spell also has a 5% chance per level, applicable once, of cleaning
the recipient of any non-magical skin disease or parasites.

The  material  components  are a small piece of soap  and  a  fairly  freshly
plucked rose or similar flower.

Upon casting this spell, the priest effectively cleans one person, animal, or
object per level of experience. If cast upon a person or mount, it cleans the
being  plus any personal belongings it has on it. Alternatively,  it  can  be
cast  on a 10-foot cube area. This spell affects dirt, grease, paint,  sweat,
etc., but can be controlled so it doesn't remove something that is permanent,
such  as oil in boots or paint on a shield. This spell is useful for a  party
that  is on the road for weeks without a chance to bathe. It can also be used
to  negate  the  effects of some spells. These spells  would  include  colour
spray, grease, etc. The material component of this spell is a piece of soap.

Shifting shadows is a spell that mimics the abilities of s displacer beast or
a  cloak  of displacement, using shadows to hinder weapons and spells.  First
attacks,  including  magic  missiles,  against  someone  cloaked  will  miss,
although multiple missiles will hit (the first one always misses). After  the
first  strike,  the cloak gives a  3 to-hit and damage against  the  shielded
person.  Spells are saved against at +3. The cloaked person cannot be clearly
seen  (except with true seeing), nor can his features be made out. The  spell
does not cloak voices, so if the cloaked person speaks, you might be able  to
tell who it is. The material component of this spell is a cloak.

This  spell allows the recipient to walk on any form of fog, cloud, or  smoke
as if it were solid. The recipient may move at normal movement rate, plus the
movement  rate of the smoke (thus a rising column of smoke from a fire  might
carry  the  recipient up at 12 movement rate). The smoke must  be  reasonably
thick,  reducing visibility significantly. This spell will not allow  walking
on fine mist. The material component is a hair from a nightmare.

This spell creates a black cloud of acidic smog. The cloud is stationary, and
restricts vision as a darkness spell. However, the cloud also has a  horrible
life  draining effect. Any in the cloud when it was created must save  versus
death  magic  or be drained of 1d2 levels. This draining only occurs  on  the
instant after the cloud is created, but is permanent.

This spell is similar to the 5th-level cloudkill. It will create a large blue
and  pink  billowing and churning cloud. The cloud will move  away  from  the
caster  at a rate of 10 feet per round. The cloud will move along the  ground
at  the caster's direction. A light wind will not affect the movement of  the
cloud  as long as the wizard is concentrating on the spell. A medium strength
wind will slow or change the direction of the cloud no more than one foot per
round  in  any direction as long as the wizard concentrates on the  spell.  A
strong wind will disperse the cloud after 5 rounds, unless the caster makes a
successful Intelligence check to keep the cloud together and under control. A
very  strong  wind will disperse the cloud after 2 rounds, but  if  a  saving
throw is made, the cloud remains, but the caster cannot control the spell for
that round. The caster must be spending all his concentration on keeping  the
spell active. Heavy vegetation will slow the cloud to one half speed but will
not cause it to disperse.
All creatures enveloped by the cloud are affected. All such creatures are put
into an alcoholic coma unless they make a saving throw versus poison (see the
Net  Alcohol Guide for more information). A successful saving throw means the
creatures become greatly intoxicated. Any creature over 10+1 HD or higher may
save versus poison at +2.
For  each  round  spent in the cloud, a creature must save versus  poison  or
become comatose. For each round beyond two spent in the cloud any creature or
character must save at a cumulative -1 per round, and after four rounds magic
resistance is reduced by 5% per round spent enveloped by the cloud. The power
of this spell is such that even creatures or persons immune to the effects of
alcohol, magical or otherwise, are affected by this spell after five  rounds.
There  are  no racial or weight modifiers to this spell (see the Net  Alcohol
Guide; it is recommended that DMs use the optional drunk disposition rule for
cases of great intoxication).
The effects of this spell are such that it extends the time needed to recover
from  a state of intoxication. For someone who became comatose, add 10  hours
to  the recovery time. Once the state of great intoxication has been reached,
it takes an additional 6 hours to recover. Once someone has moved to moderate
intoxication,  it  takes an additional 5 hours to reach  a  state  of  slight
intoxication. It takes an extra 2 hours to return to normal. Using stimulants
to  speed recovery is possible, but if the Constitution check is failed,  add
another  thirty minutes to the recover time of to this stage of intoxication.
Magical stimulants can be used with no ill effect. The spell also extends the
time  needed to recover from a hangover by 2d6 hours and makes the effect  of
the  hangover twice as severe. Obviously, this is a potent spell which in the
right hands could waylay a small army. The DM must be wary of how this potent
magic is used.

The  material  components for this spell are some  dried  grape  skins  or  a
sprinkling  of  the  best hops, which must both come from a once-in-a-century
harvest.  The third and most important component of this spell  is  the  blue
breath of a content alcohol dragon, without which this spell will not work.

This  spell  is similar to the spell cloudkill of the same level. This  spell
will create a large rose and white flowing and churning cloud. The cloud will
move  away from the caster at a rate of 10 feet per round, rolling along  the
ground  in  the  direction originally dictated by the caster.  A  wind  might
change  the direction of the cloud. A strong wind will disperse the cloud  in
two  or three rounds. A very strong wind will disperse the cloud immediately.
Heavy  vegetation  will  slow the cloud to one half speed  and  cause  it  to
disperse after two rounds.
All  creatures  enveloped  by  the cloud must be  compared  with  the  caster
according to their Hit Dice or level to determine the effect the cloud has on
the  creature  or  character. A creature with 3+1 HD will immediately  become
greatly  intoxicated. All creatures from 4+1 to 6+1 HD will become moderately
intoxicated  and  all  creatures of 7+1 and  greater  Hit  Dice  will  become
slightly  intoxicated. Any creature over 11+1 HD or higher must  save  versus
poison to avoid becoming slightly intoxicated. Each round spent in the  cloud
increases  the  chance of high and medium Hit Dice creatures to  become  more
intoxicated  and greatly intoxicated creatures to become comatose.  For  each
round spent in the cloud a creature must save versus poison or reach the next
higher  level of intoxication. For each round beyond four spent in the cloud,
any  creature or character must save at a cumulative -1 per round. There  are
no  racial  or weight modifiers for to this spell (see the Net Alcohol  Guide
for  more  information;  it is recommended that DMs use  the  optional  drunk
disposition rule for cases of great intoxication).
The  effects  of this spell are such that it will extend the time  needed  to
recover from a state of intoxication. For someone who became comatose  add  5
hours  to the recovery time. For great intoxication add 4 hours. For moderate
intoxication  add  3 hours and for slight intoxication add  2  hours  to  the
recovery  time.  Using stimulants to speed recovery is reduced  by  one  half
effectiveness unless magical stimulants are used. The spell also extends  the
time needed to recover from a hangover by 1d4 hours.

The  material  components for this spell are some dried grape skins  from  an
exceptional vintage or a sprinkling of the best hops.

The  Magic  of Nilrem is a series of humorous spells made in AD&D 2nd-edition
format.  They aren't intended for game use, but if a DM has a real  sense  of
humour, pertinent game information is included.
The cloud of misery is a small, dark grey cloud of moisture that floats about
10  15  feet  above  the affected creature. The effect of  the  spell  is  to
constantly  precipitate on its respective creature. It can be dismissed  only
by  dispel  magic. Other creatures that enter the cloud's area of effect  are
unaffected. The type of precipitation that falls on the creature at any given
time  is  normally  based on alignment and mood. The DM determines  what  the
effect  is  but  obvious  effects  are rain falling  on  miserable  creature,
lightning  on  an  angry or evil one, snow on a cold-hearted  creature,  etc.
While  under the effects of the cloud, the creature receives a  3 penalty  to
Charisma until the cloud is dismissed.
The  cloud  cannot be attacked, but it can be blown away by strong winds  for
1d4  rounds, after which it returns. If the affected creature attempts to fly
above  the cloud, the cloud rises until once again over it. The cloud follows
the creature to any other plane where the associated weather conditions could
exist  and  reappears in such planes if the creature travels to  a  plane  in
which  the  cloud cannot exist and then returns to one in which it  can.  The
material  component of this spell is either a small piece of dry  ice,  or  a
larger piece of normal ice and a crystal or jewelled bead of at least 200  gp
in value.

When  this  spell  is  cast, the priest enchants a gem,  turning  it  into  a
coalstone. The coalstone glows and gives off heat. It is hot enough to  start
a  fire,  ignite  flammable substances and shed light  in  a  5-foot  radius.
Holding  the  coalstone will inflict 1 point of damage per round  unless  the
wielder possesses some form of protection. The coalstone will burn for 1  day
per gold piece value of the gem used for a maximum of 1 year per level of the
priest,  after  which  the coalstone crumbles into  a  fine  powder.  Another
function  of the coalstone is that the priest may opt to cause it to explode.
This  will cause 1 point of concussion damage for every 100 days left on  the
duration  and  ignite  any  flammable objects within  a  5-foot  radius.  The
material component for the spell is a sprig of holly.

Using  this  spell,  a  high-level wizard can  rewrite  a  creature's  entire
personality.  All  the subject's memories, mannerisms, preferences,  beliefs,
allegiances, and behaviour can be changed to fit the wizard's specifications.
A  rampaging  giant  could be made into a music loving pacifist,  a  virtuous
knight  into  a  cowardly libertine, a demented killer  into  a  law  abiding
citizen - and vice versa.
There  are  limits on what the spell can accomplish. It cannot make  subjects
wiser,  more  intelligent, or more charismatic, though it can make  them  act
more  cautiously, thoughtfully, or pleasantly. It can also make subjects  act
more  foolish, like feeblemind. The spell cannot bestow new skills or improve
existing skills: class and level cannot be altered. However, it could make  a
fighter  think  like  a  thief, or make a wizard  believe  he  is  a  priest.
Furthermore,  it  will not function on creatures immune to  enchantment/charm
spells, including but not limited to golems, spirits, mindless creatures, and
the undead.
To cast the spell, the wizard must be alone in a quiet, secure place with the
subject, who must be physically restrained, magically held or charmed, or  be
cooperating  with or unaware of the caster's goal in casting the  mindbender.
The  caster burns rare incenses and draws arcane symbols on the subject  with
alchemical  ointments  - these components must cost at  least  1000  gp,  and
greater  amounts may be required for unusually large subjects,  at  the  DM's
discretion.  Then  the caster enters the subject's mind  through  a  powerful
telepathic  link,  and  over the course of 24 hours, edits  it.  This  ritual
drains  the  wizard's energies, and for the next three days he is  unable  to
cast any spells above fifth level.
At  the  completion of the ritual, the subject receives a saving throw versus
spell   at   -4,   subject  to  all  other  adjustments   including   Wisdom,
specialization, and malisions or mind fog. Magic resistance also applies,  as
do  the  racial bonuses and immunities of elves, half-elves, dwarves, gnomes,
and  halflings.  If the saving throw is failed, the subject's  alignment  and
personality  are  permanently changed, and only a second application  of  the
mindbender is sure to restore the old. A wish or restoration have only a  50%
chance  of succeeding, and the personality change cannot be dispelled, though
subjects do radiate enchantment magic to appropriate detection spells and can
be fended off by protection spells.
If  the  saving  throw  succeeds, the subject may eventually  throw  off  the
spell's effect. The spell's effects last as long as a charm monster (Player's
Handbook, page 154) automatically. After that, any time the spell would cause
the  subject to act contrary to his former nature, he immediately receives  a
new saving throw, without the -4 adjustment, to regain his old personality.
Note  that  once  the  ritual  is over, the wizard  cannot  again  alter  the
subject's personality. The new personality is set, and if the subject  throws
off  the  enchantment, he cannot again be affected by a mindbender from  that
particular wizard.
Within  the constraints noted above, the wizard can create whatever new  pehe
chooses.  Amnesia  can  be induced, new backgrounds invented.  The  subject's
emotional responses, his loves, hates, and fears, can be chosen. The  subject
can  be made fanatically loyal to the wizard, homicidal, suicidal, or genial,
contented, and charitable. Because it seems to deprive subjects of their free
will, use of mindbender is an ethical dilemma for many good magicians, though
most  agree  it  is  a  humane  alternative to imprisonment  or  death.  Less
scrupulous magicians find mindbender a most potent tool.

This  is a less powerful form of thunderflash, which only affects those using
infravision,  blinding them in all types of light however.  Those  not  using
infravision  will feel a wave of heat wash over them, but will  be  otherwise
unaffected.

To  cast this spell, the wizard raises his hands above his head, spread wide.
He  then brings them down and in to meet with a tremendous clap. This affects
all  within 20 feet and in front of his as a thunderflash (q.v.) but deafens,
and  does not blind (spellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast spells with  a
verbal component), and dispels silence, not darkness.

To  cast this spell, the wizard raises both hands above his head, crossed  at
the  wrist.  He  then brings them down and out in a slashing motion.  As  his
hands part, there is a brilliant flash of light, affecting all within 20 feet
and in front of the wizard.
Those  affected must save versus spell. All who make their saving  throw  are
stunned and reeling for 1 round, unable to attack, move or cast spells.  They
are also blinded for 1d6 rounds.
Those  who fail must make a second saving throw versus spell. Those who  make
this  saving  throw are stunned for 1d6 rounds and blinded for  a  number  of
rounds  equal to the caster's level. Those who fail again are stunned  for  a
number of rounds equal to the caster's level and permanently blinded.
Any  magical  darkness whose area of affect intersects  the  thunderflash  is
instantly dispelled.

Coin Toss gives an electrical charge to a single metallic coin, which is then
thrown  at  the  target.  The  casting of the  spell  appears  to  be  rather
innocuous,  but a bit theatrical (i.e., taking approximately  10  seconds  to
take  a  coin  out  of  a purse). Only a wizard who has this  spell,  someone
actively  using the spellcraft proficiency, or someone who has fallen  victim
to  this  spell  before will recognize that coin toss  is  being  cast.  Upon
completing  the  spell, the wizard throws the coin at  the  intended  victim,
requiring  an  attack roll. Treat metal armour as AC 10, but  allow  for  any
magical  or Dexterity bonuses. If the victim is actively trying to catch  the
coin,  consider it an automatic hit ("Take my last gold piece,  thief!").  If
the attack is successful, the victim takes 1 point of damage per wizard level
(up  to  a  maximum of 16 HP). If the coin is gold or another good conductor,
add  1 to the damage roll. If the victim is wearing metal armour, add 1d4  to
the damage roll.

The  material  component is the coin being throw, which is  consumed  in  the
casting.

This  power will create a shield of cold air around the psionicist
that  will absorb heat around the psionicist.  It will reduce  the
damage  of  heat based attacks by 1 hp/die or give  a  +1  to  any
saving  throw.   It  will  also  protect  a  character  from   hot
environments such as a desert, but not from super hot environments
like the elemental plane of fire.  It will also make the character
invisible  to  infravision.  Anyone trying to touch the  character
without  some  kind  of  protection  from  cold  will  suffer  1d6
hp/round.  The psionicist, however, will take 1d4 hp/round  damage
from cold if this power is used in a cold environment.

Power Score:  The power is doubly effective, causing 2d6 points of
damage, conferring a +2 bonus and saving 2 hp/die.

20:  Heat Shield power is activated instead, even if the character
does not know it.

      This spell causes a chosen surface to change colour, glow, or both,  be
it  a  section of wall, a box, a sword, or a creature (a saving throw  versus
spell  will  negate  the  effect if the subject is unknowing  or  unwilling).
Multiple  colours can be chosen (up t256 different colours  and  shades).  If
made  to  glow,  the  object will emit light for a range of  five  feet.  The
material  component  for  colour is a small amount  of  die  or  ink  of  the
appropriate  colour,  and  to  cause a glow, the  spell  consumes  a  bit  of
phosphorus or a glowworm.

This  spell creates twelve shards of ice. After the casting, the shards start
spinning around the caster in tight orbits at tremendous velocity. The shards
move with the caster, and will not affect the caster's movement, attacks,  or
spells.  If  anyone tries to physically attack the caster,  he  must  make  a
Dexterity  check at -4 for each shard or be hit by a shard. Each shards  hits
for 4d10 points of damage.
When a shard hits, it explodes into an ice storm which causes 3d10 of damage.
The  ice  storm  does not harm the caster at all: a globe of  invulnerability
protects  the  person  from the ice storm, but not from  the  impact  of  the
shards. As if that was not bad enough, each round the caster can command  one
shard to spiral out at a target, hitting it and causing an ice storm (no  to-
hit  roll  needed). See the notes on 10th-level spells in  the  Dragon  Kings
supplement.

The  priest  leads a prayer to his deity, that he may influence  the  day  to
come. All who participate (by repeating the prayer) inside the area of effect
gain  the influence. It is expressed by a +5%/+1 (or  5%/ 1) alteration on  a
single  die  roll  during the day to come. If not used  before  the  priest's
recycle  time,  the  benefit  dissipates.  Several  common  prayers  may   be
participated in by the same individual. The benefits stack, but their effects
are not cumulative.

      This cantrip causes a glowing arrow to appear in the cupped palm of the
wizard.  It  is  a light green in colour, and wavers around  in  the  general
direction of north. The spell will work underground, as well as at  sea,  and
is not affected by a lodestone, but it is only exactly right about 25% of the
time and may sometimes be completely off (10% chance). The material component
is a sliver of iron.

With this spell, the caster is able to understand any written message, in any
language of the present or the past. The writing must be non-magical, so  the
caster  cannot  read magical runes for example. The message can  contain  any
number  of  different languages or dialects at the same time; the caster  can
discern between them and understand them without difficulty.
The  caster can read the equivalent of one page per round, so most texts  can
be  read fairly easily. The caster fully understands the message, even if  it
contains  concepts totally alien to his way of thinking (in  that  case,  the
closest  thing will be formed in his mind). He is able to remember  it,  even
after  the expiration of the spell. This spell was designed for the Dark  Sun
campaign world. The spell was created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

      Compression  takes an object and compresses  it's  molecules
together,  making the object smaller and denser.   This  will  not
affect  it's  weight.   This  will  not,  for  example  allow  the
psionicist  to  shrink a boulder about to fall on  him.   It  will
compress  the  boulder, but since it has the same  mass,  it  will
cause  the same amount of damage, and in a more specific location.
This  power, if used, is like a giant hand compressing the object.
Inanimate  objects  or  plants  will  be  shrunken,  deformed  and
increased in density.  Think of a 20 lb chair 3 inches  high.   If
used  on intelligent creatures, they must save vs. death magic  or
suffer 2d10 points of damage per round and may lose a limb after a
few  rounds  of improper circulation.  The chance of  this  is  5%
cumulative per round.

Power Score:  Two objects can be affected

20:   The  psionicist gets a severe migraine and cannot use  their
powers for 2d4 hours.

Cast  this  spell  on a magic item and it renders that item  undetectable  by
detect  magic (great for hiding magical traps). The wizard will not  know  if
the  object has made its saving throw, though he can of course check this  by
casting a detect magic...

      When casting this spell, the caster condenses water out of the air, the
water  collects as dew on any appropriate surface or in a specially  prepared
container.  The  water  is not magical, it is simply  condensed  out  of  the
surrounding  air  the amount of water condensed is related  to  the  relative
humidity.  The  centre of the spell can be located at any  point  up  to  the
maximum range of the spell. The spell creates 2 ounces of water per 10 square
feet of the area of the spell, assuming up to 10% relative humidity (see  the
table  below for higher humidity). If the area of effect is not  at  an  even
number  such, as at fifth level (15 square feet), the caster should  get,  at
10%  humidity, 3 ounces of water, or 2.2 ounces at sixth level,  etc.,  until
you  get  4 ounces with 20 square feet, at tenth level. Consult the following
table:

Humidity     Water Condensed
---------------------------------
up to 10%      2 ounces
11-20%         4 ounces
21-30%         6 ounces
31-40%         8 ounces (1 cup)
41-50%         10 ounces
51-60%         12 ounces
61-70%         14 ounces
71-80%         16 ounces (2 cups)
81-90%         20 ounces
91-100%        24 ounces (3 cups)

The material component is a pinch of very fine river or sea silt, tossed into
the  air  when  the spell is cast. The water simply condenses on  all  nearby
surfaces  (trees, rocks, ground, characters, and especially metal). At  fifth
level, the condensed water can be directed into a specially constructed flask
or  jar.  The  somatic component is tracing the square in the  air  and  then
pointing toward where the centre of the spell will be.

     This spell can only be cast once in any particular area as it does drain
the  liquid  out of the air. The air around the spell's area of  effect  will
decrease  in  relative humidity by 10%. It may take two to eight (2d4)  turns
for  the  moisture level to return to a level where the spell could  be  cast
again.

Note: Athas is a very dry place, normal humidity runs at less than 10%, Athas
is  similar  to a high dry desert. A lucky character might meet  20%  to  40%
humidity  near a large river or lake, not a well, stream, or even  a  geyser.
The  only place that a character might find humidity over 50% would be in the
Halfling  Jungle of the Ringing Mountains' forest ridge. Needless to  say  if
this  spell was cast by a high level preserver in one of these areas of  high
humidity, it could be dangerous.

By  means  of  this spell a conduit to either the positive  or  the  negative
material  plane  is  opened (wizard's option, based on his  alignment).  This
channel can be used to infuse another wizard or a magic item with power.
If  another  wizard is infused, both wizards must make a saving throw  versus
death magic, at the level of wizard. A failure means both instantly pass out,
a  critical  failure (a roll of a natural one) means death for both.  If  the
saving throw is successful, the recipient can cast spells at triple power and
will not forget any spells currently memorised.
For  each  tenth of a round that the conduit is open, the wizard cannot  cast
spells  for  one full hour. The wizard may only keep a conduit open  for  one
tenth  of  a  round  for  each  point  of Constitution  plus  level  he  has.
Additionally, immediately after the conduit is closed, the wizard  will  fall
unconscious for a length of 10 times the time the conduit was open.
If  the conduit is cast into an object, and a permanency is added, it doubles
the  power of the item. In this case, add the levels of the spells cast  into
the  object. The number thus attained indicates the number of days the wizard
is unable to cast spells after regaining consciousness.

The material component for this spell is a small piece of hose.

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of fire originating  at
the  wizard's hand and extending outwards in a cone that is half an inch long
per  level of the wizard. It causes inflammable objects to catch on fire, and
great  heat  in  nonflammable objects. Damage is 1d4 + 1  per  level  of  the
wizard.  For  example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of fire  causing
10d4+10  points  of damage. Its material component is a red garnet  worth  at
least 100 gp (cf. cone of cold).

      This  low-level curse developed by the wizard Merlin, causes the caster
to  be confused to the point of being incapacitated. This prevents the caster
from  doing  anything that requires conscious thought during the duration  of
the spell, but also prevents enemies from gaining any useful information from
the  caster.  Also,  there  is  a 50% chance  that  the  caster  is  rendered
unconscious for 2d8 rounds, following the spells completion. This  spell  can
only be removed by a remove curse followed by dispel magic.

This  one  word  spell is cast immediately before any one  monster  summoning
spell. It allows the wizard to choose from the applicable list what creatures
are  summoned. The two spells must be cast in subsequent rounds; the enhancer
does not add any time to the casting of the monster summoning spell.

This spell is in all aspects the same as the spell conjure fire elemental  in
the  Player's  Handbook (q.v.), except that it opens a gate to the  plane  of
air, and that either an air elemental or 2d4 invisible stalkers are summoned.
87%  of the time, an air elemental will appear. The stalkers will appear when
the roll would indicate salamanders or an efreeti.

With this spell (akin to conjure fire elemental and earth elemental) a priest
can  conjure an air elemental or a related creature from the elemental  plane
of  air.  The elemental has no aggressive feelings toward the priest  as  the
priest  is  normally in good standing with the elemental planes.  The  priest
just  has  to  give a general set of instructions and the elemental  creature
will  try to fulfill them. Instead of a normal 16 HD air elemental there  are
chances for other air elemental creatures: 75% for a 16 HD air elemental, 15%
for  an aerial servant, 8% for a djinn, 2% for a 21 24 HD air elemental (fire
elemental duke).
The  material  components are an open stretch of air no less  than  100  feet
square plus the holy symbol of the priest.

This  spell  conjures the so called animentals, which are  animals  from  the
elemental planes, to the caster. These animentals may not have more than  the
caster's  level in Hit Dice each with a minimum of one Hit Die  per  creature
each. Animentals with less Hit Dice (1 1 HD, ® HD, or less Hit Dice) are  not
viable  on the prime material, not even with this spell. This means that  the
caster  will get a minimum of one creature (if he desires with a  maximum  of
one  Hit  Die  per level) up to a maximum of one creature per level  (with  a
minimum of one Hit Die).
To  determine how many Hit Dice a creature might have, add 50% of the  normal
animal's Hit Dice to the animental's Hit Dice, as their normal habitat  is  a
lot more violent than the prime material plane.
These  animentals are even less intelligent than their greater  cousins,  the
normal elementals. Although they follow the priest's desires willingly,  they
will  follow their own instincts in fulfilling them. They are very scared  of
the  opposing element and will not enter it under any circumstances, not even
if the priest charms them into doing so.
The  priest can determine which kind of animental he can summon (see  below),
but he can only conjure one type of animental. He cannot use any leftover Hit
Dice  to summon smaller versions. The conjured animentals have to be  of  the
normal Hit Dice variety of their type. The only animentals he can summon  are
those  that  have  equivalents in the natural animal  world.  These  conjured
animentals  tend to look like their real world cousins with the exception  of
being made up of their respective element.
The  animentals are affected by spells which affect animals as well as spells
that affect elementals of the appropriate type.
The  material components are the priest's holy symbol, a bit of  the  element
from  which  he  desires to conjure the animental, and a tiny  piece  of  the
animal type he wishes to conjure.

In  effect,  this  spell is very similar to the 3rd-level fireball.  However,
this  spell produces the flames by opening a direct channel to the  plane  of
fire, allowing the flames from that plane to intrude upon the plane that  the
caster  is  on and restricting them to a spherical area. The damage  done  by
this spell is 1d6 per caster level, up to 10d6. For level of the caster above
tenth,  two  points  of damage are added. The conjured nature  of  this  fire
negates  any magic resistance for creatures within the area of effect,  since
the flames aren't magical. The material component for this spell is a bit  of
volcanic rock.

      With  this spell the wizard brings forth the weakest kind of  elemental
possible: the fundamental (see the D&D Creature Catalog). Since it's a weaker
version  of  conjure elemental, everything else is the same except  that  the
amount  of  material to conjure the creature with is much less. A  shovel  of
earth, a bucket of water or a decent burning torch would suffice.

With  this  spell  the caster may freely summon one or more  lesser  radiance
quasi-elementals (see the table below). The creatures will do anything within
their power to aid the caster.
The lesser elementals can be sent back by the caster, one at a time or all at
once,  at  any time. They automatically return to their home plane after  the
duration of the spell. Conjured lesser elementals must be controlled  by  the
caster.  Otherwise, they simply assume a defensive posture until they  return
to  their  native planes. Lesser elementals will not attack the  caster  when
uncontrolled.  They may be controlled up to 30 yards away per  level  of  the
caster.
Note that radiance elementals cannot be summoned at night.

This  spell  is  similar  to  conjure  animental.  This  spell  conjures  the
equivalent  para-elemental animal, in short a paranimental. The paranimentals
survive  in an even more hostile habitat. Thus, they receive 75% greater  Hit
Dice  each  than their normal animal counterparts. Thus, a paranimental  lion
with  normally  4+4 HD would now have 7+7 HD. These Hit Dice  are  used  when
determining  how  many Hit Dice of paranimentals are conjured.  Leftover  Hit
Dice which are not sufficient to summon another paranimental are dropped.
The  paranimental follows the priest's desires willingly. The priest only has
to  instruct them and then can leave them to their task. They will fulfill it
to  the  best of their abilities but they are still not able to master  their
fear of the opposing para-element.
The  material  components are the priest's holy symbol, a part of  the  para-
element  from which he wants to summon the paranimental, and a  part  of  the
animal type that he wishes to conjure.

This  spell enables the caster to summon a female or male sexual spirit which
is  subject  to perform the caster's sexual bidding (this cannot be  combat).
The  spirit remains until dismissed. Casting this spell causes 1d8 hit points
of  damage to the caster, and each orgasm with the spirit requires  a  saving
throw  versus death magic. Failing this saving throw permanently reduces  the
caster's Constitution by one point. If the spirit causes someone besides  the
caster  to orgasm, both the caster and the other person must make the  saving
throw.
This  spell serves few purposes except as a sexual perversion of the  wizard.
The spell is quite popular amongst Necromancers.

This  spell is akin to the other conjure elemental spells. It normally  calls
forth  a  willing 16 HD water elemental, but in some cases it calls  forth  a
different water elemental creature. They are: 75% for a 16 HD elemental,  15%
for 2d4 mud men, 8% for a marid, and 2% for a 21 24 HD water elemental (water
elemental duke).
The  material components are at least 15 gallons of water and the holy symbol
of the priest.

Using  this  power  the  psionicist can teleport  an  object  from
another  location to his current location. The object,  which  can
weigh  up  to  50  pounds, must either be one that the  psionicist
knows well and can picture in his mind, such as his own sword,  or
one  that  is  within  his  sight (including  psionic  or  magical
detection such as clairvoyance or crystal balls).
      The  psionicist cannot conjure an object that bears a wizard
mark  unless the mark is his own. Neither can he conjure an object
that  is  firmly secured, such as a chest that is  bolted  to  the
floor. If the object being teleported is held by another creature,
a  psychic  contest  is waged using the other creature's  Strength
score  versus the psionicist's Conjure power score. If the  object
being  conjured  is  an  intelligent object (either  magically  or
psionically  endowed), the object can choose to resist,  in  which
case a psychic contest is waged using the object's Intelligence.
      The  difficulty of the conjuration, and the  cost,  increase
with the
distance  and  the weight of the object, as listed  on  the  table
below:

Distance  IC   PS   Weight    IC   PS
     10 yards  15   +1   < 1 lb    0    +1
     100 yards 20   0    10 lbs    0    0
     1000 yards     25   -1   25 lbs    +2   -1
     10 miles  30   -2   50 lbs    +5   -2
     100 miles 40   -3
     1000 miles     50   -4   *Players with the
     10000 miles    60   -5   SPELLJAMMER
     interplanetary*     70   -6   boxed set... (etc. etc.)

The  psionicist  can  have  the object arrive  in  his  grasp,  or
anywhere  within 1 yard of him, as long as it arrives on a  stable
surface.  He cannot, for example, conjure a boulder to  fall  onto
the head of his enemy. If the result of the power check is a 1  or
a  2,  the  object arrives at a random location 2d6 feet from  the
psionicist.
     Note: The 0 (1d4) preparation time denotes a preparation time
of 1d4 segments.

Power  Score:   The  cost of the conjuration  is  reduced  by  20%
(rounded  up),  and  all  penalties for the  object's  weight  are
ignored.

20:   The  object is conjured, but arrives in a location  that  is
detrimental to the object, the psionicist, or both. His sword  may
arrive in his grasp blade first, or a glass flask may arrive  just
beyond his grasp, only to fall to the ground and shatter.

When  this  spell is cast, it brings into existence a weapon of the  priest's
choice that he can use to fight with. The weapon is a normal weapon with  the
holy  symbol of the god engraved upon it. The weapon has a dim glow  upon  it
which  can be faintly seen. The priest, if he is to use the weapon,  must  be
proficient in its use. The weapon can be given to another character to use.
If  a  striking spell is used in conjugation with the conjured weapon  spell,
there  is  an  additional +1 to the to-hit and damage roll,  because  of  the
cumulative  effects  of  the magic of the spells. The  conjured  weapon  then
counts as a weapon, +2 for purposes of special defense.
The  weapon  stays  into existence until the end of the spell  or  until  the
priest  wishes  the spell to end. The verbal component would sound  something
like:  "Oh  Great Warrior Kos, give me a broadsword to smite down my  foes!",
and the gestures made are those to signify the priest's intent.

This  spell  causes  the recipient to begin to orgasm, repeatedly,  and  with
great  enjoyment, until the subject's body is no longer capable of sustaining
orgasm. The duration is based on level, but medically speaking, it could  end
when  the  body collapses from exhaustion, or (for males) when the  body  can
produce  no  more  seminal fluid. The DM may wish to  add  possible  negative
modifiers for combat, movement, etc. because of the victim's excited state. A
successful saving throw results in a single orgasm of normal duration.

Application  of this spell increases the Constitution of the character  by  a
number  of  points.  Benefits of constitution last for the  duration  of  the
magic.  The  amount of added Constitution depends upon the spell  recipient's
group  and  is subject to all restrictions on Constitution due  to  race  and
class. Multi-class characters use the best die.

     Class     Constitution Gain
     Priest    1d6 points
     Rogue     1d4 points
     Warrior   1d8 points
     Wizard    1d6 points

The  spell  cannot confer a Constitution of 19 or more, nor is it  cumulative
with  other  magic  that  adds to Constitution. All  hit  points  gained  are
illusory hit points that disappear when the spell ends. Damage is taken  from
these  illosory hit points first, and this damage is not transferred  to  the
normal  hit  point  total  when the spell ends. Beings  without  Constitution
scores gain one such extra hit point for each Hit Die.

The  material component of this spell is a few hairs, or a pinch of dung from
an animal known for its stanima.

This  spell gives the creature touched one spell level per caster level  with
which  spells may be cast. The freely chosen spells are then changed in their
aspects so that stay within a certain area of effect the caster specifies  at
the casting of these spells. This prevents the spells from expanding in their
effect into undesired areas as it so often happens with these unruly fireball
spells.
This spell may be layered up to a maximum of 2 spell levels per caster level.
As it works by touch it can be given to anyone who casts spells or uses items
which  duplicate spell effects (or spell-like effects). These  creatures  can
use  up  the spell levels at their leisure: This spell lasts until all  spell
levels have been used up.

The  material  component is a small silver box encircled with a  paper  strip
inlaid with a strip of hammered platinum which costs no less than 500 gp (the
whole arrangement).

This  spell will polymorph one creature (as per polymorph other) into another
until  some set condition occurs, eg. polymorphing a toad into a prince until
he  is  kissed by a woman, or polymorphing a fighter into a dragon  until  he
(it)  says  "I wish I were human", etc. The change from the polymorphed  form
back  into  the  normal form takes place gradually over 1  round,  so  it  is
impossible  to crush someone by polymorphing a hippo into a flea, putting  it
on  his head, then triggering the contingency. The material component of  the
spell is a bit of honeycomb.
This spell was researched by Esmerelda.

This  spell can be directed at any creature who looks the caster in the eyes.
The caster's eyes look watery and swirly at the completion of the casting, at
which  time  the  gaze can be used. The creature gets a saving  throw  versus
poison  at  -3  to  escape the effects (if so, the spell is  not  dissipated,
rather, it remains active until one creature is affected). A creature failing
its  saving  throw is made mystically drunk, and will remain so indefinitely;
an  analysis  of  the  being's aura or any magic designed  to  detect  charms
reveals the spell's existence.
The priest spell cure drunkenness negates it for as many turns as the casting
priest  has  levels, but after this time, the effect returns. The  creature's
level of inebriation is determined by the caster's level (see the Net Alcohol
Guide for more information):

     Wizard's Level Degree of Drunkenness
     3-5  Slight
     6-9  Moderate
     10+  Great

Gaze  reflection  or a mirror may be able to make the spell backfire  on  the
caster.  In  this case, the degree of mystical drunkenness is one  less  than
normal.  For  example,  if  the  10th-level wizard  Farsharn  has  the  spell

Farsharn won't be greatly drunk, but only moderately so. If this would reduce

curse is enough.

The material component is a handful of hops and a chip of glass.

This  spell  causes the affected area to become warm, maintaining a  constant
temperature of 40oC (96oF). This is intended primarily as a heat source,  not
an  attack, although if used against cold-based creatures, they will take 1d4
damage per round they remain in the area of the spell.
The  spell  is  reversible (continual chill), causing the area  to  lower  in
temperature to 0oC (32oF). Used against heat-based creatures, they will  take
1d4 damage per round during the time they remain in the area of effect.
Continual heat is very handy cast on blankets, etc., for those travelling  in
cold climates or in deserts.
Materials  required: sulphur for continual heat, clear crystal for  continual
chill.

This  spell  causes  the subject to become invisible, as  per  the  2nd-level
invisibility, except that instead of having a duration of 24 hours, it has  a
duration  of 1 turn per level of the wizard of actual use. Eg.,  if  cast  at
tenth  level, the subject could decide to use 50 minutes worth today and  the
other 50 minutes worth tomorrow. Note that this is not improved invisibility,
i.e.,  as soon as the subject makes an attack he becomes visible again. While
he  can become invisible next round if there is still unused duration in  the
spell,  his  opponent can make an attack on him; thus the  spell  confers  no
combat advantage after the first round.

This  spell  acts the same compared to continual light, as secret light  does
compared  to light. Preliminary research seems to indicate the spell requires
at least an ounce of blood from the wizard.
It  also  seems  that it would be possible to make a magical  lantern,  whose
light  would only be visible to the person holding it. The exact  process  of
its  manufacture is not very clear, however, and the spell has been  reported
to fail regularly.

A  modified  form  of the continual light spell, continual sparks  causes  an
object  or  area  not greater than a few square inches to  continuously  emit
electrical  sparks.  These  do no damage, but  are  a  tremendous  source  of
ignition around flammable substances.
A variant of the spell causes a spark to strike anything coming within 1 inch
of  the  area  affected. A small metal ball with both  continual  sparks  and
continual  light  cast upon it is a highly effective device  for  eliminating
bothersome insects.

This  spell  is  used to create a standing weather pattern  in  an  area.  It
creates  a zone in which the desired weather repeats indefinitely, and  lasts
until  dispelled. The varieties of weather possible are numerous, but  cannot
include cataclysmic upheavals of the environment.
It  is possible to cause precipitation, whose run-off vanishes at the borders
of  the  spell,  being recycled so as not to unduly disturb  the  environment
outside  the  spell's area of effect. Snow, sleet, hail,  and  rain  are  all
possibilities  for the continual weather. The temperature is  also  variable,
but  heated  or  cooled air does not heat or cool air outside the  zone.  The
maximum  temperature  of the zone is 110 F, and the minimum  is  -10  F.  The
humidity  (in  absence of precipitation) and wind speed can be set  as  well,
although  wind speed cannot be greater than 35 miles per hour.  Again,  these
effects end at the borders of the spell.
Astronomical oddities cannot be maintained by this spell: it is impossible to
have  a  region of eternal sunlight or star patterns. Day and night do  occur
within,  although overcast conditions may reign in the zone, and the heat  of
the sun has no adverse effect on snow or ice within.

The material component is a pinch of dirt from a wild magic zone.

This spell causes the affected area to have breathable air until the spell is
negated,  as long as the surrounding pressure will allow it (eg., in  shallow
water  the  pressure  will  not remove the spell, in  deep  water  the  water
pressure will reduce the area of effect considerably).
This  is  handy  for emergency breathing supplies within a poison  gas  area,
stinking cloud, etc. It is also in great demand by owners of mines to  ensure
that  the mine continues to be workable. It is also handy cast on the  inside
of  helmets to provide a flow of fresh air out of the helmet, thus  giving  a
positive  air  pressure, allowing the user to continue to breathe  underwater
<at  fairly  deep  water pressures) and also helps to  counter  many  of  the
effects of poison gas or stinking clouds (save at +4).
The  reverse,  continuous  unbreathable air, will cause  the  air  to  become
totally unbreathable, causing choking (1d6 per round while within the area of
effect) and making it difficult to cast spells (save versus spell to be  able
to do so). It also allows for some nasty traps in the bottom of pits, etc.
The  material components are a vial of oxygen for breathable air, and a  vial
of poison gas or stinking cloud for unbreathable air.

This  spell  and its reverse, continuous variable chill, cause  the  affected
area  to  become either warm or cool, the actual temperature defined  by  the
caster, variable within a range of 200oC (352oF) down to  20oC (0oF).
This  spell  was  intended  primarily as a heat source,  not  as  an  attack,
although if used against cold-based creatures, they will take 1d6 damage  per
round  per 50oC greater than 20oC they remain in the area of the spell (20oC:
no  damage, 70oC: 1d6, 80oC: 2d6, etc.). If the reverse is used against heat-
based  creatures, they take 1d6 per 20oC below 20oC (20oC:  no  damage,  0oC:
1d6,  20oC: 2d6). Continuous variable heat and its reverse are very handy for
making cooking stoves, heaters, or refrigerators.
The material components required are sulphur and wood for continuous variable
heat, and a clear crystal and ice for continuous variable chill.

      An  alternative to the sterility cantrip for DMs that don't  like  100%
protection,   this  cantrip  significantly  decreases  the   probability   of
fertilization  following  coitus.  The  cantrip  is  cast  after  any  sexual
activity.  In  some  cases this may not be lawful, and in  some  may  not  be
considered good. The cantrip is also not entirely perfect, offering only  95%
certainty, according to the following table:

D100 Roll Result
----------------------------------------------------
01-96       no fertilization
97          one zygote

With this science, the character can control the aging process  in
a  creature's body, causing to grow older or younger with a touch.
The rate of aging is 2-5 years per round to make a creature older,
1-3 years to make a creature younger. Although the aging effect is
permanent,  natural  aging will begin immediately  after  any  age
change  is made, thus the clock cannot be stopped, but it  can  be
moved  forwards  or backwards. In the case of undoing  magical  or
unnatural aging, the rate of "youthening" is 1-4 years per round.
     Only evil psionicists can use the "forward" power repeatedly,
without undoing it. Any other alignment will slowly twist to evil.
Likewise, only good psionicists can undo the ravages of time on  a
creature.  As  with  aging  forward,  any  repeated  use  of   the
"youthening" power causes the psionicist to tap into his own youth
and goodness.

Power Score:  The rate of age changing is increased by 2 years per
round.

20:   The  psionicist grows 2-5 years older, and cannot  use  this
power for another week.

This allows the dreamer to change the type of dream by one on  the
dream  scale  or  to change the alignment of a dream.   The  dream
alignment  can  be  change by one element in one  direction.   The
elements of the alignment are the two different halves.  The first
half  (Lawful,  Neutral, Evil) can be changed by switching  to  an
alignment  to the left or the right of the original one  shown  in
the  parenthesisabove. The same applies to the second half  (Good,
Neutral, Evil) The transition will last for as long as the dreamer
remains  in that Dreamland mode.  This power will only affect  the
Dreamland that the dreamer is currently in.

Power Score:  The dreamer may change two parts of the dream.

This  allows a psionicist to control any liquid (water, acid, ale,
etc.) to become animated and under the psionicists control.   This
is  a very limited power in that the liquid cannot become detached
from  the  original source.  This could be used to have a tentacle
of  water  attack creatures, create huge waves, make ale  monsters
for  amusement, or other strange effects.  The main limit  is  the
imagination of the psionicist.
If  the liquid is already in motion, then the psionicist can alter
its speed by 1 mile per hour/level.  This would give a +1/5 levels
bonus  on  saving  throws of breath weapons of  a  liquid  nature.
Water beings are unaffected by this power.

Power  Score:   The  liquid can detach itself  from  the  original
source.

20:   The liquid splashes on the psionicist (not a problem if it's
water, but acid is a different matter)

This  spell enables the wizard to cause fires as small as a torch or  lantern
to  become  as  large as a 6-foot diameter bonfire or to cause a  bonfire  to
shrink  to the size of a torch or explode into a fire with a diameter  of  18
feet. In this process fuel is burned according to the size of the fire.  Also
heat  dissipation can be adjusted which will also affect the amount  of  fuel
used.
The  amount  of  change a wizard can bring about in a fire is  determined  as
follows: take the wizard's level divided by 2 and round it down. This is  the
maximum  multiplier or divisor for the size (in volume) and  effects  of  the
fire.

The  material component differs for the two different uses of the  spell:  if
the  spell is used to increase a fire, the material component is a tinderbox,
which  is not consumed in the casting. If the spell is used to shrink a fire,
the material component is a drop of water.

cannot  be  learnt by others except with permission of the one who researched
the spell first or by the use of a limited wish. A full wish enables learning

After  this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful attack in  melee
to affect the target. The wizard's normal THAC0 is used with a +2 modifier to-
hit.  The  spell  will  last until a hit is scored,  or  until  the  duration
expires,  whichever  comes  first. If a hit is made,  the  victim  suffers  a
massive  heart attack and must make a successful system shock  roll  or  die.
Even  if this roll succeeds, the target suffers damage equal to 1d4 +  1  per
level of the wizard.

This spell causes a fiery explosion similar to that of a fireball, but with a
smaller  radius  (initially  a 20-foot radius sphere).  However,  the  flames
caused  by this spell will continue to burn for 4 rounds (the initial  round,
plus 3 additional rounds). The damage inflicted on victims inside the area of
effect, the bonus to the victim's saving throw, and the radius of the  flames
vary according to how long the flames have been burning, as follows:

     Round     Damage    Radius    Saving Throw Bonus
     1    8d8  20 foot   0
     2    4d8  15 foot   +1
     3    2d8  10 foot   +2
     4    1d8  5 foot    +3

Damage  suffered  is cumulative from one round to the next,  but  the  saving
throw  bonus  is not. Anyone who makes a successful saving throw  takes  only
half  damage  that  round, and automatically saves on any subsequent  rounds;
those  who  fail their saving throws suffer full damage, and  must  have  all
their  possessions save versus magical fire to avoid destruction.  If  anyone
leaves the area of effect and returns later, a new saving throw must be made,
even if the previous one was successful.
The  conflagration  may,  or may not conform to  a  confined  space,  at  the
wizard's   discretion.   Apart  from  the  changes   mentioned   above,   the
conflagration otherwise acts like a fireball.

The  material components for this spell are the heart of a red dragon, and  a
powdered diamond worth at least 600 gp.

This  spell alters the taste of and creates alcohol in any liquid. The caster
chooses the flavour of the alcohol to be created. With this spell, the wizard
also  chooses  the alcohol content of the liquid (equal to beer,  ale,  wine,
mead,  or liquor). There is always a 100% - 10% per level chance of the spell
screwing up. In this case, the DM chooses the taste.
Since  create  alcohol  really creates the drinks, at  least  partially,  the
transformed  liquid  will appear somewhat the same as the original.  Changing
beer to wine looks more like wine, but it may still be a little bit frothy.
The reverse of this spell, destroy alcohol, removes or lowers the quantity of
alcohol and its taste in the drink.

This  spell is somewhat of an anomaly in the series of create room spells  as
it  also  creates  the  exterior of the room. It  creates  a  complete  tower
including  battlements if desired. This tower is created from a cube  with  a
side length of 10 feet per 3 levels of the caster: an 18th-level wizard could
create  a  tower from a 60-foot cube. Thus, this wizard could, theoretically,
create a 180-foot high tower with a base of almost 35 feet square. This would
obviously a very unstable tower, thus the normal rule is: the base has to  be
at least a square of   the height of the tower.
Thus,  in our case the wizard could create a tower of approximately  40  feet
square  up to 120 feet high. The walls of this tower are made from adamantine
and  require  2 points of structural damage per level to get a  breach  in  a
10x10  feet section and an additional 3 points per level to collapse a  10x10
feet  section  completely. The walls are up to 1 inch per  level  thick.  The
tower  can  be  made  to  collapse if one levels loses  more  than    of  its
structural points or if more than 3 levels lose more than one tenth of  their
structural points. Anything in the tower at that time will most certainly  be
crushed (unless absolutely immune to magical, +5, metal). The tower can  have
up to one door per 10 full levels of the caster. The number of floors will be
determined by the height of the tower with up to a maximum of one  floor  per
10  (partial)  feet  height. This is also one of the room  spells  which  are
obviously  used for combat purposes so they don't vanish if used for  combat.
The  tower still cannot be sold - in that case the whole tower vanishes in  a
puff  of  smoke.  It  contains one full battlement with  merlons,  one  small
ballista  per 5 full levels, one shot for each ballista per level, one  light
catapult  per 10 full levels, one shot per catapult per 2 levels,  one  large
siege  pot  of  oil  or  lead  including fire for  heating  and  the  lifting
mechanism, 10 arrow slits per level, up to 1000 square feet of interior walls
per  level  (not including the floor and ceiling area), and up  to  one  iron
bound  wooden door per level in the interior, whereas the external doors  are
full  adamantine  doors with over 20 structural points each.  The  doors  are
magically  sealed  with wizard looks which open either to a  special  command
word  or  by  the caster's desires. In addition, they can be locked  normally
with the internal locks of masterful quality (-75% to lockpicking chances).
The  tower  is in itself non-magical. Thus, it cannot be collapsed  with  the
normal  use of an anti-magic shell (unless the shell is laid directly on  the
targeting  point  of the spell). Mordenkainen's disjunction  has  either  its
chance  against  an  artifact  to destroy it or  its  chance  to  dispel  it,
whichever  is lower. Dispel magic will only work if the caster himself  casts
it on the targeting point of the spell.

The  material  components are one large solid cube of pure  adamantine  of  3
inches  per level per side length. Into this cube have to be merged (with  no
space  between them) one diamond per floor level desired inside (of  no  less
than  10,000  gp each). The metal should cost no less than 1000 gp  per  inch
side  length (an 18th-level caster has a cube with 54 inches per side  length
(4'6",  which is more than a cubic yard of metal weighing a lot more than  20
tons), which makes 54,000 gp for the cube and at least 10,000 gp for at least
one  floor. This component can be used during preparation, but the spell  has
to  be  cast during the following 1 month per level time. If not cast  during
this  time,  the material component is used up completely. As this  spell  is
memorised,  it  can be dropped for another spell, but the material  component
used  in preparation is still lost. If the material component is used  during
the  preparation, the casting time is only 2 rounds, otherwise it is 3 turns.
The  block of adamantine is the targeting point of the spell. It will  always
be  found  at  the  base  in  the centre of the created  tower.  It  will  be
teleported there even if the caster does not know the teleport spell. It will
not  teleport across planes unless a direct link to the caster exists at  the
time.

This spell creates the interior of a bedroom. It contains one or more beds (5
square feet per level maximum), covered in sheets (rheumatic covers), a  thin
layer  of  covers (in summer) or succeedingly thicker for other  temperatures
(up  to  and  including Arctic temperatures), one pillow per two levels,  one
night table per 5 levels, one shuttered oil lamp (with oil) per table, a  bed
warming pan, some bed rugs, a small sparker set (to light the lamps), a small
wardrobe with sleeping gowns (male or female), a night cap for men, one beard
holder per level (any size), soft night slippers, and a covered bed pot. This
spell  creates only the interior of the room; it doesn't normally create  the
walls, floors, or ceilings.
As  with  the other room spells, no items can be used to cause harm, help  in
combat; nor can they be sold. If tried, they vanish in a puff of smoke.

The  material components: a small bit of cloth or fur (for the covers, gowns,
and  slippers), a drop of oil (for the oil lamps), a tiny piece of flint (for
the  sparker set), and a tiny piece of any kind of metal (for the  pot,  pan,
and lamp).

This spell (like the other room spells) creates the interior and supplies  of
a  room (in this case a dining room). It contains a large hardwood table  (30
feet  square per level), one soft chair per level, one soft header chair  for
each  end  of  the table, a complete set of tableware per seat  (including  6
forks, 6 knives, 6 spoons, a desert spoon, a bread knife, 6 plates, 8 glasses
(or  mugs), a cloth napkin), one silver covering bowl fitting for each plate,
one  candlestick per 3 levels (including lit candles burning for the duration
of  the spell), one flower arrangement per three levels, a white damask table
cloth fitting the table perfectly, name cards for each seat (holding names if
desired),  and some other minor necessities. It does not include  food.  This
spell  creates  only the interior of the room; it doesn't create  the  walls,
floors, or ceilings.

The material components are a tiny piece of cloth, a tiny piece of silver,  a
tiny  piece of glass (or crockery if mugs are desired), and a tiny  piece  of
wood.  As  with all other room spells, the spell can be cast with a one  turn
casting time or with a snap of the fingers; the second version requiring  the
caster  to use the material components during memorisation, adding a full  15
minutes  to  the  normal memorisation time. Again, as  with  the  other  room
spells, this one cannot be used for combat purposes, nor can anything from it
be sold from it.

This  spell  creates the interior furnishings of a small  dressing  room.  It
cannot  be used to create drinkable or consumable material unless it is  used
for  the  exact purpose it is intended for. Water or other material  vanishes
instantly  if it is not used for the required purposes (tidying oneself  up).
This  spell creates only the interior of the room; it doesn't normally create
the walls, floors, or ceilings.
If cast for women, it contains a mirror, a wardrobe, a small cushioned stool,
a  tooth  brush,  tooth paste (take your favourite bland), powder,  lipstick,
rouge,  perfume of the desired type, soap, body lotion, oil, nail  polish,  a
set of nail files and scissors, combs, brushes, wads of cotton, small towels,
a  small  bowl of water (warm or cold as desired), cloths stands,  a  Spanish
wall, and some other small necessities normally used in a dressing room.
If cast for men, it contains a mirror, a shaving mirror, a large bowl of warm
water,  a small bowl of water (warm or cold), a shaving razor, shaving cream,
small  towels, a brush, skin relaxant, eau de toilette, deodorant, a comb,  a
hair  brush, a tooth brush, tooth paste (pick your favourite bland), a finger
nail  cleaner, a nail clipper, and some other small necessities normally used
in a dressing room.
The  room  stays  only  for 5 rounds per level while the  effects  of  having
groomed  oneself (or someone else) with the kit from this room last  for  one
hour  per  caster level (even in the worst weather or after the most horrible
mud  fight,  one always comes out looking as one did after grooming  in  this
dressing  room). This effect does not offer any protection from any  harm  at
all. The items cannot be used to harm anyone (not even the wielder). Thus, it
would  be impossible to cut oneself with the razor, the scissors or clip  off
someone's ear lobe with the nail clipper. If tried the item causes no  damage
at  all  (not  even reducing stoneskins nor causing a caster to falter).  The
items  cannot  be sold: if tried, they vanish in a puff of smoke immediately.
They  can only be used for what they are intended (you could use them on your
pets  if  you truly want to - DM's decision). They cannot be used for  combat
reasons: an archer could not hide behind the Spanish wall for soft cover, the
wall would vanish instantly.

The  material component is either a tiny bottle of perfume for the  "female",
or  a  tiny  razor for the "male" version (costing no less than 50 gp  each).
They  can be used during the casting time (causing a casting time of 1  turn)
or  during  the  preparation, causing this time to  increase  to  45  minutes
instead  of  30 minutes. If used during preparation, the spell can  later  be
brought up with a snap of the caster's fingers and nothing more.

Dry  bones skeletons are essentially normal skeletons, but will come back  to
life  an  equal  number  of times as the caster has levels.  This  spell  has
particular  good  use with spirit legionnaire, spell carrier,  fireball,  and
permanency. The bones blow up each time you kill them - at least 16 times  -,
and  always have starting hit points. The material components for this  spell
are some mummy wrappings.

By  means  of  this spell, one of the rarest magical item that exist  can  be
created,  the  Focus. This extremely rare and powerful  item  is  capable  of
holding  the  energy  of any 10th-level or higher spell, which  is  extremely
useful  when  spell  weaving.  In  earlier  days,  this  item  wasn't  really
necessary,  because  although  physically taxing,  spell  weaving  was  still
possible. But when the Gods forbade mortal spellcasters the use of 10th-level
and  higher spells and destroyed most of the Foci, this spell gained much  in
use  because with this spell one could start to tamper with the magic of  the
Gods.
Note:  it  is  unlikely that a wizard will ever find this  spell  because  it
cannot be scribed onto a scroll and most spell books that contain this  spell
have either been destroyed or lost. So the only way a wizard is ever going to
get  this  spell  is  through a deity of some kind, which will  obviously  be
unlikely to grant it. Also, he will need an already existing Focus to cast it
because this in itself is a 10th-level spell.

This  spell  creates up to one ghast per six of the wizard, and these  ghasts
will  follow the commands of their creator to the best of their ability. Each
ghast is formed from the corpse of a human slain by a ghoul, or ghast who has
not yet risen as a ghoul itself. These corpses are the material components of
the spell. As implied above, humans killed by a ghast will rise as ghouls  to
follow the pack.

Create higher undead is used by evil necromancers to create some of the  more
powerful  undead  (most of these undead can also be created in  other  ways).
This  spell  will  create  wraiths,  mummies,  spectres,  swordwraiths,  soul
beckoners  and inquisitors. Other undead can be created at the discretion  of
the  DM. The wizard must have the correct spell components (listed below) and
then  cast  the spell, which takes about one turn per Hit Die of the  undead.
The  undead are not under the direct control of the necromancer, but they  do
tend  to  follow his commands. The source of this control is not loyalty  but
fear,  and  if the necromancer is weak then the undead may turn  on  him.  In
addition to the specific components listed below, the necromancer must have a
cup  of  dirt  from  a grave that is at least one hundred years  old,  and  a
considerable portion of his own blood. Due to this contribution of blood, the
necromancer  will be weak the day after the spell is cast (-2 to-hit  and  to
all saving throws), and the spell cannot be cast again before a full week has
past.
           Wraith: the body of an extremely evil human who obtained at  least
seventh level in life; five vials of unholy water created by the high  priest
of an evil religion (minimum of fourteenth level).
           Mummy:  the mummified body of an evil human who obtained at  least
seventh  level in life; a solid gold statue of an evil Egyptian god  (usually
Set; minimum 5000 gp value).
           Spectre: the body of an extremely evil human who obtained at least
ninth  level  in life; a painting of the person being animated (the  painting
must have been done when the person still lived).
           Swordwraith:  the body of an evil human fighter  who  obtained  at
least  seventh level in life (the fighter must have been part of  a  military
organization  and  must  have fallen in a battle where  his  side  eventually
lost).
           Soul  Beckoner: the body of an evil human, half-elf  or  elf  that
obtained at least eighth level in life (the person must have died of  natural
causes  and  must  have  been  either a wizard  or  a  thief;  a  philtre  of
persuasion).
          Inquisitor: the body of an evil human or demi-human who obtained at
least  seventh level in life (the person must have been a ruthless,  sadistic
torturer  who  was in charge of a torture facility); a rack or other  torture
instrument  on  which a paladin of at least ninth level has recently  (within
one year) been tortured to death.

This  spell  creates a complete set of kitchen utensils, including:  a  small
icebox  (large  enough for approximately 6 to 8 gallons of  fluid),  2  large
fireplaces  including a spit each, a stove with 8 fire places, an  oven  with
three  large compartments, 4 pots (large enough to contain enough stew for  a
very hungry halfling each), 8 small stirring dishes, 4 pans, 5 stirring pots,
3 hot water baths (for the pots), 3 cold water baths (again for the pots), 10
small  but  very sharp knives, 10 small spoons (for tasting), 5  large  forks
(for turning meat), 3 small hammers (for softening meat), 5 cutting boards, 2
egg  cutters,  a  salad dryer, 3 large mixing bowls, a large  sink,  3  waste
baskets,  10 wooden stirring rods, 10 pan scrubbers, 10 wooden turnabouts,  3
corkscrews  or  one  elaborate bottle opening set, and 3 serving  dishes  per
level.  This  spell creates only the interior of the room; it doesn't  create
the walls, floors, or ceilings.
The  utensils  cannot be used for anything but cooking or the preparation  of
food  (and  I  mean normal food, not what goblins consider food).  Thus,  the
knives cannot be used to attack someone (or even to defend oneself with), the
water  in  the water baths cannot be drunk or be used for washing or anything
else  but  heating or cooling food still in the creation process,  the  waste
basket  cannot  be used for anything but storing the remains of  cooking  the
food, etc. If it is tried the appropriate utensil vanishes with a small  puff
of  smoke. The whole set of utensils also vanishes at the end of the duration
including  anything  still  in the waste basket or  the  sink  unless  it  is
normally  not put into these containers (thus, this spell cannot be  used  to
escape  a hopeless situation or to create utensils for an escape or something
else). The utensils cannot be sold (if tried they vanish as above). They  can
only be used to prepare food. They will even vanish if they are used to block
someone's way during combat.

The  material  component depends on the quality desired: the caster  needs  a
small model of a kitchen knife, a pot, a pan, a tiny stove, a tiny bit of ice
(if the icebox is desired), a tiny splinter of wood, and a small spark. These
miniatures can be from almost any material (except the wood and the spark  as
they  are  necessary for the fire). The utensils will be of the same material
as  the  miniatures were made from. The caster can either use these  material
components during the actual casting or he can use it during the preparation.
If  it is used in the actual casting, the casting time is one turn; if it  is
used  during  the  preparation  time,  the  preparation  (memorisation)  time
increases to one hour (instead of 45 minutes), but the caster can then summon
the kitchen utensils at any later time with a snap of his fingers - ready  to
be used.

This spell create the body and soul of a new creature. The exact details  are
spelled  out  during the very long casting time. The new creature  is  always
level  0,  and must be trained like a new baby. The creature may have  innate
abilities,  but  cannot breed. The created creature is  not  magical  and  is
immune to dispel magic (although the creature may be able to wield magic once
trained).
A  mortal caster loses two points of Constitution, permanently. If the caster
fails  a Wisdom check, he dies. Else, the caster takes 2d12 points of damage.
A  demigod caster must roll 1d20; on a 20 his hit points drop to 1. Else,  he
takes 1d12 points of damage. Full deities take 1d6 points of damage.

fighting  ability.  The  mummy  follows  orders  to  the  limit  of  its  low
Intelligence, but it must remain within one mile of its place of  origin,  so
it  is primarily useful only as a guardian. The corpse of the potential mummy

      This spell creates a small wooden outhouse (including the walls, floor,
and  ceiling) which can be used for the obvious reason of - ahem, well, let's
say disposal of bodily wastes. It is furnished with a wooden sitting board, a
small wad of toilet-paper, a small bowl of water, and a small towel. Anything
which is usually deposited in an outhouse vanishes with it at the end of  the
duration.  This outhouse cannot be used to hide in combat (whether hiding  in
or  behind  it is irrelevant); if tried it will vanish with a puff of  smoke.
The  same goes if someone tries to sell it or if someone tries to take  money
for using the outhouse.

The  material  component is a piece of wood taken from  the  usual  outhouses
carved  into a small heart shape (yes, your outhouse has a small heart-shaped
opening in its door).

This  spell creates a poisonous liquid or gel. The potency of the  poison  is
dependant  upon the level of the caster. The saving throw against the  poison
is  at  -1 per 3 levels of the caster. Up to one ounce of poison per  casters
level  may  be created and be of contact, ingestion, or injection type.  Note
that  any  creature normally immune to poison will be totally  unaffected  by
this spell. The material component of this spell is a wand of hemlock.

This spell changes a normal (fruit) plant into a magical potion producer. The
plant  will  change over the course of one growing period (which might  be  a
short  3  or  4 weeks for grass and a rather long 2 or 3 years for  an  apple
tree)  until  it  reaches  an "adult" state. At this  state  it  has  changed
completely.  It  will then produce only some fruit each  picking  season  but
these  will  contain the power of a spell each. The powers contained  in  the
fruit were determined by the priest at the casting of the spell and can never
be changed afterwards except with a full wish spell. The priest may put up to
one  spell level per priest level of power into the plant. The single  spells
may have a power each of up to   of the priest's level (rounding up). Thus, a
priest of eighteenth level may instil a plant with the power to create fruits
which contain a maximum of one spell each, but each spell may be a maximum of
6th level, up to the maximum of 18 spell levels. Up to 3 fruits simulating  a
heal  spell  each would be possible. These fruits spoil as easily  as  normal
fruit, but they can be preserved and changed like normal fruit. If the  plant
is  of  a type which produces small fruit like raspberry, it is necessary  to
eat  one  pound of these fruit instead of only one. It is possible to  change
these fruit and their juice into marmalade or a pop sickle, if desired    the
products  still  contain  the  power of the  spell  until  the  products  are
consumed. It is possible to combine several potion fruit juices to  create  a
single  potion, but in this case the creator has to roll a potion miscibility
check; to this roll will be added the creator's level as a percentage (if  on
a  percentile scale), or one fifth the creator's level if 1d20 is rolled. The
maximum  effect  of  combination is one potion per 5 levels  of  the  creator
(round up).
The material components for this spell are the holy symbol of the priest, the
sapling  of the plant to be changed, one scroll containing each spell  to  be
given  to  the plant, and one ruby (a minimum of 500 gp each) for  each  year
that the plant is to survive.

This  spell  creates a new race. A spell such as this created the elves,  for
instance. The spell creates enough creatures to start the race.
A mortal caster loses 8 points of Constitution, permanently. Next, he ages 40
years, and dies. If his Constitution was lower than 1, he cannot be raised. A
demigod  caster loses 2 Constitution points. Roll 1d20; on a 20, the  demigod
dies.  Else, he takes 3d12 points of damage. Full deities lose one  point  of
Constitution, permanently.

This  spell  creates a complete smithy. It includes a forge (normal  metals),
large  forge  with  articulate  bellows (for very  hard  metals  (up  to  and
including  mithril), a full set of hammers, a full set  of  clamps,  a  water
basin  for  tempering,  a large anvil, a small curved anvil,  small  smithing
tools, a set of metal chisels, a set of artistic metal working tools, a small
amount of welding wire, a welding iron, and several other miscellaneous tools
for  metal  working.  The spell creates only the interior  of  the  room;  it
doesn't create the walls, floors, or ceilings.
The tools cannot be used for combat nor for sale. They cannot be used to hide
behind, under or in. If any of these are tried the whole arrangement vanishes
in  a puff of smoke. Water or other material vanishes instantly if it is  not
used for the required purposes.

The material components can be used either during casting (for a casting time
of one turn) or during memorisation (for a memorisation time of 1 hour and 20
minutes). If the material components are used during casting the casting time
is  one  turn. If they are used during memorisation the smithy can be created
with a snap of the caster's fingers.

complete area of effect, one aisle rug per full 5 levels, one altar with  all
the necessary religious regalia, one chandelier per 2 levels with one hundred

priest), one holy or unholy water basin per level, one holy symbol per level,
one  speaking  tier, one banner per level with the pictures of the  religion,
one  alms  basket per level, and one choir tier per 10 levels up to two  feet

This spell creates the interior of an opulent throne room. This includes  one
or  two softly padded thrones of over 10 feet height standing on a tier  made
up  from  one  step per level (each half a foot high), a large  (red)  carpet
leading  from  the  entrance of the room to the tier in the  straightest  way

The  material components of this spell are a human corpse (not older  than  3
days),  myrrh (500 gp worth) and a special balm made of certain  rare  herbs,
personally  prepared by the necromancer. Ingredients for this balm  cost  500
gp, and one uninterrupted week spent by the spell wizard. The balm only stays
good for 3 days.
This  spell  forces back the soul of the corpse, and turns it into  either  a
wight,  a  spectre, or a wraith. The wizard has a percentage chance equal  to
twice  his  level  of  choosing  which is created.  Otherwise,  roll  on  the
following table, adding the level of the wizard, plus a 5 bonus if the wizard
is  a  necromancer specialist. Also, if the corpse was a person of  level  0,
subtract  30 from the roll (if the adjusted roll is below 0, the spell  fails
and the corpse is destroyed).

     D100 Roll Created
     1-60 wight
     61-90     wraith
     91-00     spectre

The  corpse gets a saving throw versus death magic, at a level equal  to  the
corpse's level before death, with the following bonuses:

     Person was     Modifier
     a good priest  +4
     a non-good priest   +2
     good non-priest     +4
     neutral non-priest  +1

If  the saving throw is made, the corpse is destroyed and the spell fails. If
the  saving throw is failed, the undead is created. Said undead will be under
the  control of the necromancer for one year, following any order that is not
obviously  suicidal. At the end of the year, or upon such time as the  undead
receives  a  suicidal order, it is freed from the necromancer's  control  and
gets  a  saving throw versus death magic. If it fails, it must leave and  may
never  attack  the  necromancer unless attacked first.  If  it  succeeds,  it
becomes  free-willed, and might attack the necromancer if it was sufficiently
mistreated.
Note  that  after  the  year  is up, the undead may  continue  to  serve  the
necromancer,  if  it  was sufficiently prosperous and receives  a  sufficient
bribe. This is a DM call.
A  necromancer can only control one undead in this matter at a time.  At  the
end  of the year, or when the undead dies or becomes uncontrolled, the  spell
may  be used again. Should this spell be used during the year, it will  work,
but the fresh undead will immediately attack the wizard.
Finally,  a  created undead starts out the same alignment as the corpse  from
which  it  came.  However, due to what these creatures  must  feed  on  (i.e.
people),  an unstoppable shift begins towards the undead's normal  alignment.
There  is  a 10% chance per month (cumulative) of the alignment decaying  one
step. After a switch, the chance returns to 0 and begins building again.

hear  the  recipient  of crier's boon over a normal crowd  as  if  they  were

      Crier's  boon  has  been used for countless years by  town  criers  and
nobility alike to address large numbers of persons. Many times, this spell is
used  in  conjunction with power word, attention (q.v.) to great  effect.  To
cast  this  spell, the wizard is required to take a piece of fine vellum  and
roll it into a cone-like shape during the casting of the spell.

This  spell creates an immobile wall of dark red flame, 20 feet high  and  10
feet long per level of the caster. Within the crimson flames of the structure
one  can  see  horrible  twisted images of evil  souls  departing  the  prime
material  for torment in the abyss. The wall can be shaped in the form  of  a
circle, but not into a dome or sphere.
Anyone,  even a creature with magic resistance, must save versus death  magic
every  round they are within sight of the wall or they will flee in fear  for
one turn. If they are unable to flee, they must save versus death magic every
round  for  the entire turn or become permanently insane (DM's choice  as  to
variety).  Creatures that are blind, either naturally or by  blind-fold,  are
unaffected by this function of the spell.
Anyone, even a creature with magic resistance, passing through the wall  will
be drained for 6d6 points of damage; no saving throw. The hit points can only
be  recovered  by magical means. If an individual survives the  draining,  he
must  make  a  saving throw versus death magic at -3 or be carried  with  the
souls to the abyss; items remain on the prime material.
The  caster, and up to one person per level of the caster, are unaffected  by
the  fear component of the spell. However, anyone is affected by the draining
and possible planar transport if they pass through the barrier.
Since  the wall cannot be shaped into a sphere, it is feasible for a creature
to  fly  over or dig under the wall to attack the caster. However, since  the
caster  will probably be close to the wall anyway, the attacker must continue
to  make  saving throws versus the fear element, regardless of which side  of
the wall faces the intruder.
Lastly,  in the event of a creature being thrown into the abyss upon  passing
through the wall, there is a chance that something from the abyss will arrive
in place of the missing creature:

     D100 Roll Creature
     01-30     None
     31-65     Type III demon
     66   Orcus (no, he will not be amused)
     67-99     Type IV demon
     00   Creature is returned with new, evil soul

The caster has no control over creatures that arrive from the abyss.
The only material component for the spell is a sanctified bone holy symbol of
the primary god of murder.

This spell will instantly remove all effects of alcohol intoxication from one
target's  system. This instantly alleviates hangover, lack of  sobriety,  and
all associated effects of being drunk or its immediate after-effects. It will
not  cure  or  abate  maladies caused by long-term  alcohol  abuse,  such  as
cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholism, heart disease, etc.
The  reverse, cause drunkenness, will make its target instantly and  severely
drunk.  The drunkenness caused will last as long as normal drunkenness  would
last,  and may bring on a hangover. The severity of the drunkenness is slight
if  cast  by  a  2rd 5th level priest, moderate if cast by a  6th  9th  level
priest,  and  great  if cast by a 10th level or higher priest  (see  the  Net
Alcohol Guide for more information).

effects  of  recovery. Note: It may be difficult for a wizard  to  cast  this
cantrip upon himself if intoxicated, given the chance of spell failure.

The  casting  of this spell cures one mental malady in the subject.  Insanity
applies  to  any  form of temporary or permanent mental illness,  even  those
brought  on  by  a  psionic attack or a spell, such as  feeblemind.  See  the
Dungeon  Master's  Guide  for  examples  of  mental  maladies.  The  material
component of this spell is a piece of wadding.

By  means of this spell, a priest is actually able to convert a being who has
been  changed into a vampire back to his mortal self again. At the same time,
it  changes the cursed being from an undead status to a living creature again
(since  a vampire is inherently a dead mortal). The spell must be cast within
5 days after the vampire to be cured has been slain or it will not work.
After  casting  this spell, the cured vampire must rest for a minimum  or  24
hours before engaging in any activity.
Cure  vampirism  is not as simple as just casting the spell  and  changing  a
vampire. The material component of this spell is the heart of the vampire who
originally  cursed the recipient of the spell with vampirism. In many  cases,
this  will  probably send the characters on a quest to destroy  the  vampire.
Only  a  fragment of the heart is necessary to cast the spell. Therefore,  if
several  people  have been inflicted by the same vampire, the  heart  can  be
divided  up and used as the material component for all to receive the  spell.
However,  if  the  vampire  is destroyed and there  is  nothing  left  (total
destruction  by sunlight, for example) then the spell component is  lost  and
the  spell  cannot  be  cast. The recipient vampire must  make  a  successful
resurrection check or the spell will fail and the victim will not be able  to
be raised again.
In  addition  to  the original vampire's heart, the spell also  requires  the
priest's  holy  symbol  and a stone altar (on which  the  body  is  laid)  as
material  components.  The altar must be decorated  with  gems  and  precious
metals  worth 10,000 gp and is fused into a worthless lump of obsidian  after
casting.

This spell is a slightly more potent version of cure light wounds. At the end
of  the  casting time the priest lays his hands on the creature he  wants  to
cure.  His touch restores 2d4+2 HP to the creature. This spell does not  work
on creatures without corporeal bodies or those of extraplanar origin.
The  reversed  spell,  cause vicious wounds, works  similarly,  although  the
priest's  touch inflicts 2d4+2 points of damage on the affected creature.  If
the creature is trying to avoid the touch, a successful attack role has to be
made by the priest.

By  laying his hand upon a creature, the priest heals 3d8 points of wound  or
other  injury damage to the creature's body. This healing cannot affect  non-
corporeal, non-living or extraplanar creatures. Because of the heat the spell
causes  inside its body, the creature for this day needs 1® times the  normal
amount of water (or the following day, if the spell is cast at night).  Also,
very flammable objects (lamp oil, for example) worn or just carried may catch
fire. The reverse of the spell, harm with fire, operates similarly but causes
damage. The material component is the caster's holy symbol.

The spell causes non-fire based weapons, that is, all except those related to
or  made with fire, to be awkward to hande. For example, obsidian weapons  or
fire  arrows  are  not  affected, while iron or steel ones  are.  This  makes
creatures  using  them to be non-proficient in their use, even  if  they  are
actually specialised in them. The creatures receive the usual non-proficiency
penalties pertaining to their class.

This  spell is used to curse the weapon of an opponent. When it is cast,  the
wizard chooses which weapon to curse. Unless the owner of the weapon makes  a
successful saving throw versus spell, that weapon will have a penalty applied
to all to-hit and damage rolls for the duration of this spell. The penalty is
equal  to  1  for every four levels of the wizard, to a maximum of  -5.  This
penalty  only applies to the chosen weapon, not to other weapons  carried  by
the owner.
This spell will negate magical bonuses (only for the spell's duration); if  a
weapon's  magical bonus is reduced, its current value is used for determining
which  types  of creatures may be hit by it (i.e., if a sword,  +4  sword  is
reduced  to  +1  by this spell, it cannot be used to hit elementals  for  the
duration of the spell).

The  material component of this spell is a small replica of the weapon to  be
cursed; it is consumed with the casting.

This spell allows the priest to place one of four curses on the victim:
          Ageing. +10 years to age.
          Bane. Discomfort, uneasiness, inability to sleep well.
          Hex.  1 to to-hit rolls and saving throws.
          Ugliness. Reduce Comeliness by 2d6 (down to a minimum of 3).
The  priest  must be able to see the victim to curse him. The  priest  cannot
actually pick one of the above effects: the effect is determined at random.

This spell curses one creature with one of the most horrible existing curses:
the  curse of lycanthropy. The creature has saving throw versus death  magic;
if  it saves, the spell is negated; if it fails it is affected as below.  The
creature  is turned into a lycanthrope of the caster's desires. It might  not
even  be apparent that the creature has suffered under the spell - until  the
next  full  moon  sets in. At that point the creature will  change  into  the
lycanthrope desired by the caster and it is under the complete control of the
caster who is immediately notified that one of his creatures has changed into
a  lycanthrope. The caster can see through the creature's eyes, hear  through
the creature's ears, and use all other senses of the creature as the creature
can.  He  can even force the creature to do his will. If that is  tried,  the
creature  gains  a saving throw versus spell to resist the command.  Once  it
resists  one  command  per level of the caster, it is free  of  the  caster's
control and the caster cannot use its senses any more nor can he try to force
the creature to do his bidding. Until this point is reached, the creature has
no  chance whatsoever of being cured - unless a full wish is used. After this
point  is  reached, the normal chances exist for the creature to be cured  by
the normal means. Note: during the time the creature is a werecreature it has
no recollections of what it was as a human, elf, etc. and vice versa.
The  effect  of  this  spell is permanent unless it  is  cured  somehow.  How
difficult  this  is is dependent on the DM. The duration of  the  control  is
dependent as described above.

The  material component is the head of a master lycanthrope (one who controls
at  least  ten others of its type) of the type the caster wishes the creature
to  be  changed into. The head has to somehow have stayed in its animal shape
without  changing  back to its normal humanoid shape. This  head  has  to  be
treated  like a tathlum (a druidic or Celtic weapon, described in the Legends
and  Lore book). It also has to be hurled at the opponent. The caster has  to
make  a  to-hit  roll;  if he does not hit the target,  the  spell  (and  the
component) is wasted.

This spell causes a creature which fails a saving throw versus death magic to
be under a horrible curse. The creature will live a normal life until it dies
(whether  of  natural  causes  or unnaturally does  not  matter).  Then,  the
creature   is   transformed  into  an  undead  creature   of   the   caster's
specifications (within special limits). This does not happen until the  night
after  the creature's death. The creature can be a creature having up to  the
maximum of half the caster's Hit Dice and it may be any kind of undead up  to
and  including a ghost (note: it is not possible to create a lich or  special
undead via this spell). The creature is completely under the caster's control
if  it  fails a saving throw versus spell against each and every one  of  his
controlling attempts. Once the creature has succeeded at one saving throw per
caster  level, it is completely free from the caster's control and  it  knows
who  tried  to  control  it and it bears an everlasting  hatred  against  the
caster. The caster can make use of its senses even if he is on another  plane
(note:  this  is  not  possible if the caster is feebleminded,  disminded  or
otherwise not in control of his body or mind). The creature can be cured with
a  remove  curse, an atonement, and a heal before it dies, all cast with  the
explicit purpose to remove this spell. Once the spell is in effect,  and  the
creature  dies,  only the immediate blessing of the slain  body  prevent  the
transformation to undeath. Note: a resurrection is possible, but if it is not
done  before the next nightfall, the creature will transform into  an  undead
being.  Once  the creature is transformed, it cannot be saved, unless  a  god
reverses the situation directly (not by sending an avatar but by being  there
personally and laying on hands).

The  material components are a pinch of bone or a drop of the essence of each
type  of  undead that exists on that planet (or in that sphere if  used  off-
planet).  The caster has to have an additional full pound of bone or  essence
of the type of undead creature he wants to create. Thus, it will take lots of
ghost ichor to create the fleeting substance known as ghost's essence in  the
required amounts. How to get the stuff is the wizard's problem, not mine...

      With  this spell, a wild mage can attempt to enhance one aspect of  the
next  spell he casts. This second spell must be cast in the round immediately
following the casting of Cyril's attempted enhancement. However, due  to  the
randomness of the spell, the wild mage only has a 50% chance of enhancing the
second spell.

     The wild mage first casts this spell and states the aspect of the second
spell  he  wishes  to enhance. Possible aspects include the area  of  effect,
range,  duration, damage, or a -2 penalty to targets' saving throws.  At  the
end  of  casting,  the wizard is covered in a green glow. This  glow  is  the
latent energy he will direct into the second spell to attempt to enhance  it.
On the second round, the wizard casts his chosen spell.

     After Cyril's attempted enhancement is cast, the DM rolls 1d6. On a roll
of  4-6, the chosen aspect of the second spell is doubled. On a roll of  1-3,
the  second spell still functions, but the chosen aspect is halved (or  a  +2
bonus  is applied to the targets' saving throw) and a wild surge is generated
from the uncontrolled magical energies. Regardless of the 1d6 roll, the level
variation  roll (see the Tome of Magic) must be applied before modifying.  If
the  second  spell is not cast in the round immediately after this  spell  is
cast, Cyril's attempted enhancement is wasted. If the casting of either spell
is interrupted, both spells are lost (the second spell is, in fact, tied into
the first one when casting the first spell).

The  material  components for this spell are identical to  the  spell  to  be
enhanced.  Note  that this requires the mage to expend two of  each  material
component  in order to cast both spells. For example, to double the  duration
of  a  light  spell,  the  caster  needs  two  fireflies  or  two  pieces  of
phosphorescent  moss.  If  the second spell has  no  material  component,  no
material component is needed for this spell.

This  spell  allows  the wild wizard to call forth a burst  of  energy  which
automatically results in a wild surge. However, the wizard has  a  chance  of
controlling the surge to a limited degree. After the spell is cast,  roll  on
the  wild surge table. The wild surge will happen, but the wizard has  a  33%
chance of controlling some part of the spell. First, determine what the  wild
surge  will be. The player (or the DM) then rolls 1d6. On a roll of 1-4,  the
wild surge results as per the description of the surge. On a roll of 5-6, the
wizard  may  control one part of the wild surge's effects. He may change  the
centring  of  the spell, the duration, the damage, etc. Exactly what  can  be
controlled  is  left up to the DM (have fun with this). For example,  if  the
wild  surge resulted in a fireball centred on the caster, and the attempt  to
control the surge was successful, the wizard could move the centring  of  the
fireball,  he  could decrease the damage, or cause it to be a  delayed  blast
(again,  this is up to the DM). If the wild surge is not detrimental  to  the
caster,  he may still attempt to alter the effects. He could move the flowers
pouring  from his mouth to pour from the mouth of someone else. An aside  for
the  DM: have fun with this, but watch out. You'd be amazed how much a player
can do with a single wild surge when he can control it a bit.

This  spell  creates  a cord similar to the one created with  Cyril's  bungee
snap. However, there are a few notable differences.
This cord will loop itself over the caster and one other creature within  the
range  of  the spell. On the round after the casting, the two will  be  drawn
together  to  meet in the middle of the cord. They will not hit  each  other,
however,  and  will pass harmlessly past one anther until the cord  stretches
out  to  its  original length. In essence, the two switch places  in  between
rounds. During the "in between round switching", both are allowed a melee  or
item attack on the other when they meet in the middle. These attacks are made
at a +2 to-hit.
The  cord  will  continue  to  switch the two  back-and-forth  for  its  full
duration,  unless  cut. The caster can cut the cord at any  time.  Any  other
character  may  cut the cord by successfully dispelling it or  by  inflicting
damage to it with slashing weapons. The cord has an Armour Class of -2 and as
many  hit points as the caster has levels. If the cord is cut before the full
duration has been reached, a wild surge results. The person who cut the  cord
is  treated  as the caster and the person attached to the cord  and  furthest
away  from the cut point is treated as the target for the wild surge  result.
If the caster himself cuts the cord, his level is added to the surge roll, as
per Nahal's reckless dweomer.
Both  the  caster  and the target may take any normal action  during  regular
rounds (between switches), but all actions are at a +6 penalty to initiative.
Movement  is restricted to one quarter the normal rate. Armour Class  bonuses
for  high  Dexterity are lost while entangled in the cord, as  are  Dexterity
bonuses to hit with missile weapons. If either the caster or the target  move
such that a solid object is between them, they are still drawn together,  but
will  take falling damage, much as in Cyril's bungee snap, and the cord  will
be cut, causing a wild surge.

The material component for this spell is a piece of gold wire, looped at both
ends.

This  unique  spell allows the wild mage to pull wisps of raw magical  energy
directly  from the astral plane to create a magical "bungee" cord.  The  term
"bungee" was chosen by Cyril. He had heard the word long ago and didn't  know
what  it meant, but has always liked the sound. He believes it to be  from  a
long-forgotten  language. Two loops on the ends of the cord are  then  looped
over  two  items  or  creatures. After the wizard has  looped  the  cord  and
released  control of the magic, the raw magical energy in the cord  collapses
in  upon itself, pulling the two items or creatures together at a magnificent
velocity.  Only  creatures who are magically anchored  or  objects  that  are
securely attached to something else are immune, although the DM may  allow  a
"bend bars" roll for a character who reacts quickly to grab onto something.
Note  that there must be some way for a magical cord to fasten itself to each
item. For example, a tree can be easily looped, but a wall can only be looped
if there are protrusions or other fastening points for the cord.
The  two items or creatures are drawn together and will hit each other. Items
drawn against items must save versus crushing blow or be broken into no  less
than  50 pieces. An item drawn against a person need not save, but the person
will  take falling damage in accordance with his previous distance  from  the
object  (1d6 per 10 feet with a maximum of 10d6). If the item is particularly
small,  the DM may impose less damage. Cyril prefers bouncing people  off  of
walls  with this spell. If two people are drawn together, each takes  falling
damage for half their previous distance apart.
In  all cases, the DM may call for Strength or Dexterity checks to hold  onto
items and saving throws versus fall to check for item damage. In the case  of
a  creature  drawn to an item, a saving throw is allowed for half damage.  No
saving throws are allowed for two creatures drawn to each other.

The  material component for this spell is a piece of string, looped  at  both
ends.

This  spell is similar to the 1st-level Nahal's reckless dweomer, in that  it
releases the power of a wild surge, in the attempt to create a useful effect.
Unlike Nahal's reckless dweomer however, this spell does not allow the caster
to  name an "attempted" spell. To balance this drawback, the caster has a 33%
chance  of  controlling some aspect of the surge created. Since no  spell  is
named as "attempted", there is no other effect than the surge.
When  this spell is cast, the caster should name a target. The DM then  rolls
up  a  surge, adding the caster's level as a modifier, and rolls 1d6. If  the
die  rolled is 3-6, the surge proceeds as rolled. However, if a 1 or a  2  is
rolled,  the DM should announce the surge to the caster, and give the  caster
an opportunity to control some aspect of the surge.
For  example,  if the surge "a fireball explodes, centred on the  caster"  is
rolled,  the  caster could choose to exercise control by saying  "the  damage
from  the fireball is the minimum possible". Another example would be to  set
the  duration  of  the surge "the target is slowed" to the maximum  possible.
Aspects  that  can be controlled include damage, duration,  area  of  effect,
range,  and  a +2 or -2 modifier to saving throw. Aspects that are  given  in
random ranges (such as "2d6" or "1d6 + 1 round per level") can be altered  to
at  best the maximum or minimum of the possible range. Aspects that are given
in absolute numbers can be halved or doubled.
If  the surge rolled states that the "attempted" spell succeeds in some  way,
the  DM should re-roll the surge, as there is no attempted spell with Cyril's
surge mastery.

      This  spell causes the target, and only the target, to hear a  piercing
scream  of  utter  terror  and  anguish for a  split  second.  The  sound  is
sufficient  to waken most slumbering pretties, or to require a  Wisdom  check
(roll  under Wisdom -2 on 1d20) for wizards casting a spell. A wizard failing
the  check will have his spell casting interrupted. The caster must point his
finger at the target.

      Katrine  originally  devised this spell for  those  party  members  who
weren't responding to buckets of water in the morning.

This  spell  is used to stop all mental and psionic powers from  affecting  a
specific  being.  This is accomplished by creating a field around  the  being
affected  that  stops all mental energy from passing through it.  This  field
however  stops  the mental energy from both entering or leaving.  Thus,  this
could  be  used  to  stop a psionicist from using any powers  on  anyone  but
himself.  It  also  grants  immunity to any psionic  attacks,  including  the
dreaded mind flayer mental blast. It provides protection from any spell  that
deals  with  the  mind of the person protected as well as any psionic  power.
This  spell  is  quite similar to mind blank, except that  it  provides  full
protection against psionics and a few other mental powers. The list of spells
that  are  protected against is too long to list, but if a spell affects  the
mind of a being, it will not work. The material component of this spell is  a
diamond shield, worth at least 10,000 gp.
Dalen was a Red Wizard of Thay, but was overthrown by another wizard who  had
a  psionicist  working for him. Dalen researched a way to stop psionics  from
working,  and partially succeeded. He was hoping that a wall or sphere  could
be  created, but found that this was impossible, because all the research  he
found  pointed  to  the fact that such a field would  have  to  be  in  close
proximity  to a living being, no more than an inch away in fact. Dalen  later
died when he tried to cast this spell on a psionic lich. Since the spell only
affects living beings, which a lich is obviously not, Dalen was reduced to  a
mental vegetable and subsequently killed.

If a wild mage casts a spell resulting in a wild surge during the duration of
this  spell  he is given a 10% chance per level up to 90% change to  memorise
the  actions  that resulted in the wild surge. Once a wild  surge  effect  is
memorized the wild mage can them try to recreate the surge through the use of
any reckless dweomer. Since the wizard is attempting to recreate a wild surge
with the dweomer, he gets two rolls on the wild surge table with the addition
of  the wild mage's levels to the rolled surge. If neither surge rolled is an
accomplishment of the spell it is the DM's discretion on which surge occurs.

The material component of the spell is a sheet of paper and one vile of ink.

Due  to  his  personal dislike of lightning the archmage Damian crafted  this
spell  to  specifically counter its harmful effects. When  cast,  this  spell
seems  to cover the wizard in a pale blue light resembling an envelope.  Once
cast the wizard gains 2 Benefits (much like fire shield):
           a  saving throw versus lightning at + 2 indicates no damage to the
wizard. A failed saving throw merely indicates half damage. If, at any  time,
the wizard is hit by any acid or acid spell, the wizard must save normally or
take double damage.
          if any melee attacks are made on the wizard, on a successful strike
the wizard takes normal damage but so does the attacker.

The material component is a self addressed stamped envelope.

When this powerful enchantment is cast, the wizard attempts to rip the target
creature's soul from its body and temporarily place it in a gem of  not  less
than  15,000  gp value. At the same time, the wizard's soul is released  from
his  body and also travels through the gem. When, and if, both souls  are  in
the  gem, they both proceed to the opposed bodies from which they came.  This
has two very noticeable effects:
           The  wizard and victim have essentially swapped minds (or  bodies,
whichever you prefer). This has the effect that the wizard now takes  on  the
physical  attributes  of  that  body (Strength, Constitution,  Dexterity  and
Comeliness).  The wizard does retain his own mental capacities  and  previous
knowledge (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma), hit points and level.
           If the wizard or victim can kill his former body, the other's soul
goes  to  its respective plane. Thus, after completion of the spell,  if  the
wizard  kills his old body, he can never be displaced from his new body,  for
in all intents and purposes it is his body now. If neither the wizard nor the
victim  is killed, and at some later point in time a priest casts an exorcise
spell at either body (both have to be within 70 yards of each other, though),
the caster of the original mindswap must save versus death magic or return to
his old body.
If  the  saving  throw is made, this indicates that this person's  body  will
never  accept the wizard's soul and need never fear this spell from the  same
wizard again. After the transferral has been completed, the gem disappears.

This  spell  -  except  as noted - is the same as dancing  lights  (from  the
Player's  Handbook). The lights are orange-like in colour and give off  heat.
If  the  wizard concentrates on the balls, he can have them attack doing  1d3
points  of  damage per ball (4 balls maximum). All the balls must attack  the
same  target in any given round. Optionally, the wizard can form a mass  that
looks like a fire elemental and can attack once per round doing 3d3 points of
damage. The heat can set fire to flammables.

The  material  components needed are a piece of flint and  either  a  bit  of
phosphorus or witchwood.

This  spell creates up to one globe of light per level of experience  of  the
caster.  Each  globe may be controlled separately and individually,  and  can
float,  bob,  and otherwise behave rather like the lights from the  1st-level
wizard  spell dancing lights. The globes must either remain in sight  of  the
caster  or stay within a 30-foot per level radius lest they instantly vanish.
They can move as fast as 200 per round.
The  globes  may be given a variety of simple commands by the  caster.  These
commands  may  be individual (eg.: "globe 6 stop there in the centre  of  the
intersection")  or  global (eg.: "all globes spin around  the  head  of  that
figure"). The globes are not intelligent, hence cannot be given commands that
require more discernment than a magic mouth could handle.
The  globes  are  1  foot in diameter and can be varied in colour  (any)  and
brightness  (anywhere  from a guttering candle to  a  light  spell  for  each
globe).
This spell has several major uses:
          An improved, more eerie version of the 1st-level spell.
          To provide portable illumination. The lights can brighten things on
ledges,  in rooms, in pits, etc., without risking any party member's  health.
Since  each  globe can be the equivalent of a light spell, this  illumination
can be quite significant.
           To  try to distract opponents in long range combat. Folks in melee
usually  dodge, jump, and otherwise dance about too much for  this  spell  to
affect  them. Archers and spellcasters, on the other hand, need to  be  still
and concentrate in order to be effective. For every three globes spinning  or
flashing around the eyes of a single archer, missile attacks are made at a -1
penalty  to-hit.  For example, if Zarg tries to shoot his  crossbow  while  8
globes  whirl and oscillate around his head, he will get a -2 penalty to-hit.
Spellcasters must make a Wisdom check at a -5 bonus to the roll in  order  to
keep  their  concentration & avoid botching the spell. For every globe  after
the  first,  the caster gets a +1 penalty to the Wisdom check. For  instance,
Abulator  is trying to disintegrate Malithe while 4 globes spin in  front  of
his  eyes. Thus, he must make a Wisdom check at a -2 bonus to the roll or his
spell fails.
The  globes  may be destroyed in two ways. A successful dispel magic  cancels
every  globe in its area of effect. The alternative is to destroy the  globes
physically.  They  may be hit by magical, silver, or iron  weapons  (but  not
steel  or  wooden ones), have AC 0, and can take as many points of damage  as
the  caster has levels of experience. Damage from spells will also  harm  the
globes, though they are immune to fire and electrical damage of any sort.

When  this spell is cast, a small dusty ecru-coloured sphere will issue  from
the palm of the wizard's hand. When hurled in the air the sphere will explode
at the desired range into a billowing cloud of cascading dust and powder. All
creatures in the area of effect must save versus death magic. If the  targets
make their saving throw they are only effected for the first three rounds  of
the spell. Otherwise they are affected as follows:
Round  1:  The victim's eyes begin to burn, their mouth becomes parched,  and
their  lips begin to crack. They lose -2 on their to-hit and initiative rolls
this  round.  Spell  casting is impossible for the  duration  of  the  spell.
Lastly,  the  creature endures 1d4 points of damage this  and  all  following
rounds.
Round  2:  This round, the sweltering heat and scorching dryness engulfs  the
character's whole body. They lose -4 on their to-hit and initiative rolls and
all Dexterity and Strength bonuses.
Round  3:  By this round the victim feels as if every pore in their  body  is
ablaze.  This pain is so intense it blinds them and drives all other thoughts
from their mind. The charactercan only lash out with a -6 on their to-hit and
initiative rolls and a loss of all Dexterity and Strength bonuses.
Round  4: The agony of fluid being torn from the body is so savage this round
the  character  falls  to the ground tearing at his  clothes  and  body.  The
character's anguish is so severe they lose 1d4 points of Constitution  for  a
turn.  Besides  the  previously stated penalties the character  can  also  be
attacked as if they were stunned or prone.
Round 5: see round 3.
Round 6: see round 2.
Round 7: see round 1.
All  fire-using, undead, animated, and related creatures are immune  to  this
spell.  However, all amphibious creatures, slimes, jellies, puddings,  molds,
and  water-using  creatures incur twice the duration  and  intensity  of  the
spell.

The  material  components of this spell are several pinches of powdered  bone
and a bit of spittle.

This  spell  causes  the  rapid ripping and rending of  all  fluids  from  an
individual  through every pore and mucous membrane of their body.  The  spell
takes the form of a pale cone of oscillating ecru desiccants. The cone formed
is  five  feet  long and one foot in diameter per level of  the  caster.  For
example,  a 12th-level wizard would cast a cone 60 feet long and 12  feet  in
diameter.
Any  creature struck by the undulating cone must save versus death  magic  or
have  their bodily fluids sucked away leaving behind only a mummified  shell.
If  a creature successfully saves, it still suffers 6d4 points of damage  due
to the extreme stress the spell inflicts on the creature's body.
Certain  aqueous beings are highly susceptible to the effects of this  spell.
All  amphibious creatures, slimes, jellies, molds, and water-using  creatures
under  4 HD are automatically destroyed when exposed to this spell, creatures
over 4 HD suffer a -2 on their saving throw. At the same time all fire-using,
undead, animated, and related creatures are immune to the spell.

The  material  component of this spell is an ounce of ground silica  and  one
mummified insect.

The  casting  of  this spell causes an incandescent sphere of blistering  dry
heat  to envelop a 25-foot radius around the spell caster. All vegetation  in
the  area  of  effect  will  instantly  wither  and  die  from  the  seething
temperature  as  the  grobuckles and cracks like  hardened  clay.  Any  flesh
exposed to this incinerating hellfire will stiffen and crack like old leather
and  quickly  peel  away  from  the body. This crematorium-like  effect  will
continue  until  all that remains are the creature's bleached  and  crumbling
bones on the barren and lifeless ground.
All  creatures  caught in the spell's area of effect must save  versus  death
magic  or  have the spell's torrid fervour snuff the life out of them.  If  a
creature  saves,  it  takes  1d8 points of damage  and  loses  one  point  of
Constitution for a turn. A creature must continue to save each round they are
in the ardent sphere with a cumulative penalty of -1. The incandescent sphere
doesn't harm the caster and follows him as they move for the duration of  the
spell.
Certain  aqueous beings are highly susceptible to the effects of this  spell.
All  amphibious creatures, slimes, jellies, molds, and water-using  creatures
under  6 HD are automatically destroyed when exposed to this spell, creatures
over  6  HD  suffer a -2 on their saving throw. Only fire-using  and  related
creatures are immune to the spell (undead are not immune to the spell).

The material component of this spell is ground diamond (500 gp) and a drop of
the caster's blood.

This spell keeps one to several cubic feet of material (organic or inorganic)
impervious to water and related liquids. The spell forms a minute film of air
around the desired object that slowly denatures and collapses allowing  water
to  seep  in  as the spell ends. This spell is useful in protecting  valuable
items like spellbooks and bows from liquids that could ruin them.
This  spell also reduces the amount of damage a character sustains from water
elementals and water-based attacks.
The  film  of air surrounding the character acts as a buffer protecting  them
from  the  full  impact of the creature's blows. A character  protected  with
Dardan's  dryness receives a +1 on all saving throws (per  5  levels  of  the
caster) from such attacks for the duration of the spell.

The material component of this spell is a beetle's car

Dardan's  siccating parchment is identical to Dardan's dehydration except  as
noted below. This spelis highly unusual in that it must always be cast from a
specially prepared parchment scroll. To begin the process the parchment  must
be  cured by immersion in a vat of alcohol and salt for three days. While the
parchment  is  curing, the wizard must prepare a special ink of dried  blood,
saliva,  and diamond dust (500 gp). When the wizard has completed  these  two
tasks, he may then inscribe the spell onto the scroll in a rite requiring two
full  days  without interruption. Finally, the scroll must be sealed  with  a
paste made of vinegar, clay, and lye.
Anytime after the sealing of the scroll the magic held within can be released
by  breaking the fragile and brittle seal. When the seal is broken a wave  of
rapidly  expanding  concentric rings of chalky beige particles  will  emanate
from the scroll. All creatures in the area of effect except the bearer of the
scroll will be effected as if Dardan's dehydration were cast upon them.
The  rite  and components used in casting this spell make the parchment  very
frail  and  delicate.  Special care must be taken in storing  the  scroll  to
prevent the magic from being released accidentally.

This  spell allows the priest to grow forth from one of his fingers  a  vine.
While  any  finger  from either of the priest's hands is  usable,  the  index
finger  of the priest's primary hand is generally chosen. The vine,  while  a
magical  extension  of the priest's body, is treated as a  separate  physical
entity, therefore having an AC 5 and 30 HP (plus an additional 2 HP per level
of the casting priest).
The  spell ends when either the maximum duration is reached or the vine takes
more  damage than it has hit points. The vine moves in a snaking fashion  and
is usable in most ways that an arm is. It uses up one of the priest's actions
to use the vestigial vine, so, if a priest had only 1 attack per round and he
chose to attack a creature with the vine, he would be incapable of performing
another action until the following round.
The  vine can attempt to retrieve an object, wield a sickle or similar weapon
(although  at  a to-git penalty of  2 due to the unwieldiness of  a  man-made
weapon  in a vine's clutches), or it may be used to whip opponents.  Whipping
is  the  primary form of attack of the vine and, assuming a successful to-hit
roll (with no adjustments), the target will receive 1d10 points of damage.
The  material component for the spell is a small strand of vine and the juice
from half a dozen holly berries (squeezed from said berries).

This  spell  was designed in order to aid one in freeing oneself  from  webs,
viscous  globs, and other such sticky substances which can be dissolved  with
alcohol. The material component, a flask of any alcoholic liquid, must merely
be in range for the spell to work.
Upon  the  casting  of  this spell, the caster's body begins  to  emit  great
amounts  of  alcohol, which spray in all directions for the duration  of  the
spell. The caster may wish to waterproof his more delicate belongings to save
them from damage before casting the spell. Any substance which could normally
be dissolved with the aid of alcohol is quickly broken down.
Note  that  the  alcohol sprays reach a 20-foot radius, so  that  a  sizeable
section  of  web or such could be covered. Note also that alcohol  is  highly
flammable, so this spell should be used with caution.

This  Metamagic spell can be used in conjunction with any one bolt-  or  ray-
class spell of less than seventh level, such as lightning bolt. It allows the
wizard to specify "pivot points" at which the beam will change direction.  Up
to  1  pivot per 5 levels of the caster can be specified, and at each  pivot,
the bolt or ray can be made to alter its path up to 120 . The casting time of
the  secondary spell is included in the "middle" of the bend bolt  spell,  so
use  the casting time of the affected spell plus 2 for the two halves of this
Metamagic spell. It is possible to deceive targets as to the bolt's  intended
direction in this way, and many other such tricks are possible. Up  to  a  -3
penalty  can  be inflicted on a deceived target's saving throw.  It  is  also
possible to hit multiple targets in this fashion. DM's option: it is entirely
valid  to require some sort of ability check to see how well the caster  aims
the beam's turning. Not every wizard is an automatic pool shark.

This  spell, when directed out toward intelligent targets, causes them to  be
immediately  dominated  by  the  force  of  logic.  Targets  must  be   truly
intelligent  and must have thought patterns which run along roughly  humanoid
lines (so it does not affect cloakers or similarly alien creatures). Friendly
targets  may  waive their saving throws versus the spell's  effects.  Hostile
targets  save  versus  spell, with their magical defence  bonus  from  Wisdom
working against them (in effect, their wisdom does not help them save against
it; instead, it helps the logic take hold), acting as a penalty rather than a
bonus in this case.
The magic of the spell is such that it stills all emotion, causing a crystal-
clear rationality to take hold of the targets' minds. Lycanthropes can resist
an  involuntary change, berserkers have their rages stopped in mid-hack,  and
spells  such  as  fear  or emotion have no effect. It  causes  the  creatures
affected to be temporarily emotionless.
The  logic  lasts  until it is disrupted by the target succumbing  to  strong
emotions.  Each  time something happens which would normally evoke  a  strong
emotional response in the target, they must make a Wisdom check (with magical
defence  bonuses subtracted from the roll). A failed check causes the  effect
to end with respect to that target.

This  Metamagic spell only adds 1 to the previous spell's casting time,  with
the  somatic  component  consisting of the caster pointing  directly  at  the
intended target. This spell brings the full force of an area effect spell  to
bear upon a single target. Any area effect spell of up to fourth level can be
used  with this magic. Offensive spells require a saving throw versus  breath
weapon by the target, and, if successful, the spell does 2 HP of extra damage
per die with all ones rerolled. If they fail this saving throw, they take the
maximum  damage  for the spell (as cast at the level of the caster).  If  the
spell  is  not a mere damage spell, but inflicts some other effect, then  the
target's  saving throw versus the effect is lowered by 1 for each  equivalent
extra target that the spell would normally affect. In no event can this spell
be  used with a spell that normally affects only a single target, or with  an
area affect spell over fourth level.

This  spell  functions in a similar way to the 3rd-level item spell,  but  is
designed  to work upon living creatures. A creature affected by the spell  is
altered  into  a piece of cloth, as per the item spell. Very small  creatures
who  have been itemized will be cloth pieces of roughly life size, but  large
ones are shrunk to no more than 1x1 foot cloth representations. While in this
state, they are in a state of suspended animation, and could remain in such a
state  indefinitely.  If  an intelligent being's possessions  have  all  been
itemized  previously (disregarding magic items - those resist  the  process),
then  they will be included in the final item. A willing creature can  forego
its  saving  throw;  charmed  creatures  are  considered  willing.  Unwilling
creatures  (who have somehow been kept still for a turn) get a  saving  throw
versus  polymorph to resist the change. The cloth piece resulting is somewhat
resilient, getting +3 to all material saving throws, but if destroyed,  kills
the  creature. Returning the creature to (normal) life merely entails tossing
it  upon the ground (with this being the stated intent) or speaking a command
word specified by the caster upon casting.

This  spell is a relatively insidious and nasty way to render a fortification
useless.  The  wizard  casting it touches a portion of a  man-made  structure
(castle,  etc.) of less than small-city size and casts the spell. A patch  of
frost  in  the  shape  of the wizard's hands will then form.  Every  3  turns
thereafter, the patch will grow irregularly, covering 10 yards of  additional
radius,  and  unless  stopped,  will  coat  the  entire  structure  with   an
exceptionally  cold  layer of icy frost. Dispel magic,  if  successful,  will
force  the  frost back 10 yards in radius, but the original patch  cannot  be
dispelled  with dispel magic alone. Fire spells will remove the frost  within
their  area of damage until the frost spreads back over the burned  spots  in
time.  The original area can only be removed with the casting of remove curse
and  flame strike together. This will disrupt the spell entirely. A structure
coated  in  this  ice  will be at least 20 C lower in  temperature  than  the
surrounding climate, and even lower in a hot area. Contact with the ice  will
cause  1 HP of damage per round of touch. The ice is also very slick,  making
movement upon it hazardous. The wizard casting the creeping frost curse  will
be  unable to cast ice or cold related spells for a month afterwards,  unless
he is a specialist water or ice wizard. (that is, if you allow ice wizards).

This  spell  "loads" any one 1st-, 2nd- or 3rd-level spell that  is  normally
cast via touch into a bolt of magic which can be used to deliver it at range.
Single-charge spells, such as shocking grasp, are fired through the bolt  and
work  normally on the target if the bolt hits. If a spell works over a number
of  rounds rather than a certain number of touches, or if there are  multiple
possible  charges delivered over a series of touches, then the spell  can  be
"fired"  through these bolts, one bolt per round throughout the normal  spell
duration.  Other  types of touch spells should be dealt  with  in  a  similar
manner  at  the  DM's option. Beneficial as well as offensive spells  can  be
loaded  and  launched  in this manner. Only one spell  per  casting  of  this
Metamagic  spell  can  thus be affected. The casting time  of  the  Metamagic
includes the casting time of the secondary spell within itself, adding  2  to
the  latter's normal casting time. The bolt looks like a pointy beam of light
in the wizard's preferred colour. Note that the caster must make a successful
roll  to-hit for the bolt to strike its target, unless the target is  willing
to be struck or cannot dodge.

      Created during the dark one's social days, it was designed to relieve a
budget  strained  by  money spent on fashion changes.  This  spell  instantly
transforms  the  clothes  which the wizard is currently  wearing  to  another
design of the caster's imagining. However, low-price, shoddy raiment may  not
be  transformed into finery, but the opposite is possible (and the cheap rags
resulting  may be reverted to their original, expensive state).  The  clothes
are  also  mystically  cleansed and freshened with each  transformation.  The
clothes  will  maintain their altered state while in the  possession  of  the
wizard  or  until dispelled. Each new transformation requires a recasting  of
the spell.

This  spell  was  created by Darklight when he was captain of a  spelljamming
vessel crewed by a mix of plasmoids, lizardmen, xixchil, and hurwaeti. It was
designed in an attempt to keep local populations from being thrown into chaos
at  every  landing.  The  spell  creates  a  subtle  field  of  illusion  and
enchantment  around 2 HD of creatures per caster level, which lasts  for  two
turns per caster level. This field clings to each being touched, whether they
remain  in  a  group  or not, and radiates an insidious message  to  all  who
encounter or view the affected beings. This message reassures onlookers  that
there  is  nothing  out of the ordinary about these beings.  Thus,  the  most
bizarre  of beings may enter crowded groundling cities and not be subject  to
undue  attention  or  attack. A side effect of  this  is  that  all  reaction
modifiers  are  nullified,  negating Charisma and related  bonuses.  When  an
observer is questioned later about a being under the field's protection, they
will  remember  the event precisely, and may become puzzled retroactively  at
their  lack  of reaction beforehand. The magic of the field tends to  prevent
this  realization from becoming traumatic, however. Certain very powerful  or
extraplanar  beings  may not be affected by this spell:  especially  dragons,
demons,  devils,  daemons,  etc. generally will not  sustain  such  a  subtle
camouflage, as their natural aura negates the feeble cloaking of this spell.

This  spell, when cast upon a human or relatively human-sized creature,  will
cause the target's blood to instantly freeze solid. The creature is literally
frozen  in  its tracks, and will die unless certain measures are  taken.  The
stricken creature takes on an icy countenance, tinged strongly with blue. The
reverse  of  this spell, Darklight's blood warm, will re-thaw the  creature's
vital  fluids and allow them a system shock roll at -40%. If they fail,  they
die  from the shock. If they make the roll, they are still incapacitated  for
1d4  days  and  must  rest  in  warm  conditions,  since  they  are  severely
frostbitten.  Unless the reverse is performed within 12  turns  under  normal
conditions of temperature, the creature will die; this can be forestalled  by
keeping them in a below-freezing environment. On a non-frozen creature, blood
warm  has  a  40% chance (+1% per level of the caster) of incapacitating  the
creature from ugly heatstroke for 2d10 turns.

This  amusing  spell calls into being a 4-foot long, faintly glowing  rod  of
force,  with a slim strand of energy hanging off the thin end. On the  handle
end  is  a  crank-type  apparatus, also constructed of this  glowing  energy.
Typically,  the  line is cast into waters where one suspects  interesting  or
valuable  objects  might  be found. The caster then  patiently  waits  for  a
"bite".  Every turn spent fishing gives the caster a number of "bites"  equal
to  one-third  his level (or two, whichever is higher); roll  1d10  for  each
bite.  If  a "7" comes up, it is something along the vague lines of what  the
caster was seeking, based on what the DM decides is actually underwater. Note
that  the  line  does not have to be particularly near the object  (thus  the
conjuration  element), and that the line can lift objects as  if  it  had  an
18/00  Strength, regardless of the wizard's prowess. In especially  treasure-
thick water, there may be bonuses to the roll, left to the discretion of  the
DM. Objects sought for must actually exist and lie within a few thousand feet
of  the casting site. An alternate use of the Rod is for actual fishing, with
chances  as  if  the  wizard  possessed  the  fishing  proficiency,  with  an
additional 25% bonus if he actually does. No bait is needed for this  use  of
the spell.

This  spell  is  a  modified version of wall of force, with several  distinct
changes in its operation and the addition of a slight alteration component to
the  magic. The shape of the force is contoured to surround the caster  at  a
distance of one inch (including possessions); the shape shifts to accommodate
the  wizard's movements, so that the caster is not held in one place.  It  is
also  visible  as a slightly yellow glow, which is brighter at  the  "joints"
when the caster is moving. The caster is reduced to half his movement rate by
the  spell,  and  it  does reduce the wizard's Dexterity while  active,  both
because  of  its slight awkwardness. It is airtight and completely insulating
(as  energy  cannot  penetrate  in  either  direction),  but  the  alteration
component  of the spell keeps fresh, comfortable air quality and  temperature
constant  within the armour. Therefore, not only is force armour an effective
defensive  spell, but it is also the ultimate environmental suit, as  it  can
withstand volcanic lava, the pressure of the sea floor, the positive material
plane,  and  so on. Falling damage is also negated by the armour. However,  a
wizard in force armour cannot cast spells through it at all. Note that  sound
cannot  pass  through it either, so unusual means must be used to  facilitate
communication. It allows a normal level of light to pass through, but not  in
amounts bright enough to blind or damage. Note that the wizard's weapons  are
not  enhanced  by the force' coating. Rather, they are blunted  and  do  less
damage  if  normally  piercing or bladed (-2 d with a  minimum  damage  of  1
point).  In  all  other  respects, it acts as a regular  wall  of  force  (to
determine what attacks can dispel it).

The material component is a diamond cut so as to resemble a miniature person.

This  spell  is a very strange temporal conjuration. It causes  a  quasi-real
double  of  the caster to appear at a place to which the caster is travelling
and make arrangements for his arrival. The time of his arrival cannot be more
than  two weeks away, and the place cannot be more than 300 miles away or  on
anotheplane.  The  destination should be a city, village,  town,  or  trading
post,  not simply an isolated person's house. Even if the caster has no  idea
what exact business he has to do or at what inn he will stay, the double will
"know"  and  will  have  spoken  to  the right  people  and  made  the  right
arrangements.  Therefore, when the caster arrives  and  enters  an  inn,  the
caster's  preferred overnight arrangements will have been worked out;  people
with whom the caster wishes to speak with or trade with will meet him at  the
time the caster realizes he needs to speak or deal with them (if this seems a
bit mind-boggling, realize that it is simply the temporal, quantum nature  of
the spell which causes it to be so). The arrangements cannot be spread over a
time  period of more than three days, and the future self cannot be cast when
the  caster is not going to travel within the spell's time limit.  So,  if  a
caster, planning a trip, casts future self and is then detained for more than
2  weeks, the spell will be cancelled. The caster must "set aside" an  amount
of  money in a sealed pouch or box upon the spell's casting, and it is  in  a
state of flux until the events play themselves out, at which point the proper
change  will  be  left in the container at the end of the  spell's  duration.
Purchases or accommodations costing more than the reserved funds will  simply
be  reserved by the double, unless the caster isn't able to afford them.  The
double  will  only  be  truly  seen  or noticed  by  the  people  with  which
transactions or business arrangements are made, and will not "exist"  in  any
other  localities in the city. The double will not seem strange or unreal  to
those  contacted,  and these persons will realize that it  is  simply  making
"arrangements" for the caster's arrival, however odd that this  may  seem  to
the  ordinary person, it will not disturb these contacted people. The  double
will  not be seen moving through the city streets, as it does not exist apart
from  its mission. When adjudicating this spell, do not worry yourself  about
paradoxes, because it is magic.

To  use this spell, the wizard needs an ordinary quill pen and a piece of new
parchment. When the spell is cast, the pen will rise up and hover for  a  few
seconds,  then  begin writing in a compact, neat script.  No  actual  ink  is
needed,  as the marks are magically inscribed. The script repeats  one  local
rumour (usually one which the caster has not heard, there is a 1-in-10 chance
the caster has actually heard the tale). The pen relates one rumour for every
two  levels the caster possesses. The rumours are ones that are actually told
locally,  either openly or not-so-openly, and their veracity is  not  at  all
guaranteed. The pen will not respond to detect lies or such, as it is  merely
relating  ambient  bits of story, not solid facts. The rumours  usually  only
consist  of  a  couple of sentences, but these tell the main  points  of  the
story. The material component is the quill pen used.

This spell causes multiple twisting strands of thin wire to project from  the
caster's hands. Each strand consists of around ten wires, all tangled  around
each  other. Up to ten strands can be conjured, one per three levels  of  the
wizard,  and each can be directed at individual targets within range and  all
within  an  arc  of 60  in front of the wizard. A strand will  fan  out  upon
striking a target, whipping and twisting around any solid objects to entangle
the  victim. Multiple strands can be targeted on the same victim as  well.  A
target  gets  one  saving throw versus breath weapon per strand,  and  if  it
succeeds, they manage to leap free or remain basically unhindered.  A  failed
saving  throw  results  in the victim becoming horrendously  tangled  in  the
strands. A bend bars roll (at +10%) is needed to escape, but multiple strands
incur  a -10% penalty per extra strand upon the roll. The strands can be  cut
with difficulty, each strand requiring 2d4 rounds in order to be sawn in two.
The  wire  lasts until cut, at which point it winks out of existence  with  a
"sproing" sound.

The material component is a highly twisted bit of steel or iron wire.

This  spell  requires full concentration on the part of the  caster  for  its
entire  duration. For 1 round per two levels of the wizard, a gruesome attack
may  be  carried out. The wizard makes grasping and pulling motions with  his
hands  in  the direction of a single creature within 50 yards, and  rolls  to
hit.  A  successful hit will do 2d4 damage to the creature, as a  handful  of
flesh  is teleported 3-5 feet from the unfortunate's body. One rending attack
may  be  made per round while the spell lasts. The target will begin bleeding
for  2  points  of  damage per "rend" until they receive healing  or  serious
bandaging. The caster also rolls a percentile on each successful hit; if  the
score is equal to or under the caster's level in percentage, the target loses
a vital organ or chunk thereof, and must save versus death magic or expire on
the spot. If the saving throw is successful, they will lapse into a coma, and
can  only  be  revived  by a cure serious wounds or similar  greater  healing
spell; if not so healed, they die within 24 hours. If a target dies or  falls
comatose,  the wizard may move his focus to a new victim, and so on,  for  as
long  as  the spell continues. Use of this spell is not an act in  accordance
with  a  good  alignment. Darklight himself will rarely use it,  due  to  its
ruthlessness.

      Designed  to be used with Darklight's universal digestion (q.v.),  this
spell  creates the culinary illusion that the meal being eaten is very  tasty
indeed.  The  nature of the taste mimicked is up to the caster,  so  a  nasty
taste could be simulated, but in practice is rarely done. The texture of  the
food  is  not changed much, either, so the taste must be logically  connected
somehow.  If  this  spell is used to mask poison, the person  eating  gets  a
saving throw versus spell to notice the taste of the poison. The illusion may
affect  enough  "food" to feed 1 creature per level of the caster,  and  this
effect lasts for 1 turn per five levels of the wizard.

This  spell is an enhanced version of the 7th-level Darklight's force armour.
It is the same as the lower level spell, except as noted.
The   armour  is  less  awkward,  giving  the  wizard  full  normal  movement
capacities,  but still incurring a -1 Dexterity penalty. It also adds  flight
capabilities  to  the armour, with moulded constructs on  the  armour's  back
which project coloured flame (actually jets of force, not fire). These cannot
be  used  to  attack,  but can propel the wizard at MV  36,  MC  C  in  tight
manoeuvring;  over  long distances, it can reach MV  72,  MC  F.  The  flight
capacity of the armour is limited to normal atmospheric flight.
The  arms of the suit are equipped with retractable blades of force, "housed"
above thewizard's forearms and springing forth upon mental command. These act
as  +2  weapons for purposes of what creatures may be hit, and  can  be  used
without  proficiency penalties. One attack with each per round can  be  made,
and on a successful hit do 2d10 cutting damage.
The  armour glows slightly reddish, with brighter areas at the joints; it has
obvious  bumps on the forearms and the back, where bright red jets  of  force
emerge during flight from a squarish force structure.

The material component is a diamond cut so as to resemble a small person,  to
which is affixed a ruby sword and sapphire wings.

This spell is cast upon an inanimate object so that when a being next touches
it,  they  receive  a  clear  and perplexing mental  image  of  the  caster's
choosing. The mental image can be of anything the caster desires, but not  of
any concept requiring more than three words to describe, or of any object  or
creature  specifically. The image could be, for example, a  white  rose,  but
could  not  be a red and blue paisley silken smock manufactured in Calimshan.
The  image  does  not have to be a picture, but can be a  simple  concept  or
feeling,  for  example:  "Doom  lurks here", or:  "Big  apples  yonder".  Any
sufficiently  simple concept can be set into the spell. The  dweomer  remains
passive  within  the object until a creature touches it, at which  point  the
image manifests in their mind. Their reaction may vary: although they may not
associate  the image with the thing touched, they are aware that  a  distinct
"something"  has happened to deliver this mental message. The nature  of  the
image also affects their reactions: the image of a pink bunny rabbit is  less
disturbing than that of a looming skull.
This  spell is often made permanent for various reasons. First, so that every
creature touching an object receives the same image. This is accomplished  by
simply  laying a permanency upon inexplicable image. Secondly,  it  is  often
incorporated  into the enchantments of a magic item (often a sword)  to  give
the item personality.

This spell is cast upon an inanimate object so that when a being next touches
it,  a  limited illusory manifestation of the caster's choosing  occurs.  The
manifestation can be of almost any nature the caster desires, but  cannot  be
designed  to  fool  or scare anyone, as it is clearly some  sort  of  phantom
sensation.  The manifestation can be visual, sonic, or olfactory; it  appears
or  manifests near or around the creature touching the enspelled  object.  It
could be, for example, the image of a white rose, the scent of the ocean,  or
the  sound  of a crying kitten. An image cannot be larger than about  3  feet
across at most, a sound cannot be louder than loud conversation, and a  smell
cannot  incapacitate or choke anyone. The dweomer remains passive within  the
object until a creature touches it, at which point the image manifests. Their
reaction  may vary: although they may not associate the image with the  thing
touched,  they are aware that a distinct "something" has happened to  deliver
this  manifestation  -  usually  this  seems  to  be  some  sort  of  ghostly
phenomenon. The nature of the image also affects their reactions:  the  image
of a pink bunny rabbit is less disturbing than that of a looming skull.
This  spell is often made permanent for various reasons. First, so that every
creature  touching  an  object  causes  the  same  manifestation.   This   is
accomplished  by simply laying a permanency upon inexplicable  manifestation.
Secondly,  it  is often incorporated into the enchantments of  a  magic  item
(often a sword) to give the item personality and flair. A piece of paper with
a colour drawing or detailed description of the manifestation is the material
component.

This  metamagic spell can affect any one spell of fifth level  or  lower.  It
functions  to  cloak all visible effects of the spell, making  it  invisible.
This  has  the effect of reducing its damage by 1 per die (but  not  below  1
point  per  die),  but making it more conducive to stealth.  For  example,  a
fireball  modified by invisible spell would explode with normal noise,  heat,
impact,  and  such, but would be invisible. Note that this does  not  conceal
either  the  caster or the spell's victims, only the visible portion  of  the
spell.  It  adds  3 to the casting time of the other spell, but  requires  no
extra  material  components. The casting of the other spell must  be  started
within the duration of this spell.

This  spell must be anchored as a web spell, and superficially acts  as  one.
However,  the  network  of strands in this spell are  composed  of  crackling
electricity. If it forms around creatures, they take 6d8 electrical damage (a
saving  throw versus breath weapon reduces this to half damage). When caught,
after  the  initial  jolt, they must hold perfectly still  or  risk  breaking
additional  strands  (strands vanish when broken,  but  dispense  damage,  on
average 1d3 per strand). To escape, one can try to move out carefully, making
a  Dexterity check at -4 for each 10 yards moved or taking an additional  2d4
damage  (no saving throw). Creatures "waiting out" the duration must  make  a
Strength  check and a Constitution check at -2 (each) every turn or  fail  to
hold  perfectly  still, taking 2d4 damage (no saving throw).  They  may  then
safely  remain lying where they have collapsed without risking further shock.
Creatures  immune to electrical damage are, of course, immune to the  effects
and  can  break the strands easily and without fear. Large amounts  of  water
sprayed  into  the  web  will  disperse it in a  crackling,  sparking  burst.
However, if anyone is hit by the water as well, they will conduct the spell's
energy, taking 6d10 shock damage. If the water is a stream emanating  from  a
being  (like a water bolt or decanter of endless water), the being must  save
versus  paralysation or suffer the above damage. The material  component  for
this spell is a scale of an electric eel.

This unusual spell gives the caster an elevated view of his surroundings. The
caster must stand still with eyes closed for the duration; he is then able to
look  down from a point hundreds of feet directly above the spot where he  is
standing.  Needless  to  say, the spell's utility is  limited  by  visibility
conditions  -  it  does not grant the ability to see through  trees,  clouds,
smoke, etc. It will not function at all ifcast indoors or underground.  Trees
are  not a barrier to the spell's operation, but it does not lend any special
visual acuity, so fine details of things on the ground may not be picked out.
The duration is limited by caster concentration.
The spell's material component is a looking glass.

This  spell  is  similar to Darklight's planar weapon. It conjures  a  large,
weightless weapon (speed factor 3), such as a two-handed sword or a  polearm,
which can be used in total defiance of any restrictions. It acts as a weapon,
+5  in  every  respect,  and does 5d12 points of special  planar  damage.  To
determine  which  plane its energies are drawn from, roll  on  the  following
table:

     01-50. Elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Air. The weapon can release a gust of wind upon command,  once
every  round, and can keep vaporous creatures at bay. It allows one to attack
aerial  creatures  normally. It does double damage to  earth  or  rock  based
creatures.
          2. Earth. The weapon petrifies a creature on a natural 19 or 20. It
can  carve  a  path through solid rock at a rate of MV 4 per round.  It  does
double  damage to gaseous or aerial creatures, and can attack earth-based  or
rock-like creatures normally.
           3.  Fire. The weapon can emit a path of flame, 3 yards long,  upon
command  (does  burning  hands  damage  as  if  cast  at  twelfth  level   of
experience),  and  can melt ice at the rate of 3 cubic yards  per  round.  It
allows  one to attack flame-based creatures normally, but does double  damage
to liquid creatures, water-based, or cold-using creatures.
           4.  Water. The weapon, if a hit is made on a creature, can attempt
to  "drown" the creature (assuming it is air-breathing) by filling its  lungs
with  water. Thereafter, it must make a successful Constitution check  at  -4
upon  every hit or take an additional 3d10 drowning damage. It can  soak  any
three  adjacent 1-yard squares with water, extinguishing normal  fires,  upon
command.  It  also  allows one to attack liquid creatures normally.  It  does
double damage to fire-based creatures.

     51-60. Para-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Ice.  The  weapon causes a creature to freeze stiff  for  5d10
rounds, taking 4d10 extra damage if it hits on a natural 20. It can freeze up
to  1  cubic  yard  of  liquid per round of touch. It allows  one  to  attack
creatures  of  ice normally, but does double damage to earth-based  and  air-
based creatures.
           2.  Magma.  The  weapon causes items touched  to  melt  or  become
incinerated when it touches them, with no saving throw. On a natural  20,  it
does   quadruple  damage  to  normal  creatures  (quintuple   to   vulnerable
creatures). It allows one to attack lava creatures normally, but does  double
damage to water-based or air-based creatures.
          3. Ooze. The weapon coats a creature with mud and slime, and causes
their lungs to fill up with ooze (they must then make Constitution checks for
10  rounds  or take 2d6 drowning damage per round). It allows one  to  attack
slime  or  ooze creatures normally, but does double damage to fire-based  and
air-based creatures.
           4.  Smoke.  The weapon causes 5d6 extra suffocation  damage  on  a
natural 19 or 20. It can fill six 1-yard squares per round with smoke,  which
functions  as  normal  smoke (the wielder is immune to  negative  effects  of
generated  smoke).  It  allows one to attack mist  or  smoke-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to water or earth-based creatures.

     61-70. Positive quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Lightning. The weapon knocks a creature back up to 15 yards on a
natural 19 or 20, with a clap of thunder and 4d10 extra electrical damage. It
allows one to attack electrical beings normally, and can do double damage  to
metallic,  earth-based,  or water-based creatures.  Also,  it  is  +6  to-hit
against  opponents with metal armour (because it is transmitted through  such
protections).
           2. Minerals. The weapon on a natural 18, 19 or 20 has a 50% chance
of  severing (as a sword of sharpness), otherwise the creature is  petrified.
It  allows one to attack crystalline or mineral creatures normally, but  does
double damage to air-based or particulate (dust or sand) creatures.
           3. Radiance. The weapon turns an undead or shadow-creature, and on
a  natural 19 or 20, blinds a normal creature for 5d10 rounds. It emits light
out  to  a  120-foot radius. It allows one to attack creatures  of  light  or
radiance  normally,  and  does  double damage to  shadow-based  creatures  or
undead.
          4. Steam. The weapon causes a normal creature to pass out from heat
exhaustion, taking 4d8 extra damage, on a natural 19 or 20. It emits  six  1-
yard  squares per round full of vapour (which does not hinder the wielder  at
all).  It allows one to attack mist or vaporous creatures normally, and  does
double  damage  to flame (not purely heat-based) creatures or  to  cold  (not
purely water-based) creatures.

     71-80. Negative quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1. Ash. The weapon causes 5d8 extra cold damage on a natural 19 or
20. It lowers the temperature in a 60-foot radius by 40 F every round (except
the  caster's body temperature). It allows one to attack ash-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to flame or heat-based creatures.
           2.  Dust.  The weapon causes 5d8 extra deterioration damage  on  a
natural  19 or 20. If held in contact with solid material, it breaks  down  1
cubic yard per round of such, leaving behind only fine dust. It allows one to
attack  particulate (sand or dust) creatures normally, and does double damage
to crystalline, rock, or earth-based creatures.
           3.  Salt.  The  weapon causes 5d8 extra dehydration  damage  on  a
natural  19  or 20. If held in contact with organic materials, it  desiccates
them completely in 1 round. It allows one to attack salt elementals normally,
and does double damage to water-based or liquid creatures.
           4. Vacuum. The weapon causes 5d8 decompression damage on a natural
19  or  20. It sucks nine 1-yard squares per round full of air into  oblivion
(the  caster has no problems breathing), creating gale-force winds and having
worse effects in enclosed spaces. It allows one to attack creatures of vacuum
normally, and does double damage to air-based creatures.

     81-90. Border plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1.  Astral.  The  weapon is invisible, but  ignores  all  physical
barriers to attack. It can cut a creature's silver cord on a natural 19 or 20
(assuming  they are projected). It does double damage to creatures  from  the
astral  plane.  A normal creatures isn't able to heal from its wounds  unless
magically healed (as the damage is to the being's aura).
           2.  Ethereal. The weapon is faintly visible as a ghostlike dagger,
but ignores all physical barriers to attack. It attacks ethereal, spirit,  or
in-phase creatures for double damage. A normal creatures isn't able  to  heal
from  its  wounds unless magically healed (as the damage is  to  the  being's
spirit).

     91-95. Material plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1.  Negative material plane. The weapon drains two levels  or  Hit
Dice  of life energon a natural 19 or 20. The weapon has no effect on  undead
creatures,  but does double damage to creatures with a link to  the  positive
material plane.
          2. Positive material plane. The weapon causes its special damage as
healing  to any living being, but if the being is already at full hit points,
this  applies  as "damage". This "damage" is actual, but does  not  count  as
pulling a creature below full hit points in terms of this spell. On a natural
18,  19  or  20, it acts as a mace of disruption versus undead.  Undead  take
double damage in any case from this weapon.

     96-98. Outer plane. Roll 1d20 to determine which:
           1.  Seven  Heavens.  This weapon is gleaming white,  and  radiates
golden  light. It repels evil creatures as a fear spell, 15-yard  radius.  It
does  double damage to chaotic evil creatures, and cannot strike lawful  good
creatures. It can spray holy water upon command in a cone 1-yard base  by  10
yards long with a 5-yard maximum spread.
           2.  Twin  Paradises. This weapon is of entwined silver  and  white
marble.  It  can cure critical wounds three times per summoning  upon  lawful
good  and  neutral  good creatures, and cannot strike such.  It  does  double
damage to chaotic evil and neutral evil creatures.
           3.  Elysium. This weapon is of pure, glowing silver. It  can  turn
undead and evil lycanthropes as a 15th-level priest. It does double damage to
neutral evil creatures, and can disrupt undead creatures on a successful hit,
although it cannot strike neutral good creatures.
          4. Beastlands (Happy Hunting Grounds). This weapon is made of stout
oaken  wood.  It  radiates a 12-yard radius field of animal friendship  aimed
towards the caster. It cannot strike neutral good and chaotic good creatures,
but does double damage to lawful evil and neutral evil creatures. It can cure
critical wounds to any normal plant or animal it touches, once per round.
           5. Olympus. This weapon is made of fine, polished steel. It cannot
strike  chaotic  good  creatures,  but does  double  damage  to  lawful  evil
creatures.  It  can create food and wine upon command, as  the  priest  spell
(cast  at  fifteenth level). It also does damage as if swung by one  with  23
Strength.
           6. Gladsheim. This weapon crackles with lightning and fire, and is
made  of  fine  steel.  It  cannot strike chaotic good  and  chaotic  neutral
creatures,  but  does  double  damage  to  lawful  neutral  and  lawful  evil
creatures. It gives a +5 to-hit and -5 on AC to any chaotic good and  chaotic
neutral warrior within 9 yards.
           7-9.  Limbo. This weapon randomly shifts colour, composition,  and
radiance  every  round. It can strike any creature  who  can  be  hit  by  +5
weapons.  Any  spell effect directed at the wielder is changed  into  a  wild
surge.  It randomly polymorphs any substance or object it touches thrice  per
round, and on a natural 18, 19 or 20 polymorphs a creature randomly. It  does
double damage to lawful neutral creatures.
           10. Pandemonium. This weapon is made of howling wind and darkness.
On a natural 18, 19 or 20, it blinds and confuses (as the spells) its target.
It  cannot strike chaotic neutral and chaotic evil creatures, but does double
damage to lawful neutral and lawful good creatures.
           11.  The Abyss. This weapon drips acid and venom, and is seemingly
composed  of demon-parts. On a natural 18, 19 or 20, it causes the target  to
save  versus poison or take 5d20 poisonous acid damage, regardless of magical
or  natural  resistance  to  poison or acid. It cannot  strike  chaotic  evil
creatures, but does double damage to lawful good creatures.
           12. Tartarus. This weapon is composed of stagnant black liquid. On
a  natural 18, 19 or 20, it causes complete amnesia which can only be removed
by  a  heal  spell. It cannot strike neutral evil and chaotic evil creatures,
but does double damage to lawful good and neutral good creatures.
           13. Hades. This weapon is composed of bone and blood. On a natural
18,  19 or 20, the victim must save versus death magic or be transformed into
an  undead creature. It cannot strike neutral evil creatures, but does double
damage to neutral good creatures.
           14.  Gehenna.  This  weapon is composed of mingled  brimstone  and
shadow.  It  cannot strike neutral evil and lawful evil creatures,  but  does
double damage to neutral good and chaotic good creatures. On a natural 18, 19
or  20,  it  inflicts a rotting disease upon its victim  (as  per  a  mummy's
touch).
          15. Nine Hells. This weapon is composed of fire and brimstone. On a
natural 18, 19 or 20, the creature struck takes 5d20 flame damage, regardless
of  magical  or  natural  resistance to fire. It cannot  strike  lawful  evil
creatures, but does double damage to chaotic good creatures.
           16.  Acheron. This weapon is made of cold iron which glows with  a
red  radiance. On a natural 18, 19 or 20, it paralyses its victim. It  cannot
strike  lawful neutral and lawful evil creatures, but does double  damage  to
chaotic good and chaotic neutral creatures.
           17.  Nirvana. This weapon is perfectly symmetrical along at  least
two  axes, and appears to be made of grey crystal. On a natural 18, 19 or 20,
its  victim  is  held  for  5d10  rounds. It  cannot  strike  lawful  neutral
creatures, but does double damage to chaotic neutral creatures.
           18. Arcadia. This weapon appears to be made of wood which has been
turned into precious metal. When it touches any poison or acid, the latter is
instantly  nullified.  It  cannot  strike  lawful  good  and  lawful  neutral
creatures,  but  does  double  damage to chaotic  neutral  and  chaotic  evil
creatures. It can cure poison when it is touched to any creature, up to  five
times per round.
          19-20. Concordant Opposition. This weapon is of pure white crystal,
fine  steel,  and polished obsidian intertwined. It cannot strike  druids  or
other  creatures  who protect the balance. It does double  damage  to  lawful
good,  chaotic  good,  chaotic evil and lawful  evil  creatures.  Its  attack
ignores  the  defences  of  a  creature whose  powers  are  based  on  strong
alignment, such as demons, paladins, and slaadi.

     99-00. Unusual, demi-planar. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1. Demi-plane of electromagnetism. The weapon is +6 to-hit against
opponents clad in metallic armour. It can repel or attract metal objects with
20 Strength within a 10-yard radius at command. On a natural 20, it knocks an
opponent  back  up to 12 yards for 5d6 extra impact damage.  It  does  double
damage to creatures of a ferrous composition.
           2.  Demi-plane of shadow. The weapon is actually only  quasi-real,
but  appears to be made of solid blackness. A creature struck must disbelieve
or  take  double  actual damage. It does double damage against  creatures  of
light  or any illusory "beings". On a natural 18, 19 or 20, blinds a creature
for 5d8 turns.
           3.  Demi-plane of time. The weapon appears to be simply a wavering
violet  outline. It ages a creature 4 years for each point of damage  accrued
(random  direction, 50% chance each hit of ageing older  or  younger).  On  a
natural 20, it throws an opponent 1d4x1d10 days into the future (or the  past
- at the DM's option).
           4.  DM's option. This can be as strange as you like. It can  be  a
weapon composed of the mists of Ravenloft, of the phlogiston, or of some  far
distant and really bizarre plane of the DM's own devising.

The material component is as with lesser planar weapon.

This  spell can help those afflicted with either natural or magical insanity.
The  spell  will cure one specific insanity if the recipient fails  a  saving
throw versus paralysation (the reason they must fail is that an insane person
tends not to want to be sane). If a being is suffering from multiple forms of
insanity,  it  requires multiple castings. However, only one casting  can  be
attempted each week for a specific individual.

This  spell summons a small weapon composed of planar energies. It  is  solid
and  non-damaging  to  the caster, but its substance is usually  unusual.  It
typically takes the shape of a dagger, but can be any small-sized weapon  the
caster is proficient in. Its base damage is equal to that of a weapon, +1  of
its type, as is its ability to hit, but it does 1d10 points of special damage
based  on  its extraplanar energies. When this spell is cast, roll 1d100  and
consult the table below to see what plane is drawn upon.
Note: when multipliers are given to damage, apply the multiplier only to  the
"special"  planar  damage  of  the  weapon  (1d10,  usually),  and  when  the
description  says that it can attack certain creatures "normally",  then  the
special planar damage does not apply to that creature type.

     01-50. Elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Air. The weapon can disperse 1-yard portions of a cloud of smoke
or  gas  if  swung at them, and can keep vaporous creatures at bay or  attack
aerial  creatures  normally. It does double damage to  earth  or  rock  based
creatures.
           2. Earth. The weapon petrifies a creature on a natural 20, if they
fail a saving throw versus petrification. It does double damage to gaseous or
aerial creatures, and can attack earth-based or rock-like creatures normally.
           3.  Fire.  The  weapon can set any flammable substance  alight  by
merely  touching it, and can melt ice at the rate of 3 cubic feet per  round.
It  allows  one  to attack flame-based creatures normally,  but  does  double
damage to liquid creatures, water-based, or cold-using creatures.
          4. Water. The weapon, if three successive hits are made on a single
creature,  can attempt to "drown" the creature (assuming it is air-breathing)
by  filling  its  lungs  with water. Thereafter, it must  make  a  successful
Constitution  check every hit or take an additional 2d6 drowning  damage.  It
can  extinguish  normal  fires  by touch, and allows  one  to  attack  liquid
creatures normally. It does double damage to fire-based creatures.

     51-60. Para-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Ice. The weapon causes a creature to freeze stiff for 3d4 rounds
and  take 3d4 extra damage if it hits on a natural 20. It can freeze up to  1
gallon of liquid per round of touch. It allows one to attack creatures of ice
normally, but does double damage to earth-based and air-based creatures.
           2.  Magma.  The  weapon  causes items struck  to  melt  or  become
incinerated if they fail a saving throw versus magical fire. On a natural 20,
it   does   triple  damage  to  normal  creatures  (quadruple  to  vulnerable
creatures). It allows one to attack lava creatures normally, but does  double
damage to water-based or air-based creatures.
           3. Ooze. The weapon coats a creature with mud and slime, and on  a
natural  20,  causes their lungs to fill up with ooze (they  must  then  make
Constitution checks for 6 rounds or take 1d6 drowning damage per  round).  It
allows one to attack slime or ooze creatures normally, but does double damage
to fire-based and air-based creatures.
           4.  Smoke.  The weapon causes 2d4 extra suffocation  damage  on  a
natural  20.  It  can  fill  one 1-yard square per round  with  smoke,  which
functions  as  normal  smoke (the wielder is immune to  negative  effects  of
generated  smoke).  It  allows one to attack mist  or  smoke-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to water or earth-based creatures.

     61-70. Positive quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1. Lightning. The weapon knocks a creature back up to 4 yards on a
natural  20,  with  a  clap of thunder and 1d10 extra electrical  damage.  It
allows one to attack electrical beings normally, and can do double damage  to
metallic,  earth-based,  or water-based creatures.  Also,  it  is  +4  to-hit
against  opponents with metal armour (because it is transmitted through  such
protections).
           2. Minerals. The weapon on a natural 20 has a 50 percent chance of
severing  (as a sword of sharpness), otherwise the creature must save  or  be
petrified. It allows one to attack crystalline or mineral creatures normally,
but does double damage to air-based or particulate (dust or sand) creatures.
           3.  Radiance. The weapon turns an undead or shadow-creature  on  a
natural 20, otherwise on a 20 it blinds a normal creature for 2d6 rounds.  It
emits  light  out to a 30-foot radius. It allows one to attack  creatures  of
light  or radiance normally, and does double damage to shadow-based creatures
or undead.
          4. Steam. The weapon causes a normal creature to pass out from heat
exhaustion  on  a natural 20. It emits one 1-yard square per  round  full  of
vapour  (which does not hinder the wielder at all). It allows one  to  attack
mist  or  vaporous creatures normally, and does double damage to  flame  (not
purely heat-based) creatures or to cold (not purely water-based) creatures.

     71-80. Negative quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Ash. The weapon causes 2d6 extra cold damage on a natural 20. It
lowers  the  temperature in a 20-foot radius by 15 F every round (except  the
caster's  body  temperature).  It allows one to  attack  ash-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to flame or heat-based creatures.
           2.  Dust.  The weapon causes 2d6 extra deterioration damage  on  a
natural  20.  If held in contact with solid material, it breaks down  half  a
cubic foot of such per round, leaving behind only fine dust. It allows one to
attack  particulate (sand or dust) creatures normally, and does double damage
to crystalline, rock, or earth-based creatures.
           3.  Salt.  The  weapon causes 2d6 extra dehydration  damage  on  a
natural  20.  If  held in contact with organic materials, it desiccates  them
completely in 2 rounds. It allows one to attack salt elementals normally, and
does double damage to water-based or liquid creatures.
           4. Vacuum. The weapon causes 2d6 decompression damage on a natural
20.  It  sucks  one  1-yard square per round full of air into  oblivion  (the
caster  has  no problems breathing), creating medium winds and  having  worse
effects  in  enclosed  spaces. It allows one to attack  creatures  of  vacuum
normally, and does double damage to air-based creatures.

     81-90. Border plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1.  Astral.  The  weapon is invisible, but  ignores  all  physical
barriers  to  attack. It can cut a creature's silver cord  on  a  natural  20
(assuming  they are projected). It does double damage to creatures  from  the
astral  plane.  A normal creature isn't able to heal from its  wounds  unless
magically healed (as the damage is to the being's aura).
           2.  Ethereal. The weapon is faintly visible as a ghostlike dagger,
but ignores all physical barriers to attack. It attacks ethereal, spirit,  or
in-phase creatures for double damage. A normal creatures isn't able  to  heal
from  its  wounds unless magically healed (as the damage is  to  the  being's
spirit).

     91-95. Material plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1. Negative material plane. The weapon drains one level or Hit Die
of life energy on a natural 20. The weapon has no effect on undead creatures,
but  does  double  damage to creatures with a link to the  positive  material
plane.
          2. Positive material plane. The weapon causes its special damage as
healing  to any living being, but if the being is already at full hit points,
this  applies  as "damage". This "damage" is actual, but does  not  count  as
pulling a creature below full hit points in terms of this spell. On a natural
20,  it acts as a mace of disruption versus undead. Undead take double damage
in any case from this weapon.

     96-98. Outer plane. Roll 1d20 to determine which:
           1.  Seven  Heavens.  This weapon is gleaming white,  and  radiates
golden  light.  It repels evil creatures as a fear spell, 5-yard  r  It  does
double  damage  to  chaotic  evil creatures, and cannot  strike  lawful  good
creatures. It can spray holy water upon command in a cone 5-foot base  by  30
feet long with a 10-foot maximum spread.
           2.  Twin  Paradises. This weapon is of entwined silver  and  white
marble.  It can cure serious wounds once per summoning upon lawful  good  and
neutral  good  creatures, and cannot strike such. It does  double  damage  to
chaotic evil and neutral evil creatures.
           3.  Elysium. This weapon is of pure, glowing silver. It  can  turn
undead and evil lycanthropes as a 9th-level priest. It does double damage  to
neutral evil creatures, and can disrupt undead creatures on a successful hit,
although it cannot strike neutral good creatures.
          4. Beastlands (Happy Hunting Grounds). This weapon is made of stout
oaken  wood.  It  radiates a 3-yard radius field of animal  friendship  aimed
towards the caster. It cannot strike neutral good and chaotic good creatures,
but does double damage to lawful evil and neutral evil creatures. It can cure
light wounds to any normal plant or animal it touches, once per round.
           5. Olympus. This weapon is made of fine, polished steel. It cannot
strike  chaotic  good  creatures,  but does  double  damage  to  lawful  evil
creatures.  It  can create food and wine upon command, as  the  priest  spell
(cast  at  ninth  level). It also does damage as if swung by one  with  18/00
Strength.
           6. Gladsheim. This weapon crackles with lightning and fire, and is
made  of  fine  steel.  It  cannot strike chaotic good  and  chaotic  neutral
creatures,  but  does  double  damage  to  lawful  neutral  and  lawful  evil
creatures. It gives a +2 to-hit and -2 on AC to any chaotic good and  chaotic
neutral warrior within 3 yards.
           7-9.  Limbo. This weapon randomly shifts colour, composition,  and
radiance  every  round. It can strike any creature  who  can  be  hit  by  +3
weapons.  Any  spell effect directed at the wielder is changed  into  a  wild
surge.  It  randomly polymorphs any substance or object it touches  once  per
round,  and  on a natural 20 polymorphs a creature randomly. It  does  double
damage to lawful neutral creatures.
           10. Pandemonium. This weapon is made of howling wind and darkness.
On a natural 20, it blinds and confuses (as the spells) its target. It cannot
strike chaotic neutral and chaotic evil creatures, but does double damage  to
lawful neutral and lawful good creatures.
           11.  The Abyss. This weapon drips acid and venom, and is seemingly
composed of demon-parts. On a natural 20, it causes the target to save versus
poison  or take 2d20 poisonous acid damage, regardless of magical or  natural
resistance  to  poison or acid. It cannot strike chaotic evil creatures,  but
does double damage to lawful good creatures.
           12. Tartarus. This weapon is composed of stagnant black liquid. On
a natural 20, it causes complete amnesia which can only be removed by a heal.
It  cannot  strike neutral evil and chaotic evil creatures, but  does  double
damage to lawful good and neutral good creatures.

20,  the victim must save versus death magic or be transformed into an undead
creature. It cannot strike neutral evil creatures, but does double damage  to
neutral good creatures.
           14.  Gehenna.  This  weapon is composed of mingled  brimstone  and
shadow.  It  cannot strike neutral evil and lawful evil creatures,  but  does
double damage to neutral good and chaotic good creatures. On a natural 20, it
inflicts a rotting disease upon its victim (as per a mummy's touch).
          15. Nine Hells. This weapon is composed of fire and brimstone. On a
natural  20,  the  creature  struck takes 2d20 flame  damage,  regardless  of
magical  or  natural  resistance  to  fire.  It  cannot  strike  lawful  evil
creatures, but does double damage to chaotic good creatures.
           16.  Acheron. This weapon is made of cold iron which glows with  a
red  radiance.  On  a natural 20, it paralyses its victim. It  cannot  strike
lawful  neutral and lawful evil creatures, but does double damage to  chaotic
good and chaotic neutral creatures.
           17.  Nirvana. This weapon is perfectly symmetrical along at  least
two axes, and appears to be made of grey crystal. On a natural 20, its victim
is  held for 2d6 rounds. It cannot strike lawful neutral creatures, but  does
double damage to chaotic neutral creatures.
           18. Arcadia. This weapon appears to be made of wood which has been

creatures.  It  can  cure  poison once per round when  it  is  touched  to  a
creature.
          19-20. Concordant Opposition. This weapon is of pure white crystal,
fine  steel,  and polished obsidian intertwined. It cannot strike  druids  or
other  creatures  who protect the balance. It does double  damage  to  lawful
good,  chaotic  good,  chaotic evil and lawful  evil  creatures.  Its  attack
ignores  the  defences  of  a  creature whose  powers  are  based  on  strong
alignment, such as demons, paladins, and slaadi.

     99-00. Unusual, demi-planar. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1. Demi-plane of electromagnetism. The weapon is +5 to-hit against
opponents clad in metallic armour. It can repel or attract metal objects with
15  Strength within a 3-yard radius at command. On a natural 20, it knocks an

damage to creatures of a ferrous composition.
           2.  Demi-plane of shadow. The weapon is actually only  quasi-real,

past - at the DM's option).
           4.  DM's option. This can be as strange as you like. It can  be  a
weapon composed of the mists of Ravenloft, of the phlogiston, or of some  far

generated,  with  runes representing the various planes of existence  scribed
upon it.

This spell is a favourite of eccentric or showy wizards. The spell calls into
being  an  invisible,  intangible  force  which  is  imbued  with  a  limited
intelligence.  It  is especially receptive to permanency,  with  no  risk  of
losing  Constitution points. The force obeys verbal commands and is  able  to
produce  a  variety of useful, usually mundane objects. It  tends  to  become
confused  if  the request is not specific, however: due to its  comprehensive
knowledge of the multiverse, the request "give me my hat" might result  in  a
black top-hat or a Stetson rather than the wizard's favourite pointy cap.  No
information  about  other  people, places, or things  can  be  surmised  from
quizzing  the  manservant,  however. wizards  who  use  this  spell  tend  to
anthropomorphize the force, carrying on one-sided (to others) arguments  with
it  over  misguided  conjurations, such as  the  Stetson  mentioned  earlier.
Strangely  enough, they speak as if they receive actual replies, even  though
no  other  person  can hear them, and they themselves do not recall  actually
hearing  anything.  Any  conjured object leaving the wizard's  possession  or
which  the  wizard  tells the manservant to get rid of immediately  vanishes.
Conjured  objects are limited in size to no more than 5 pounds or  so;  also,
since  nothing  conjured can be given away and expected to  exist  any  more,
value  matters  little. Also, no magic items, components, weapons,  or  other
offensive  items  may  be  conjured. Alternatively, the  servant  can  "hold"
indefinitely up to 100 pounds wof material or up to 25 items of any sort  for
later  recall. No item held may weigh over 1,000 pounds. These,  being  items
with  actual  existence, are not limited in nature or substance  as  conjured
items  are.  Held  items  vanish completely, but the manservant  will  always
remember  that they are there. The second application is not recommended  for
the  temporary  casting of the spell, because any items still held  when  the
spell  lapses vanish forever. The manservant can be cast onto another  person
(and  even  made permanent), but only if they both are wizards, and  able  to
cast conjuration magic.

      This spell conjures a bolt of pure magical energy, which leaps from the
caster's  outstretched hand out to the stated range instantly. It is coloured
as the wizard desires (normally the wizard's chosen colour). It is impossible
to  damage inanimate matter with this spell, as it can affect only two  sorts
of targets: living beings and magical effects.

     Living beings are automatically struck by the spell, but can save versus
spell  for half damage. The base damage of this spell is a flat 3 points  per
level  of  the  caster. It does not leave a physical wound,  as  it  directly
attacks  the life energy of the victim (not in a necromantic way, but through
mystic energy damage). In this regard, it ignores armour and shields.

     Magical effects, including conjured matter, magical shields, golems, and
other  magical effects with physical existence, can be targeted.  Golems  and
magically  animated  things  can be dealt damage  directly,  with  no  saving
throws.  Magical shielding spells are reduced in duration by ¬ per 10  points
of mystic bolt damage inflicted if no spell damage threshold is listed in the
description of the shielding spell.

      This spell will not damage a wall of force or prismatic sphere. Effects
of  a mystic bolt on lesser protective spells and magical armour are left  to
the judgement of the DM.

      This spell can be used to block magical attacks, being a shield of pure
protective energy. It is coloured as the wizard desires (usually the wizard's
chosen  colour), and can be manoeuvred to block any portion of  the  wizard's
body.

      Area effect spells cannot be blocked unless the wizard is at the centre
(targeted point) of the spell's area, in which case it is treated as a normal
spell.  The shield can absorb up to 5 points of magical damage per two levels
of  the caster before being destroyed. Magical missiles, bolts, rays, and  so
forth can be blocked with a successful Intelligence check, and do full damage
to the shield (any excess damage penetrates to the caster). Other spells do 8
points of damage to the shield per level of the spell (for example, a blocked
flesh to stone does 48 points to the shield; if such a spell penetrates  with
"excess damage", the caster saves versus its effect with a +4 bonus).

     The mystic shield will not block physical attacks at all. A magical bolt
of  force,  although it has a physical manifestation, is magical energy,  and
would  be  An arrow enchanted with flame arrow would not be blocked, but  any
targeting  bonuses gained from magical energy (including plusses  on  magical
arrows) are only half as effective when blocked by a shield (round down).

This spell can be emplaced upon any other spell with an area of effect stated
as  "The caster" (a "personal" spell). It acts to protect the magical  effect
from  hostile or accidental dispel magic spells. It adds +50% to the  chances
of  it  resisting  a dispel magic. Note that this does not  affect  any  area
effect spell: it only affects those spells which affect the caster only.  The
shield only lasts as long as the personal spell's normal duration lasts,  and
can  only protect a single personal spell per casting. The material component
is a 500 gp diamond.

This  rather  ruthless  spell may be targeted upon one  intelligent  creature
within range. Only non-humanoid creatures get a saving throw versus spell  to
avoid  the  spell's effects, as their minds are harder to  "lock  onto".  The
target  of  the  spell,  and no one else, sees a glowing  sledgehammer  which
strikes  him on the head. The target's psyche immediately splits  into  2d4+1
separate  personalities,  each  having a 30%  chance  of  being  insane,  the
original  personality  not counted in that number, but  still  in  existence.
Their  alignments, nicknames, and insanity should be then determined randomly
by  the  DM.  The target has a 20% chance of being stunned for  four  rounds,
otherwise a random personality takes control within one round. The victim can
fight the spell over the long run: for each week of this malady, the original
personality may make a saving throw versus death magic to remove  one  random
personality. Otherwise, the insanity works like the standard form,  with  the
normal chances for random switching.

The  material  component is a small silver hammer, with  the  word  "Maxwell"
inscribed upon it.

This  spell  summons a bubble of material from one of the inner  planes.  Any
creatures  caught inside this bubble will suffer the effects  of  unprotected
exposure to the plane in question (unless, of course, they possess applicable
protection).  A  saving throw versus breath weapon may  be  made  during  the
second  round to jump clear. Anyone failing this saving throw cannot  escape,
as  the  bubble's  boundary solidifies; at this point, only a  dispel  magic,
disintegrate, or similar spell can destroy the bubble. There is  a  base  10%
chance  of accidentally catching a creature native to the elemental plane  in
question inside the bubble. It will usually react in a hostile and aggressive
manner.  The  bubble  can  be  of any elemental,  para-elemental,  or  quasi-
elemental  plane, not including those of time, electromagnetism,  shadow,  or
the  positive or negative material planes. The material component is a  small
sample  of  the material desired (in the case of lightning, vacuum, radiance,
magma,  etc.,  some creativity must be exercised, and the DM must  rule  what
counts as a sample).

This  spell  creates a violent plume of planar energies which  erupt  from  a
solid  surface within range. Each plume has a base 2 yards across, and shoots
5 yards into the air. The energies last for at least 5 rounds, but may remain
if  of  a  solid, stable nature. Creatures in the area described suffers  the
effects of the plume, as detailed below. The plane whose energies are  called
upon is determined by random roll (it is wild magic) on the table below:

     01-60. Elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Air. This plume manifests as a titanic surge of swirling wind,
much like an upended tornado. Its force is directed upward, however, and does
not  trap creatures. Creatures making a saving throw versus breath weapon are
thrown  3  yards horizontally for 3d6 damage; those failing are  hurled  high
into the air. Large and greater creatures only thrown 10 yards upwards, while
medium  and small or tiny creatures are thrown 20 yards straight up, and  may
suffer  appropriate falling damage. It has double effect  on  earth  or  rock
based creatures. This disperses upon the duration's end.
           2. Earth. This plume manifests as a tapering column of solid stone
which  impacts forcefully through anything in the area. It does  6d10  impact
damage  (half  if a creature saves) and creatures failing their saving  throw
fall  off  the column (taking appropriate falling damage in all probability).
It does double damage to gaseous or aerial creatures, but these are of course
not subject to falling damage. The stone summoned is relatively permanent.
           3.  Fire. This plume is a tremendously hot column of roaring fire.
It does 8d8 flame damage to all within its area (save for half damage). Those
who fail a second saving throw are overcome, and remain trapped for another 2
rounds  of damage, at the end of which they obtain a third saving throw.  The
fire does double damage to liquid, water-based, or cold-using creatures.
           4.  Water. This plume is a vertical, gushing stream of pressurized
water.  Creatures weighing less than 3 tons are carried up to  its  apex  and
must  save  versus  breath weapon or be thrown off. Creatures  hit  take  7d4
impact damage and may take falling damage if their saving throw is failed. It
soaks  adjacent  areas with water, extinguishing normal fires  and  generally
causing  all  the  problems which a massive inflow of  water  would  normally
cause. It does double damage to fire-based creatures.

     61-75. Para-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Ice. This plume is a glittering, edged spire of ice. Creatures
in  its  area upon conjuration must save or become trapped inside the forming
ice.  Creatures trapped are unable to escape without outside help (unless  of
Strength  20 or greater), and take 2d4 freezing damage (and suffocation)  per
round. Creatures who make their saving throw take 2d6 cold and cutting damage
as the spire slashes by them. The ice remains as long as it does not melt (in
normal climates, this is actually several days, making it imperative to  free
trapped companions immediately). It does double damage to earth-based and air-
based creatures.
          2. Magma. This plume sends a column of red-hot lava and half molten
rock  shooting  into the air. Creatures within the area suffer  the  combined
effects of the fire and earth plumes, without the danger of becoming trapped.
However,  creatures  remaining on its apex continue to take  full  fire-plume
damage  unless they leap free. It does double damage to water-based  or  air-
based creatures.
           3.  Ooze. This plume is a colossal stream of mud and slime. It has
the  negative side effects of a water-plume (filling the area with ooze), and
does  6d4  impact damage. Creatures who make a saving throw are thrown  clear
(from  50  feet up), but those who fail are entrapped in the stream  of  ooze
(which  is less rapid than the water-plume). Entrapped creatures must make  a
Constitution  check  at -5 each round or take 2d6 drowning  damage.  It  does
double damage to fire-based and air-based creatures.
           4.  Smoke. This plume is a gale-force blast of smoke. It  has  the
throwing  damage potential of an air-plume, but begins to fill the area  with
thick,  black  smoke. In an open area, the smoke rises and simply  creates  a
huge  cloud of smoke in the sky, but in an enclosed space, it fills a  15x15-
foot  area  with  smoke per round, which spreads as far as  possible.  Smoke-
filled  areas  may  cause blindness and suffocation (see the  Manual  of  the
Planes  for  smoke inhalation). It does double damage to water or earth-based
creatures.

     76-85. Quasi-elemental plane (positive). Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Lightning.  This  plume  is  a  massive  column  of  crackling
lightning,  which emanates a strong smell of ozone upon its  appearance.  Any
creature takes 8d8 electrical damage if hit by it. It knocks a creature  back
up to 15 yards (depending on size) if they are caught near its centre, with a
clap  of  thunder  and 4d10 extra electrical damage. It  does  no  damage  to
electrical  beings,  but  can do double damage to metallic,  earth-based,  or
water-based creatures. It is transmitted by 2d6 arcs to any large  source  of
metal  or magnetism (anything larger than a longsword) within 20 feet of  its
area.
           2.  Minerals.  The  plume  is a huge agglomeration  of  multi-hued
crystals  and  minerals. It impacts as an earth plume, albeit with  an  extra
1d20  cutting  damage from sharp angles, but a creature failing their  saving
throw must save again versus polymorph or otherwise become petrified. It does
no  damage  to  crystalline or mineral creatures normally,  but  does  double
damage to air-based or particulate (dust or sand) creatures.
           3.  Radiance.  This  plume  destroys  mindless  undead  or  shadow
creatures,  and  does double damage and turn any greater creatures  of  these
types.  Normal  creatures caught in it are blinded for 5d10 rounds  and  take
3d10  burn damage. It emits shimmering, multicoloured light out to a  10-yard
radius. It does no damage to creatures of light or radiance.
           4.  Steam. The plume has the throwing damage potential of  an  air
plume,  but a creature failing a second Constitution roll pass out from  heat
exhaustion,  taking 4d8 extra damage. It emits 15x15 feet full of  steam  per
round (which does not retain the immense heat as above). It does no damage to
mist  or  vaporous creatures normally, but does double damage to  flame  (not
purely heat-based) creatures or to cold (not purely water-based) creatures.

     86-95. Quasi-elemental plane (negative). Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Ash. The plume has a chance of entrapping a creature as an ice
plume,  but  does not cause cutting damage. It has identical cold  properties
(due  to  its  heat-leeching  effect) and does  2d8  impact.  It  lowers  the
temperature in a 12-yard radius by 40 F every round (except the caster's body
temperature).  It  does  no damage to ash-based creatures,  but  does  double
damage to flame or heat-based creatures.
           2. Dust. The plume simply does 3d20 deterioration damage to anyone
caught  in  it.  Fine  dust  spreads over a 140-foot  area  nearby,  possibly
obscuring vision. Prolonged contact with solid material breaks down  6  cubic
yards  of  such  per round, leaving behind only fine dust. It  no  damage  to
particulate  (sand  or dust) creatures normally, but does  double  damage  to
crystalline, rock, or earth-based creatures.
           3.  Salt.  The plume does damage as a minerals plume, except  that
creatures  failing their saving throw versus polymorph take 2d10  desiccation
damage from water loss. If organic materials are left in contact with it, the
plume  desiccates  them  completely in 1 round. It does  no  damage  to  salt
elementals  normally,  but  does  double  damage  to  water-based  or  liquid
creatures.
           4.  Vacuum. The plume sucks everything within 8 yards towards  its
centre with a Strength of 20. Creatures caught wit upon formation suffer  7d6
decompression damage. It sucks fifteen 1-yard squares per round full  of  air
into oblivion, creating gale-force winds and having worse effects in enclosed
spaces.  It  does no damage to creatures of vacuum normally, but does  double
damage to air-based creatures.

      95-00.  Strangeness.  A border planar, positive  or  negative  material
planar,  outer  planar,  or demi-planar plume. The DM  must  determine  which
plane, and what exactly the energy from the selected plane will do.

The  material  component  is a pot containing residue  collected  from  slain
creatures from three separate planes.

This  spell is similar to Darklight's minor planar weapon, but it conjures  a
medium-sized weapon no larger than a staff or longsword, of a type the caster
is  proficient in. It acts as a weapon, +3 in all respects, save that it does
3d6  extra damage of special planar type. The plane whose energies are  drawn
upon is determined below:

     01-50. Elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Air. The weapon can release a gust of wind upon command, one per
three  rounds, and can thus keep vaporous creatures at bay. It allows one  to
attack  aerial  creatures normally. It does double damage to  earth  or  rock
based creatures.
           2.  Earth. The weapon petrifies a creature on a natural 20. It can
cleave  through rock and soil with ease. It does double damage to gaseous  or
aerial creatures, and can attack earth-based or rock-like creatures normally.
           3. Fire. The weapon can emit a burst of flame into any adjacent 1-
yard  space upon command (this does burning hands damage as if cast at  ninth
level of experience), and can melt ice at the rate of 1 cubic yard per round.
It  allows  one  to attack flame-based creatures normally,  but  does  double
damage to liquid creatures, water-based, or cold-using creatures.
           4.  Water. The weapon, if two successive hits are made on a single
creature,  can  attempt to "d the creature (assuming it is air-breathing)  by
filling  its  lungs  with  water.  Thereafter,  it  must  make  a  successful
Constitution  check at -4 upon every hit or take an additional  2d8  drowning
damage.  It  can  soak  any adjacent 1-yard square with water,  extinguishing
normal  fires,  upon command. It also allows one to attack  liquid  creatures
normally. It does double damage to fire-based creatures.

     51-60. Para-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1.  Ice.  The  weapon causes a creature to freeze  stiff  for  4d8
rounds, taking 3d8 extra damage if it hits on a natural 20. It can freeze  up
to  10  cubic  feet  of liquid per round of touch. It allows  one  to  attack
creatures  of  ice normally, but does double damage to earth-based  and  air-
based creatures.
           2.  Magma.  The  weapon causes items touched  to  melt  or  become
incinerated when it touches them, with only magical items obtaining a  saving
throw.  On a natural 20, it does triple damage to normal creatures (quadruple
to  vulnerable  creatures). It allows one to attack lava creatures  normally,
but does double damage to water-based or air-based creatures.
          3. Ooze. The weapon coats a creature with mud and slime, and causes
its lungs to fill up with ooze (they must then make Constitution checks for 6
rounds or take 1d6 drowning damage per round). It allows one to attack  slime
or  ooze  creatures normally, but does double damage to fire-based  and  air-
based creatures.
           4.  Smoke.  The weapon causes 3d6 extra suffocation  damage  on  a
natural  20.  It  can fill three 1-yard squares per round with  smoke,  which
functions  as  normal  smoke (the wielder is immune to  negative  effects  of
generated  smoke).  It  allows one to attack mist  or  smoke-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to water or earth-based creatures.

     61-70. Positive quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Lightning. The weapon knocks a creature back up to 10 yards on a
natural 20, with a clap of thunder and 3d8 extra electrical damage. It allows
one  to  attack  electrical beings normally, and  can  do  double  damage  to
metallic,  earth-based,  or water-based creatures.  Also,  it  is  +4  to-hit
against  opponents with metal armour (because it is transmitted through  such
protections).
           2. Minerals. The weapon on a natural 20 has a 50 percent chance of
severing  (as a sword of sharpness), otherwise the creature is petrified.  It
allows  one  to  attack crystalline or mineral creatures normally,  but  does
double damage to air-based or particulate (dust or sand) creatures.
           3. Radiance. The weapon turns an undead or shadow-creature, and on
a  natural 20, blinds a normal creature for 4d8 rounds. It emits light out to
a  90-foot  radius.  It allows one to attack creatures of light  or  radiance
normally, and does double damage to shadow-based creatures or undead.
          4. Steam. The weapon causes a normal creature to pass out from heat
exhaustion,  taking 2d8 extra damage, on a natural 20. It emits three  1-yard
squares per round full of vapour (which does not hinder the wielder at  all).
It  allows one to attack mist or vaporous creatures normally, and does double
damage  to  flame  (not purely heat-based) creatures or to cold  (not  purely
water-based) creatures.

     71-80. Negative quasi-elemental plane. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
          1. Ash. The weapon causes 4d6 extra cold damage on a natural 20. It
lowers  the  temperature in a 40-foot radius by 25 F every round (except  the
caster's  body  temperature).  It allows one to  attack  ash-based  creatures
normally, and does double damage to flame or heat-based creatures.
           2.  Dust.  The weapon causes 4d6 extra deterioration damage  on  a
natural 20. If held in contact with solid material, breaks down 2 cubic  feet
of  such  per round, leaving behind only fine dust. It allows one  to  attack
particulate  (sand  or dust) creatures normally, and does  double  damage  to
crystalline, rock, or earth-based creatures.
           3.  Salt.  The  weapon causes 4d6 extra dehydration  damage  on  a
natural  20.  If  held  in  contact with organic materials,  desiccates  them
completely in 1 round. It allows one to attack salt elementals normally,  and
does double damage to water-based or liquid creatures.
           4. Vacuum. The weapon causes 4d6 decompression damage on a natural
20. It sucks 4 1-yard squares per round full of air into oblivion (the caster
has  no problems breathing), creating high winds and having worse effects  in
enclosed  spaces. It allows one to attack creatures of vacuum  normally,  and
does double damage to air-based creatures.

     81-90. Border plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1.  Astral.  The  weapon is invisible, but  ignores  all  physical
barriers  to  attack. It can cut a creature's silver cord  on  a  natural  20
(assuming  they are projected). It does double damage to creatures  from  the
astral  plane.  A normal creature isn't able to heal from its  wounds  unless
magically healed (as the damage is to the being's aura).
           2.  Ethereal. The weapon is faintly visible as a ghostlike dagger,
but ignores all physical barriers to attack. It attacks ethereal, spirit,  or
in-phase creatures for double damage. A normal creatures isn't able  to  heal
from  its  wounds unless magically healed (as the damage is  to  the  being's
spirit).

     91-95. Material plane. Roll 1d2 to determine which:
           1.  Negative material plane. The weapon drains two levels  or  Hit
Dice  of  life  energy on a natural 20. The weapon has no  effect  on  undead
creatures,  but does double damage to creatures with a link to  the  positive
material plane.
          2. Positive material plane. The weapon causes its special damage as
healing  to any living being, but if the being is already at full hit points,
this  applies  as "damage". This "damage" is actual, but does  not  count  as
pulling a creature below full hit points in terms of this spell. On a natural
19  or  20, it acts as a mace of disruption versus undead. Undead take double
damage in any case from this weapon.

     96-98. Outer plane. Roll 1d20 to determine which:
           1.  Seven  Heavens.  This weapon is gleaming white,  and  radiates
golden  light. It repels evil creatures as a fear spell, 10-yard  radius.  It
does  double damage to chaotic evil creatures, and cannot strike lawful  good
creatures. It can spray holy water upon command in a cone 10-foot base by  50
feet long with a 30-foot maximum spread.
           2.  Twin  Paradises. This weapon is of entwined silver  and  white
marble. It can cure serious wounds three times per summoning upon lawful good
and neutral good creatures, and cannot strike such. It does double damage  to
chaotic evil and neutral evil creatures.
           3.  Elysium. This weapon is of pure, glowing silver. It  can  turn
undead and evil lycanthropes as a 12th-level priest. It does double damage to
neutral evil creatures, and can disrupt undead creatures on a successful hit,
although it cannot strike neutral good creatures.
          4. Beastlands (Happy Hunting Grounds). This weapon is made of stout
oaken  wood.  It  radiates a 6-yard radius field of animal  friendship  aimed
towards the caster. It cannot strike neutral good and chaotic good creatures,
but does double damage to lawful evil and neutral evil creatures. It can cure
serious wounds to any normal plant or animal it touches, once per round.
           5. Olympus. This weapon is made of fine, polished steel. It cannot
strike  chaotic  good  creatures,  but does  double  damage  to  lawful  evil
creatures.  It  can create food and wine upon command, as  the  priest  spell
(cast  at  twelfth level). It also does damage as if swung  by  one  with  21
Strength.
           6. Gladsheim. This weapon crackles with lightning and fire, and is
made  of  fine  steel.  It  cannot strike chaotic good  and  chaotic  neutral
creatures,  but  does  double  damage  to  lawful  neutral  and  lawful  evil
creatures. It gives a +4 to-hit and -4 on AC to any chaotic good and  chaotic
neutral warrior within 4 yards.
           7-9.  Limbo. This weapon randomly shifts colour, composition,  and
radiance  every  round. It can strike any creature  who  can  be  hit  by  +4
weapons. Any spell effect directed at the wielder changes into a wild  surge.
It  randomly polymorphs any substance or object it touches twice  per  round,
and  on  a  natural 19 or 20 polymorphs a creature randomly. It  does  double
damage to lawful neutral creatures.
           10.  Pande This weapon is made of howling wind and darkness. On  a
natural  19  or  20, it blinds and confuses (as the spells)  its  target.  It
cannot  strike  chaotic neutral and chaotic evil creatures, but  does  double
damage to lawful neutral and lawful good creatures.
           11.  The Abyss. This weapon drips acid and venom, and is seemingly
composed of demon-parts. On a natural 19 or 20, it causes the target to  save
versus  poison or take 3d20 poisonous acid damage, regardless of  magical  or
natural  resistance  to  poison  or  acid.  It  cannot  strike  chaotic  evil
creatures, but does double damage to lawful good creatures.
           12. Tartarus. This weapon is composed of stagnant black liquid. On
a natural 19 or 20, it causes complete amnesia which can only be removed by a
heal.  It  cannot  strike neutral evil and chaotic evil creatures,  but  does
double damage to lawful good and neutral good creatures.
           13. Hades. This weapon is composed of bone and blood. On a natural
19  or 20, the victim must save versus death magic or be transformed into  an
undead  creature. It cannot strike neutral evil creatures,  but  does  double
damage to neutral good creatures.
           14.  Gehenna.  This  weapon is composed of mingled  brimstone  and
shadow.  It  cannot strike neutral evil and lawful evil creatures,  but  does
double damage to neutral good and chaotic good creatures. On a natural 19  or
20, it inflicts a rotting disease upon its victim (as per a mummy's touch).
          15. Nine Hells. This weapon is composed of fire and brimstone. On a
natural 19 or 20, the creature struck takes 3d20 flame damage, regardless  of
magical  or  natural  resistance  to  fire.  It  cannot  strike  lawful  evil
creatures, but does double damage to chaotic good creatures.
           16.  Acheron. This weapon is made of cold iron which glows with  a
red  radiance.  On  a natural 19 or 20, it paralyses its  victim.  It  cannot
strike  lawful neutral and lawful evil creatures, but does double  damage  to
chaotic good and chaotic neutral creatures.
           17.  Nirvana. This weapon is perfectly symmetrical along at  least
two  axes, and appears to be made of grey crystal. On a natural 19 or 20, its
victim is held for 3d6 rounds. It cannot strike lawful neutral creatures, but
does double damage to chaotic neutral creatures.
           18. Arcadia. This weapon appears to be made of wood which has been
turned into precious metal. When it touches any poison or acid, the latter is
instantly  nullified.  It  cannot  strike  lawful  good  and  lawful  neutral
creatures,  but  does  double  damage to chaotic  neutral  and  chaotic  evil
creatures.  It  can  cure poison twice per round when it is  touched  to  any
creature.
          19-20. Concordant Opposition. This weapon is of pure white crystal,
fine  steel,  and polished obsidian intertwined. It cannot strike  druids  or
other  creatures  who protect the balance. It does double  damage  to  lawful
good,  chaotic  good,  chaotic evil and lawful  evil  creatures.  Its  attack
ignores  the  defences  of  a  creature whose  powers  are  based  on  strong
alignment, such as demons, paladins, and slaadi.

     99-00. Unusual, demi-planar. Roll 1d4 to determine which:
           1. Demi-plane of electromagnetism. The weapon is +5 to-hit against
opponents clad in metallic armour. It can repel or attract metal objects with
17  Strength  within a 5-yard radius at command. On a natural 20,  it  knocks
back  an  opponent up to 8 yards for 3d6 extra impact damage. It does  double
damage to creatures of a ferrous composition.
           2.  Demi-plane of shadow. The weapon is actually only  quasi-real,
but  appears to be made of solid blackness. A creature struck must disbelieve
or  take  double  actual damage. It does double damage against  creatures  of
light or any illusory "beings". On a natural 19 or 20, blinds a creature  for
3d6 turns.
           3.  Demi-plane of time. The weapon appears to be simply a wavering
violet  outline. It ages a creature 2 years for each point of damage  accrued
(random  direction, 50% chance each hit of ageing older  or  younger).  On  a
natural 20, throws an opponent 1d4x1d100 turns into the future (or the past -
at the DM's option).
           4.  DM's option. This can be as strange as you like. It can  be  a
weapon composed of the mists of Ravenloft, of the phlogiston, or of some far-
distant and really bizarre plane of the DM's own devising.

The material component is as with lesser planar weapon.

This spell is similar in some ways to both a wish and a curse. It is cast  by
the  wizard  reciting a self-composed poem, directed at a person,  place,  or
thing at which he wishes to direct some sort of vengeance.
The  target in question must be truly the one which the wizard has reason  to
hate, so that a framed person may not be affected by the poetic justice.  The
vengeance  may  be  petty, however, so that innocents  might  be  endangered.
However, this is not likely due to the extreme nature of the spell.
The duration, range, and area of effect are as per wish. However, the casting
time  is much greater. The wizard must recite the poem loudly in the presence
of  the  open  sky for it to take effect, and depending on the power  of  the
curse, this might take some time.
The  poem's  length and complexity are determined by how powerful the  wizard
wishes  his  revenge  to be. The degree to which the described  vengeance  is
carried  out  by the spell is proportional to the craftsmanship of  the  said
poem. Note that this gives DMs some leeway in interpretation.
If  the  poem's target is true and its poetic power is sufficient,  then  the
things  described  in the poem take place. One specific  curse  or  permanent
effect  (each  considered a "term", as in a contract) can be caused  per  two
levels of the wizard, dependent upon the above factors. Note that this  is  a
maximum effect for a single poem, and that a lesser effect can be visited.
The  price for casting the spell is dire. For each term set within the  poem,
the  wizard  suffers  one  day of reduced power, being  reduced  to    normal
casting level with regards to number and level of spells memorised as well as
internal spell variables such as range.

This  spell is used to ready another spell for instantaneous casting in tight
situations.  It  can be used with any spell of fifth level  or  lower,  whose
casting  time is less than 1 turn. The spell is cast ahead of time,  with  an
extra  round added to the casting time, and with normal components  consumed.
The  dweomer is then held "ready" and can be loosened at any time the  wizard
wills. Note that the spell still occupies a "slot" in the caster's memory.
The  readied  spell  has normal duration, area of effect, range,  and  saving
throw,  but  the  casting  time  is reduced  to  effectively  zero  upon  its
triggering. The metamagic can only affect one lesser spell, and requires  the
additional component of a miniature golden cage with a swinging door (no less
than 300 gp cost).

This   spell  creates  a  red,  starlike  ball  of  energy  in  the  wizard's
outstretched  hand,  which  darts out at the  specified  target  as  a  magic
missile.  It  does 2d12 points of damage (+1 HP per level of the caster).  It
will  dispel  the  spells  armour, shield, wall  of  force,  minor  globe  of
invulnerability, and, at the DM's option, other spells. If the  redstar  hits
such  a spell, it will be weakened and only deal 1d6 points of damage to  the
(formerly)  protected  creature. When struck  by  an  unweakened  redstar,  a
spellcasting  creature must save versus paralysation  at  -4  or  immediately

This  Metamagic  spell will alter the course of a single bolt-  or  ray-class
spell  of up to seventh level into the shape of a ring. The casting  time  of
the  secondary spell is added to the 2 required to frame the Metamagic spell.
When  the bolt is cast, the caster chooses the point of origin as usual,  and
the  bolt  then  arcs  outward in a circular path. If the  bolt's  length  is
sufficient,  it  will form a circle with a radius of at least  20  feet.  The
caster  has  several  choices when framing the magic: if  the  bolt's  length
allows for a circle of with a circumference of more than 20 feet, then it can
either be made to loop several times in this 20 feet circumference path or it
can  be made to form a larger ring. The DM may require that the ring's radius
be made an even 10-foot multiple or the bolt will take the standard radius.
Also,  the  caster  must  decide the orientation  of  the  ring.  In  outdoor
conditions,  many interesting vertical or diagonal possibilities  exist,  but
the  ring  should  not  be made to bounce off walls - this  would  break  the
metamagic's  control, and the bolt wicareen in random directions,  picking  a
new direction every 20 feet as per the grenade scattering chart.
If  the bolt is cast in a manner similar to lightning bolt, then the ring can
start  anywhere within range of the normal casting. However, some bolts begin
from the caster's outstretched hand; in this case, the metamage can delay the
ring's firing by 1d4, enough for the caster (only the caster, other creatures
should  have no idea what he is doing) to jump back out of the ring's  ending
point.
Note  that  this spell cannot extend the normal length of such a bolt.  If  a
bolt's length is not sufficient to finish a 20-foot circumference path,  than
it will not loop completely around.

This  spell  causes  the  wizard to be surrounded by an  invisible  field  of
alteration  magic,  which causes anything he touches  to  become  unnaturally
resilient  and rubbery. In effect, anything which comes in contact  with  the
wizard  becomes as bouncy, stretchable, and rubbery as detailed in the lesser
spell  Darklight's rubbery transformation. However, these  things  return  to
normal when they are outside of the wizard's contact. Large objects are  only
rubbery in a local area around the wizard's touch (a 3-foot radius).
This allows the wizard to bend bars open, bounce on the ground like it was  a
trampoline,  and ignore all purely physical damage. A sword blow flexes  into
uselessness when it hits the wizard, and is "sproinged" right off  his  body.
See rubbery transformation for details.

The material component is the sap of a strange tropical tree.

This  spell  transforms  the  caster temporarily  so  that  he  is  extremely
flexible,  bouncy, and rubbery. Blunt weapons, impact, and falling damage  do
not affect him in this state, but knock the wizard 1 yard per point of damage
over  5 points in the direction opposite to that from which the attack  came.
Falling  damage  causes the caster to bounce in a random direction  (use  the
grenade-like missile chart), one yard for every 20 feet fallen.
The  caster  can attempt to control the direction of his bounces (off  walls,
floors, ceilings, people) by making a Dexterity check at -5 upon impact  (but
only if he sees it coming). Bladed or piercing weapons do -2 points of damage
per die, with the possibility of no damage inflicted. Magical attacks may  or
may  not injure the caster: heat, cold, and most energy damages him normally,
but force attacks are resisted as blunt weapons.
The  wizard's  equipment  is  transformed in the same  fashion,  and  remains
rubbery  as  long  as he does. If the wizard bounces into  a  person  with  a
velocity of more than MV 10, he may do damage or knock them over, at the DM's
discretion.

The material component is a chicken bone, boiled to flexibility.

This  spell  conjures a white-hot, 6-foot wide floating  disk  of  iron.  The
caster can manoeuvre the disk about at a rate of MV 20 by mental command. The
disk  cannot  be  moved  farther than the above range,  and  can  be  stopped
instantly, as if without any inertia, by the caster's command. It can be used
to  strike  and pummel creatures within range, needing no roll  to  hit.  The
intended  target  gets  a  saving throw versus breath  weapon  to  dodge  it,
otherwise they take 6d6 from the impact and heat.
If  used  to  pin a creature down, the victim receives a saving throw  versus
breath  weapon at +3, failure indicating that they are trapped by  the  disk,
taking 8d6 damage per round from pressure and searing damage. Only disruption
of  the  wizard's concentration can free the trapped creature if  the  wizard
does not free them himself.
Creatures  resistant  to  heat  and fire  take  only  half  damage  from  any
application  of the disk. Disruption of the wizard's concentration  does  not
cause  the disk to disappear, but merely to hang motionless until the  wizard
resumes active control. Any cold-based attack or spell of more than 5 dice of
damage  directed  at the disk causes it to shatter from thermodynamic  shock,
instantly ending the spell.

The material component is a cast iron skillet.

This  pulse  of force, sound, and wind can be emitted when the caster  swings
his arms (or, optionally, his staff). This action causes a thunderous wave of
force  along  a  50 foot long path; it is 30 feet wide at its beginning,  but
expands to 100 feet wide at the end of its travel. The force will knock  back
creatures caught in it as follows:

This  metamagic spell can affect any one spell of fifth level  or  lower.  It
functions  to cloak all visible and audible effects of the spell,  making  it
invisible and silent. This has the effect of reducing its damage by 2 per die
(but not below 1 point per die), but making it more conducive to stealth. For
example,  a  fireball modified by silent invisible spell would  explode  with
normal  heat, impact, and such, but would be invisible and silent. Note  that
this  does not conceal either the caster or the spell's victims or any  sound
made  by them, only the visible and audible portions of the spell. It adds  5
to  the  casting  time  of the other spell, but requires  no  extra  material
components.  The  casting  of  the other spell must  be  started  within  the
duration of this spell.

This  spell causes the caster's staff to be surrounded at both striking  ends
with  a  crackling, dark aura. The colour varies, but is generally  dark  and
ominous. The aura enhances the staff's value as a weapon in several ways.  It
gives  a  +1 to-hit (this does not affect what creatures may be hit  by  it).
Also, it induces extreme, mind-numbing pain in any target it hits. This  pain
forces  the  creature to make a system shock roll at -30% or fall unconscious
for 2d6 rounds. Even if they succeed, they can take no action for the rest of
the  round, and are at -3 (or -15%) on all rolls for the next two rounds. The
aura  is  not dispelled by a single attack, it lasts for the entire  duration
and can be used for as many attacks as the caster is able to make.
The reverse of the spell, staff of pleasure, causes the ends of the staff  to
be  surrounded at both ends with a bright, metallic glow. The colour  varies,
but  is  generally  positive and cheery. The staff can still  be  used  as  a
weapon,  but  has  a  chance of inducing sadomasochistic  tendencies  in  the
creatures hit (5% chance for any single being hit). The aura induces  extreme
pleasure   in   a  being  hit  by  the  spell,  effectively  disrupting   all
concentration  and making them unable to do anything else in  the  round.  If
they fail a system shock roll (no modifier), they pass out from the pleasure.
The  aura lasts for the entire duration, and people might just line up to  be
tapped by it.
There  is  a  third  application  of  the  spell,  which  must  be  memorised
separately,  as if it were a reversed version, and which is called  staff  of
pleasure  and pain. It combines the spells, making one end of the staff  glow
with  the  pain  aura  and the other end with the pleasure  aura.  Both  ends
function  as above, and a creative wizard can find hundreds of uses for  this
version.

This  spell conjures several bolts of force to be directed at one large  size
creature  or smaller within range. The victim receives a saving throw  versus
spell  at  -2 to escape its effects. Otherwise, they are knocked against  the
floor  by a blast of force (or against a wall if more convenient) and  nailed
to it by glowing force spikes.
The initial bolt knocks a creature into the best possible surface, but causes
no  actual  damage. The other bolts impale the creature's various  limbs  (or
body,  if  no  limbs are available) to the surface in question,  causing  1d3
points  per limb. This serves to (painfully) immobilize the target  creature,
and typically cannot kill it due to the nature of the damage.
The  spell  lasts  for  24 hours or until one of the  spikes  is  removed.  A
creature may attempt to remove the spikes by itself, but each attempt (a bend
bars  roll  at -25%) causes 2d4 damage to the limb in question regardless  of
success.

The material component is a small, rusty iron spike.

This  spell is cast upon a paragraph of writing, a sign, or a drawing of some
kind.  The  writing or image should be freshly made by the caster himself  or
while he watches, and upon its completion the caster casts the spell.
The spell implants an invisible "subtext" into the work, causing all who read
it  to  subconsciously  be  compelled by its meaning.  The  message  conveyed
subliminally  is  chosen by the caster, and should follow the  guidelines  of
suggestion  (q.v.). Those viewing or reading the work are  then  required  to
roll  a  saving  throw  versus paralysation or be  compelled  to  follow  its
directives.  A  person  succeeding the throw is  unaware  that  anything  has
occurred,  and even those whose behaviour has been altered by the spell  have
no idea where their implanted urges originated.
The  suggestion remains for a maximum of two weeks, or until acted upon.  The
exact  duration  of  the  behaviour changed depends  on  the  nature  of  the
suggestion.  As  with suggestion, no obviously suicidal or alignment  rending
activity can be forced upon a victim.

The  material  component is the paper upon which the  subliminal  message  is
inscribed.

This  spell is based on the concept that summoning spells reach across planes
to  grab  likely creatures: it simply targets a creature with an energy  that
makes  that creature lots more likely to be summoned for a stime. The spell's
energy  only  works for 4 rounds, and each round of the spell,  the  creature
targeted  has a 3% chance (per level of the caster) to be yanked  away  by  a
summoning  spell from somewhere else. Typically, summoning spells  which  are
seeking  on  the  plane  of the caster are originating from  other,  parallel
dimensions.
The  creature remains gone for a number of rounds determined by its level  or
Hit  Dice:  the  method  is  to  consult the monster  summoning  spell  which
corresponds  to its power level. The duration listed for that  spell  is  the
duration  for which they should be gone. There is also a base 5% chance  that
the  creature  will never return to that location. If the  creature  is  more
powerful than the creatures that can be summoned under the 9th-level  monster
summoning VII, the summoning hook fails.
This spell can also be used as a bizarre way to go adventuring. If the wizard
casts  the  summoning hook on himself, he has the listed chance to be  yanked
into  a strange dimension for a period of time equal to one day per level  of
the wizard. The reason that the duration functions differently for the caster
is  that  he is voluntarily being summoned. Also, the caster is not  summoned
strictly  by  the relevant monster summoning spell, but can show  up  at  the
beckoning  of  any summoning-type spell, and his power level  may  be  wildly
greater  or less than that desired by the otherdimensional wizard  doing  the
summoning.  The  table  below  should be consulted  for  the  nature  of  the
summoning which calls the caster if he is picked up by the hook:

     D100 Roll Nature of Summoning
      01-05      Monster summoning I-III: this will astonish the other wizard
and likely prove more than a match for intended opponents.
      06-15      Monster summoning IV-VII: possibly weaker than intended  and
may cause the wizard to be in a bad situation...
     16-25     The wizard shows up in response to a "demon summoning" type of
spell and is suspected to be a disguised demon.
     26-40     The wizard steps through a newly-opened gate.
      41-55     Monster summoning appropriate for the wizard's level,  if  at
all possible.
     56-65     Summoned by a psionicist's psychoportation power.
      66-75      Appears  in  the  lab  of an experimenting  otherdimensional
wizard.
     76-85     Steps from the surge of an otherdimensional wild mage.
     86-99     Falls through a dimensional rift - who knows where?
     00   Intentionally summoned ("But who would summon me?").

The  material  component is a golden grappling hook, no more  than  3  inches
long, affixed to a bit of phase spider web.

This spell is an enhancement of the already formidable capacities of the 8th-
level  Darklight's improved force armour. It is the same as the  lower  level
spell, except as noted.
Superior  force  armour enhances the movement capacities of the  wizard  even
more  than the improved version. The wizard can run at a maximum speed of  MV
24  in a relatively straight line, or in combat, MV 18. The flight capacities
function  underwater or in vacuum, as well as in atmosphere. Its maximum  and
cruising speeds are as below:

     Environment    Maximum Speed  Cruising Speed
     Vacuum    128  48
     Normal flight  96   36
     Fluid environment   48   24
     Viscous (ooze, lava)     36   18

The  forearm  blades are also improved, remaining retractable, but  having  a
base  cutting damage of 2d12 each. Three attacks per round are possible  with
the  speed  of  the armour's movement enhancement. Also, the armour  acts  to
amplify  the strength of the wearer, giving the wearer 16 + 2d4 Strength  for
the  duration,  giving  the blades extra damage potential  (Strength  bonuses
apply here only) as well as giving the armour lifting power to help it out of
tight spots.
The  suit also helps to compensate for the wizard's inability to cast spells,
by adding "attack packages". Several options are possible, each being sets of
spells  with a limited number of charges. These spells can be fired  off  two
per  round at the wizard's discretion, and take the place of the suit's blade
attacks.  They otherwise act as the normal spells in most respects,  and  are
"cast"  at the wizard's level. Note that these are simply triggered "charges"
implanted  in  the structure of the armour, and not subject to  normalcasting
restrictions.
Attack packages that are available:
          10 magic missiles, 10 flame arrows, 5 rays of enfeeblement
          10 stinking clouds, 5 cloudkills, 5 cones of cold, 2 fireballs
          10 lightning bolts, 10 Melf's minute meteors, 5 chromatic orbs
          5 freezing sphere rays, 5 cones of cold, 10 snowballs
           10  webs,  10  sleep darts, 5 wand of paralysis rays,  5  stinking
clouds
          10 flame arrows, 5 fireballs, 20 burning hands
Only  one  of  the above may be chosen at the time of casting, and  once  all
charges  are spent, the armour cannot trigger more spells unless  the  entire
spell is recast (this must be performed after the duration expires).
The  armour is a sapphire blue glow in colour, and is brighter at the joints,
as  well  as  along  the  blades  and at the  structures  controlling  weapon
packages. The force jets emit a bright azure radiance.

The  material component is a diamond cut to resemble a small person, to which
is  affixed with golden wire a ruby sword, sapphire wings, and one  perfectly
cut opal for each five spell charges.

This spell will cause an inanimate object to be transformed into a tattoo  on
the caster's skin. The object must be touched only at the end of the casting,
enabling  lit torches or campfires to be tattooed. Large objects will  shrink
to  no  more than a 1x1 foot square area. The transformed items remain  until
the  caster "peels" it off and throws it to the ground. While in tattoo form,
they  appear as full-colour, intricate representations of the item  contained
within.  A  dispel magic upon the caster will require each to make  a  saving
throw versus polymorph at the level of the caster. Each one which fails  will
spring  back  into original form instantaneously. A caster may have  as  many
tattoos  on  his body as could reasonably fit. If the caster  dies,  all  the
items are immediately released.

This  spell modifies another spell of sixth level or lower so that it can  be
cast  directly across a telepathic link. It extends the range of the  dweomer
so  that it is conducted directly across the telepathic link and takes effect
on  the  creature  on  the  other end of the link. It  functions  via  either
magical, psionic, or natural telepathy.
The  spell  to be cast is also enhanced so that its casting time  is  reduced
substantially,  so  that  the entire incantation can  be  performed  with  an
initiative  modifier  of  no  more than 1. This causes  the  type  of  spells
available for the tracer to be limited. No spell with a casting time  of  one
round  or  more  can be used, but it can be used to transmit an  area  effect
spell,  so that a prying wizard can bring a fireball down on himself and  his
surroundings.
The spell to be transmitted over the tracer must be in memory as wel and both
are  cast  simultaneously, so in effect, the wizard is casting two spells  at
once.  This is not without risk, there being a base 5% chance that the  spell
backfires, unleashing the secondary spell on the caster himself.
Note  that  the  link  can be initiated by either person  involved,  but  the
telepathic tracer spell does not provide a means of telepathic contact. Using
the  spell  via  a  helm  of telepathy is risky, as the  chance  of  backfire
increases to 10% with this method.

This spell causes a powerful and foolproof veil of undetectability to conceal
the  target and its carried belongings. The spell name implies a mere  visual
concealment, but the actual effect of the spell is much more potent.
The   recipient  cannot  be  seen,  either  by  normal  sight,   infravision,
ultravision,  detect magic, detect life, detect invisibility, and  even  true
seeing.  Clairvoyance  and  scrying  fail  upon  the  recipient,  as  do  any
divinations used upon him or upon an item he carries.
The  recipient  also cannot be heard, smelt, tasted, or felt.  He  leaves  no
tracks  and makes no sound. His voice cannot be heard by anyone, making  most
spellcasting (unfortunately) unlikely.
No  known means of penetrating illusions, aside from a wish or limited  wish,
can  reveal the creature. Dispel magic, anti-magic shell, and related effects
cannot touch this enchantment.
In  short,  aside from the close scrutiny of a greater god, a  wish,  or  the
death  of  the  creature, no means can locate the being, whether extraplanar,
magical, psionic, or otherwise. Even physical contact is rationalized away by
those touching the creature (although an attack causes extreme suspicion  and
the  victim of such an attack knows something is up). Thus, a -8 penalty  to-
hit against such a creature is incurred.

The material component is a bottle, inside which is maintained a near perfect
vacuum.

This  spell is a last-ditch survival tactic by which the affected person  may
obtain  balanced  nourishment from anything which can  be  safely  swallowed,
including  dirt,  small rocks, leaves, sticks, coins, etc. It  confers  a  +3
bonus on any saving throw versus ingested poisons during its duration,  as  a
side  effect. In addition, potions imbibed by the affected have  only  a  50%
chance  of  actually  working. The duration is one day;  the  recipients  are
advised  not  to eat any more "junk" after the first 12 hours without  a  re-
casting  of  the spell, as the "food" might not have had time to digest.  The
rather  ugly consequences that undigested rocks or coins in the bowels  might
have  is  left  up to the DM's own imagination. The spell does not  help  the
taste  of  the  things  eaten, however, and is  designed  to  work  with  the
Darklight's illusion of taste spell (q.v.). Scrolls have been found with only
one or the other, however.

This spell is used to protect the caster from stabbing, slashing, or piercing
from  hand to hand weapons. It acts by warping space locally so that any  hit
which  would  pierce  the skin of the wizard is warped to  the  body  of  the
attacker.  Any  damage  which  would have  affected  the  wizard  is  instead
inflicted  upon  his opponent. This is not at all effective  against  missile
weapons  (in  this case, the warp has no close opponent to target)  or  blunt
weapons (they do not penetrate the skin sufficiently if at all).
A  wizard with this spell often exposes himself to deadly strikes and  stands
confident  as his foes kill themselves. A foe who strikes for the kill  at  a
wizard  with  this  protection automatically takes maximum  damage  from  the
weapon, and if they rolled 5 or more than required to hit the wizard, receive
a critical hit upon themselves.

The material component is a miniature lead sword which has been bent in half.

When a wizard casts this spell, he is surrounded by an invisibleaura, like  a
cloak,  that  absorbs and stores magical energy in the form of spell  levels.
Once cast, the cloak lasts until it absorbs its maximum (see below). One such
cloak  can absorb up to half the caster's level (round down) in wizard  spell
levels. The spells absorbed must be cast directly at the caster. Area  effect
spells (like fireball and cloudkill) cannot be absorbed. If a spell cannot be
totally absorbed, the cloak has no effect on it.
When  the  cloak  absorbs its maximum, it remains active for  another  round.
During this time, the wizard can enhance the effects of a single other  spell
using  the previously stored energy: he can cast one spell as if he  was  one
level higher than he actually is, per two full spell levels absorbed. If  the
wizard  chooses  not to use the stored energy, it is released  the  following
round as a harmless warm light around him.
Example:  an 8th-level wizard casts absorbing cloak; he can absorb  up  to  4
spell  levels.  Some time later, he is hit with a magic missile  (+1)  and  a
lightning  bolt (+3), all absorbed. At the same round, another magic  missile
hits, but as the cloak is full, damage is normal. In the following round, the
wizard  decides  to use the stored energy to enhance his own lightning  bolt.
The  bolt  will  inflict  10d6  points of damage  instead  of  8d6  HP,  with
appropriate adjustments to range and area of effect.
The  use  of  true  seeing or similar magic will reveal the presence  of  the
protective aura, in the form of a shadow cloak worn by the caster.

The  material component of the spell is a silver or gold piece,  consumed  in
the casting. The spell is not cumulative with itself.

This  spell  is a rather offensive version of dispel magic and  is  primarily
used  to  actively counter hostile magic. Upon casting it on a blade  of  any
type,  the weapon is surrounded with a red aura and thereafter acts as  a  +1
weapon (with normal penalties if the caster is not proficient in it).
Every successful strike of the blade dispels magic, as per the spell, at  the
caster's level and using the attack roll as the dispel roll. This can be used
against  anything normally subject to dispel magic: magical barriers,  items,
or effects of any kind.
The  caster  can end the spell at will. The use of the blade does not  hinder
movement  and does not preclude spellcasting any more than an ordinary  blade
does. The caster is immune to the dispelling effects of the blade.

The  material  component  of the spell is any bladed  weapon,  which  is  not
consumed when the spell expires.

The  wizard  can  cast this spell on himself only, to avenge himself  against
future  death.  Anyone  who kills the caster, even if  the  wizard  is  later
resurrected,  becomes the victim of a special curse. The curse manifests  1d4
turns  after the killing. There is 95% chance for the victim to be  affected.
Exceptionally  intelligent beings (avangions and the like) receive  a  normal
saving  throw  versus  death magic to avoid the effects.  The  magic  can  be
dispelled  before  the  wizard's death only by  a  higher  level  caster.  To
determine the effects of the curse, roll on the following table:

     D100 Roll Result
     01-20     Reduce three random, different ability scores to 2d4+1 each.
      21-40      Maximum  hit points is 20% of the original; cannot  increase
until curse lifted.
      41-60      -5  penalty to attack, damage (minimum damage is 0),  Armour
Class and saving throws.
      61-80     Magical attacks against the victim cause maximum damage;  the
victim  receives  a  saving throw versus spell of 18, with  no  modifications
whatsoever.
      81-00      This applies only if the killer is a person, roll  again  if
not.  Every  other NPC who meets the killer senses something very  bad  about
him.  Nobody trusts him, since he carries a "smell of death". Such  a  person
will  always  receive  at  least  a "cautious"  reaction  from  NPCs  and  is
considered  to  be at most "indifferent", never friendly himself,  no  matter
what  he  does. Reactions are left to the DM. They may include hostile  mobs,
ceaseless hunting by templars, animals attacking on the spot etc.

There  are  five known ways to remove the curse. Other than these, the  curse
might  be  removed if a sufficiently powerful wizard could research a  custom
spell  for this purpose. This would certainly require some body part  of  the
original caster.
The spell may be removed:
           With  a limited wish or wish, cast for this purpose. Nothing fancy
is  required, a simple job provided you have the wish. It is also possible to
remove  the  curse using a 7th-level priest spell analogous to remove  curse,
such as remove bane, but this is very hard to find. Remove bane is considered
an equivalent of a wish in this case.
           With  a remove curse, cast by a wizard or priest of a higher level
than the caster. The victim must save versus death magic, with no bonuses for
magical  items or the like counting; success removes the curse while  failure
means that no attempt to remove the curse with remove curse can be done  ever
again.
           With  a  dispel magic, cast by a wizard or priest of higher  level
than the caster who has never met him personally. Even then, only one attempt
per  level  is  allowed. Each failure increases the dispelling difficulty  by
one.
           The  killer  may  decide to atone for his deed. As  soon  as  this
thought  is  sincerely  formed in his mind, the curse  is  lifted  for  three
months.  During  this period the killer must have the caster resurrected,  by
any  means.  If he succeeds, the curse is permanently lifted. If during  this
time  he  acts in any way towards other ends, for example trying to lift  the
curse with another way, it returns immediately and further atonement attempts
fail.  At the DM's discretion, the three-month period may be extended or  the
curse lifted temporarily or even permanently, depending on the situation.
          With the intervention of a sorcerer-king or a divine being.

Upon casting this spell, the invoker must join his two hands in front of him,
as  if he was holding a two-handed sword. He then channels magical energy  to
form  a  four feet pole of blue-white light, which springs out of his grasped
hands. He can use it silently and he is immune to its effects.
The  pole can perform as a magical sword. The caster suffers penalties if not
proficient in any sword. Damage is 1d6/1d8. The blade hits with a +3 bonus to
attack  and  +n  to  damage, where n equals the number of  experience  levels
beyond  fifth.  A  10th-level wizard, for example, hits large  creatures  for
1d8+5 HP plus any Strength bonuses he might have.
The  blade  cannot  cut through solid metal or stone. It  has  the  following
abilities, at the caster's mental command:
           Fear, once. All within 10 yards must save versus spell or flee for
1d4  rounds.  The  caster usually employs this as his first action  with  the
blade.
           Lightning  bolt,  once. A lightning bolt effect  is  created  but,
unlike  the spell, the victim must make a Dexterity check to avoid it. Large,
huge  and  gigantic creatures have a penalty of -2, -3, -5. Immobile  targets
make  no check. The bolt inflicts 6d6 HP. The target can be at most 30yd away
and in direct visual contact with the caster. The bolt cannot harm any other.
           Swing, once. The caster can swing the blade and thus have a chance
to  hit  every opponent in melee with him. A separate attack roll is required
for  each one. If fighting a single large creature, the caster can use  swing
to gain a second attack on it at that round.
           Drain life, once. The caster must announce this before the attack.
If  he  makes a successful roll and in addition to the damage inflicted,  the
victim is drained for a further 3d4 HP, gained by the caster.
           Vorpal action, twice. The caster must announce this before  making
the  attack  roll. If he rolls a 17 or more, the blade acts as vorpal  blade,
slaying  a  humanoid,  human sized, opponent. The two  attacks  need  not  be
consecutive.  On  a larger creature this attack gives +2 to  the  attack  and
damage.
Undead take half damage from the blade and are not affected by drain life and
fear  effects.  All special powers can be used simultaneously with  a  normal
attack, except for lightning bolt.
The  caster can combine the drain or vorpal attacks with the swing action.  A
vorpal  action can only be used once during the whole spell if combined  with
swing. If the caster is hastened, he can double the number of his attacks but
each special power lasts for a single attack.
The  main  disadvantage of this spell is that the wizard cannot  cast  spells
that  require  somatic or material components, as the two  hands  are  firmly
grasped  to each other. Another problem is that each time the caster  uses  a
special  power of the blade, he temporarily loses 1 HP, needed  to  feed  the
blade  (a combined action needs 2 HP). This damage occurs at the end  of  the
round and can be healed normally.
Because the caster cannot loose his hands and deform the blade, he gains  the
following benefit: if he is caught in a bear hug or similar attack  from  any
creature,  he  gains a free attack with the blade at the  time  of  the  hug.
Furthermore,  if the attacker is in front of him, the caster can  attack  and
succeed  automatically, inflicting double damage every round. The wizard  can
still use any remainispecial powers of the blade, except swing.
The  spell  ends  if the wizard loses control of his hands (including  charm,
possession etc.), a successful dispel magic is cast upon him, if he  casts  a
limited wish or similar magic or if he enters a dead magic area (for example,
an  anti-magic shell, a dispelling screen, etc.). Note that the caster cannot
end  the spell at will. He is free to cast it as if he were in a lower  level
than he actually is, though, with the appropriate THAC0, damage, etc.

The material component is a hair of the caster.

This  spell  is  used  to protect some "hot" and vulnerable  items,  such  as
spellbooks,  scrolls and material components. The wizard leaves  these  in  a
specially  prepared place and then uses a small "linking  device"  to  recall
them to his current place.
The store must be created first. This is a chest of up to 4x3x3 foot size. It
can  have compartments or secret mechanisms and traps. The exterior  must  be
crafted  from pure obsidian and carved with scenes of the wizard's  life.  It
costs  a  minimum of 5000 gp for the basic work. Regardless of the  contents,
the chest always weighs 15 pounds.
As  long as they fit inside, spellbooks, maps, scrolls, potions, coins, etc.,
can  be  stored in the chest, with the exception of weapons: only one  weapon
can  be  stored. In addition, everything in the chest must have been  in  the
property  of  the  wizard for at least 24 consecutive hours  before  storage,
otherwise the chest will not function at all.
Then the wizard must construct two identical "linking" devices. These can  be
almost  anything but they must be made of metal. Usually they  are  something
small  and  discreet,  such  as earrings or rings or  bracelets.  Their  cost
usually is around 3 gp each. The wizard then casts the spell on them and  the
chest. One of them fuses inside the chest, thus providing the necessary  link
with the other device.
From  then on and for the spell's duration, the wizard leaves the chest in  a
presumably  well  guarded  place and carries the  second  device,  always  in
contact with his flesh (failure to do so ends the spell).
Three times per day, the wizard can summon the chest. He can then examine  or
alter  the contents, use his spellbooks to memorise spells, etc. He can  send
the  chest  back to its hiding place or keep it, as he likes.  Summoning  and
sending away the chest count as an action and require one round each.
The  chest and the caster must be in the same plane of existence in order for
the spell to work. The material components of the spell are the chest and the
linking devices; the latter are consumed at the end of the spell.
A wizard can only have one such chest in operation at any given time.

This  spell  is cast on two creatures that have just reached an agreement  of
any sort. The wizard may be one of them. Both subjects must be willing to  be
affected by the spell or else it fails in an obvious way.
The  casting requires the donation of a personal item, worth about 1 gp, from
each  of the subjects. The items do not vanish and the subjects may get  them
back  after  the spell ends. The spell also requires a gem of any  sort,  the
core  gem, of at least 500 gp value. This lasts until the spell ends and then
turns to ash.
The  items and the core gem must be placed in a small obsidian case. This  is
sealed during the casting with 3 HP of blood from each of the subjects; these
can only be healed naturally. The case can have other protections.
For  the  duration of the spell the wizard will be instantly aware if  either
member  of  the pact breaks it, that is, if one or both subjects  have  acted
against  the agreement they have made. The caster also learns if this  action
was made willingly or not (i.e.: if under a charm or the like).
The  spell  deals  with the spirit and not the letter of the  agreement.  For
example, the wizard will be informed if one of the subjects coats his  weapon
with  poison  in  order to strike his partner, even though no  actual  attack
takes place.
The  spell  does not in any way hinder the actions of the subjects.  Further,
the  wizard  only learns if the pact is broken, and nothing more.  The  spell
does not in any way give him the ability to communicate with the subjects  or
inform them, for example.
The  spell normally lasts for two weeks per level of the caster. During  that
time, the wizard will be informed every time a subject acts against the pact.
If both subjects decide willingly to break their pact, the spell ends and the
wizard  is informed about it. It is possible to cast more of such spells  for
the same pact but each requires a new core gem and a new blood sacrifice.
Dispel magic must be successfully cast on the core gem to end the spell.

This  complex  spell can inflict massive damage to opponents if  successfully
cast. During the casting time, the wizard gathers energy from the surrounding
land,  which  is  then released as deadly lightning bolts  to  all  creatures
within the area of effect (concealment or something like that can help  avoid
the  bolts).  Note  that this spell does not distinguish between  allies  and
enemies.
The  gathering of energy is difficult. The wizard must concentrate  for  some
time  and  each additional round augments the power of the bolts. The  energy
returns  to the land through the victims' bodies, while causing great damage.
The casting time of the spell equals the concentration time.
The  caster  is  not able to perfectly control the collection of  energy,  so
there  is  a possibility of spell failure before completion. If this happens,
all  energy returns to the land and the spell is wasted. A check must be made
for each casting round.
Only  high  level spellcasters can gather large amounts of energy. This  fact
and all the details above are summarized in the following table:

     Conc. Time     HP of     Spell     Radius    Min.
     in rounds Damage    failure   in feet   level
     1    4    1%   20   12
     2    9    1%   30   12
     3    15   2%   50   12

     9    72   20%  250  16
     10   85   30%  300  17

During  the  whole casting time, the caster remains aware of his  environment
and  is able to perform basic mental actions. This includes choosing a target
for Melf's minute meteors or ceasing one of his previously cast spells.

The  material  components are a wooden staff and a small obsidian  orb  which
costaround 50 gp. The wizard must hold the staff on the ground with one  hand
and hold the orb high with the other. The staff gathers energy and stores  it
in  the orb. When the wizard desires to strike, he must first lift the  staff
and  then  crush the orb on the ground (the orb becomes fragile and  shatters
automatically if dropped). The staff is not consumed.
If the caster is physically hit or the orb is damaged during the casting, the
spell is not totally wasted. The orb releases some of the stored energy; some
is  lost.  To  find out how much energy is actually released roll  1d4+1  and
subtract  the  result from the current casting round. As a side  effect,  the
caster  suffers  half  the stated damage as well, with  a  saving  throw  for
quarter damage.
For example, if the wizard is disrupted in the 6th round, the orb breaks. The
1d4 rolled gives 1. Thus, the orb releases enough energy to inflict 22 HP  to
all creatures within 70 feet. The caster takes 11 points of damage or 5 HP if
he saves.

To cast this spell, the wizard needs to have some defiler ash. As long as the
spell  remains  in effect, the caster will be automatically  warned  whenever
that  particular defiler is within a radius of one mile. Furthermore, if  the
defiler  is closer than 300 yards, the caster can receive a mental  image  of
his  location, if the defiler fails a saving throw versus spell. Even if  the
saving  throw succeeds, the caster will know the exact direction and distance
if the defiler remains within 300 yards.
This  spell can be blocked by lead or other divination-protective means.  The
material  component is some defiler ash, which vanishes at  the  end  of  the
casting.  One can cast this spell many times to track a specific defiler,  as
long as one has some ash available.

Upon casting this spell, the staff of the wizard is covered with a number  of
bright  energy tendrils. These can then arc to any creatures in the  area  of
effect, draining their life energy throughout the caster and emitting  it  as
visible light from the staff.
Any  creature  within range is subject to attack from the tendrils  and  must
save versus spell to avoid being hit. Once a tendril hits, it remains wrapped
until the spell expires or the target dies. The spell creates one tendril per
level above 8th.
If  the  target saves, he can act freely that round but is subject to  attack
the  next  round if within range. In any case, he can be wrapped by a  single
tendril  only. The caster chooses the creatures to attack but can  only  make
one attack per target per round.
The  drain  begins the round following a successful wrap.  For  each  of  the
caster's  levels of experience, one hit point is drained from every  creature
wrapped and emitted as light from the staff. The more hit points drained  the
more intense is the light. A victim can act with no penalties except that  it
is unable to leave the area of effect.
The caster can let the spell last for as long as he wishes, but he must touch
the  staff  and concentrate during all this time, and cannot even  talk.  The
process  is  very tiresome and at the end of the spell the caster  loses  two
points of Constitution and one point of Strength. One day of complete, shaded
rest  restores one point of each ability. If the wizard casts the spell  more
than  once per day, he suffers a cumulative -3 Constitution, -2 Strength each
time.

The material component of the spell is the staff. This must have a number  of
steel nails on it, at least one nail per tendril to be released. Such a  nail
costs  about one gold piece. On the head of each nail a miniature skull  must
be engraved. The staff is not consumed in the casting.

This powerful spell offers protection against attacks of elemental nature. It
can  selectively block attacks based on air, earth, fire and water. The  type
of  the  element must be stated at memorisation time. It is a weaker  version
(although not exactly similar) of elemental aura.
Once the spell is cast, the wizard and his possessions are totally immune  to
all  attacks  of  that  element. However, attacks  from  the  other  elements
automatically  succeed and attacks from the opposite element  inflict  double
damage as well, if not otherwise blocked: the caster lowers his resistance to
them in order to better protect himself against the fourth one.
Example:  if  the caster is immune to fire, a water or earth elemental  could
hit him with no attack roll needed; the water would cause double damage.
          Air attacks include: air, electricity, wind, gases, clouds.
          Earth attacks include: wood or stone weapons, any piece of rock not
larger than the caster and attacks from stone golems.
          Fire attacks include: fires, heat, lava and the like.
          Water attacks include: rain, ice and cold, acids.
The  spell  protects  against both natural and magical attacks,  for  example
lightning bolt, fireball, Melf's acid arrow, watery double...
The  caster  also  gains immunity to physical attacks from creatures  of  the
relevant  plane  (including conjured elementals).  Breath  attacks  using  an
element (sand breath, gas breath) are not immune against but have a +3  bonus
to the saving throw instead.
The  caster  cannot use this spell to travel within a given element  (natural
air  excluded). He cannot, for example, breathe underwater or dive in  a  pit
full  of  silt.  In addition, this spell does not function in  the  elemental
planes.
At  any  given time, the caster can be immune against a single element  only.
Subsequent casting of this spell with a different element stated cancels  the
previous one. This of course has nothing to do with magical items that  offer
element protection, which always operate normally.

The material components are as follows, among with their minimum cost:
          Air: opal powder that the caster must sprinkle over him (30 gp).
          Earth: a small diamond that the caster must swallow (20 gp).
           Fire: a piece of fine wood, carved with a ruby of at least  60  gp
value.
          Water: a gallon of water blessed by a priest.

With  this spell the caster can turn ordinary daggers or knives or dirks into
energy  bolts. Each of them can then be thrown, to inflict 1d6 HP,  plus  one
hit  point  per two levels. If not proficient in the dagger, he  suffers  the
appropriate penalty. Strength bonuses do not apply to the damage roll but  do
apply  in  the  attack roll. The substance of the weapon is consumed  by  the
spell  the round after the throw, regardless of success. The caster can  turn
into  bolts  a number of daggers equal to his level, up to ten.  The  casting
time  of  the spell is three plus 1 for each dagger. The weapons can be  made
from  wood,  bone,  obsidian or steel and after the  casting  are  considered
magical (no plusses) to determine what they can hit.
The  caster touches all the weapons, one after the other. Thereafter, if they
are  thrown  at a target, they are transformed into white energy  balls.  The
weapons can be thrown by the caster or any who can put a hand on them, for  a
period  of  time equal to the caster's level in rounds. After this time,  the
weapons melt with a sudden emission of heat.
The  casting of permanency or similar magics on the weapons, just after  this
spell, stabilizes the magic until they are thrown. Permanency can affect  the
whole result of an enhanced daggers spell.

The  material components of the spell are the weapons themselves,  which  are
consumed at the end of the spell's duration or when thrown.

With  this  spell, the caster can simply move from the prime  to  the  border
ethereal  or in the reverse direction. Up to one creature per two levels  can
travel with the caster, by joining hands.
Each  casting of the spell provides a one-way trip. To travel in the opposite
direction,  another casting of the same spell or the use of  other  means  is
required.
From the border ethereal the caster can move to the deep ethereal or to other
planes.  See  also the Manual of the Planes. As a reminder, for  every  round
that passes in the ethereal, ten rounds pass in the prime material plane.

Darkray  formed this spell from Melf's minute meteors and magic missile.  Its
main purpose is not to inflict damage but to counter a hostile spellcaster.
The  spell  enables the wizard to cast small fiery globes, one per  level  of
experience he has attained. The wizard can throw one globe per round  at  the
same  or  different living targets. Each of them inflicts 1 point of  damage.
They  are  formed from pure magical energy and seem to materialize  over  the
head of the caster before speeding towards their target.
The  missiles have two special characteristics: they never miss (as do  magic
missiles) and they always strike at the very beginning of a round.
The conditions required to hit a target with this spell are the same as those
of magic missile. If a target goes invisible after he has already been struck
by at least one ball, he is allowed a saving throw versus spell to avoid each
missile  aimed at him while he remains invisible. The conditions in case  (B)
of Melf's minute meteors also apply to this spell.
Since  the  globes created by this spell are similar to magic missiles,  they
can be countered with appropriate ways.

Upon  casting this spell, a special aura surrounds the caster. The  aura  can
change  colours  and patterns, completely matching those of the  environment.
The  match is automatic for as long as the caster wishes. When surrounded  by
this  aura he is 95% undetectable in all but the brightest of areas. He makes
no noise and has no smell.
If  the caster attacks or casts an offensive spell, he becomes visible for an
instant; creatures that watch carefully can see him but in the next round  he
becomes  hidden  once again. He can make almost any other action  and  remain
hidden  inside the protective aura. Powder, sand and other similar  materials
thrown  onto the caster while his aura is active makes his shape visible  for
that  round.  In the next round he becomes hidden once again. Note  that  the
aura is considered "on" during all this time.
The  caster  can  switch the aura on and off any number of times  within  the
spell's  duration,  each  change requiring but a moment.  With  each  change,
small, harmless arcs of lightning engulf his body.
The  duration  of the aura remaining active is five rounds per level  of  the
caster.  This is not the duration of the spell. The wizard can turn  off  the
aura, go to sleep and use the remaining time next morning. Seven days is  the
absolute maximum, however. Beyond this, any remaining time is lost.
The  caster  is subject to magical or psionic detection. Detect  invisibility
and  true seeing, as well as the psionic devotion life detection, can  locate
the actual position of the caster.

The material component of this spell is a 100 gp gem.

When  the  wizard casts this spell, he becomes completely immune to  physical
attacks  by creatures of up to and including 6 levels or Hit Dice. For  every
two  levels  beyond twelfth the caster attains, the level or Hit  Dice  limit
augments by one: 7 HD at fourteenth level, 8 HD at sixteenth level, 9  HD  at
eighteenth  level, etc. The immunity includes attacks from persons,  such  as
punching.

The material component is the claw of a creature having suitable Hit Dice;  6
at  twelfth  level,  7 at fourteenth, etc. A lesser one  can  be  used,  with
analogous decrease to the spell's power.

      Upon  casting  this rather humorous spell, a pair of disembodied  hands
appear  and  are directed at the target. The hands start tickling the  victim
around  their waist. The victim must be humanoid (undead excluded). No saving
throw is allowed, but he can make a Wisdom check to avoid the effect, with  a
-1  penalty for every 2 levels of the caster. Failing that, the tickling  has
the following effects:

      On  the first round the victim suffers a -1 penalty on his attack rolls
and  saving throws and any magical concentration is broken. On the second and
third  he  has  a  penalty of -3. On the following rounds,  until  the  spell
expires,  he can do nothing but trying to avoid the small hands that  disturb
him,  laughing  and  crying at the same time. Every three rounds  the  victim
rolls another Wisdom check to get rid of the spell.

      If  a  person  is  affected  for a number of  rounds  that  exceed  his
Constitution  score, he must roll a Constitution check  each  round  or  fall
unconscious for 2d4 rounds. The caster can end the spell at will.

This  simple  spell  can lock any closeable item in such a  fashion  that  it
cannot be opened except by breaking it. The magic strengthens it, so that  an
effective Strength of 23 is required to break it, using a steel item.
The magic can only be dispelled by a wizard or templar of a level higher than
the  caster.  Clerics and druids cannot dispel the magic. The  spell  is  not
cumulative with a wizard lock.

This  spell belongs to the field of metamagic. Using it, a wizard can augment
the  effects of spells cast the rounds following the casting of this one. The
duration  of the spell is one round per two full caster levels, up to  seven.
Magic that can be affected includes all spells of fifth level or less with  a
casting  time that is less than or equal to seven rounds. The effects  of  an
augmented spell persist even beyond the duration of the enhancer.

The material component is a small gem stone of any value. The stone starts to
glow  when  the  spell is cast and from then on, it acts as a transformer  of
energy:  the  caster  can  spend some of his own hit  points  each  round  to
increase the casting level of his spells, 1 HP per spell level.
For  example,  a  5th-level wizard wants to cast fly as if he  were  eleventh
level. He casts magical enhancer; in the following round, he must spend 6  HP
to  be  able to cast fly at eleventh level (11-5=6). The duration of the  fly
will  be at least 12 turns (duration of fly: 1d6 turns + one turn per level),
even though this is much longer than the duration of the enhancer.
The  maximum casting level that can be achieved with this spell  is  20.  The
enhancer  will not affect other metamagic spells. If the augmentation  brings
the  caster's hit points to zero or less, the character dies but the  desired
spell is completed.

With  this spell a wizard can lower the Armour Class of a creature to 3.  The
effects  are  not  cumulative with other protection (one cannot  improve  his
Armour  Class to better than 3 through the use of this spell), but  Dexterity
bonuses still apply.
For  each  level  of  the  the mail absorbs 2 points  of  damage  that  would
normally  hit AC 3 but with no protection against magical weapons or attacks.
When  it  has  absorbed the maximum damage, it vanishes. It does  not  hinder
movement,  it  is  weightless and does not interfere with  spellcasting.  The
material  component is a piece of rock. Note: this spell is a better  version
of invisible mail (3rd).

This  is  a  weak version of the wish spell. It is used to alter  reality  in
minor  ways. The general rules for wishes apply to this spell as well. As  it
is  significantly weaker than actual wishes, the exact terminology during the
casting is not very important. The DM, of course, can interpret it as he sees
fit.
A  list  of  what the spell can do follows. In braces are some  of  the  side
effects that may occur:
           Restore  to life any creature that died in the previous hour.  The
subject is restored at exactly 1 HP, with a system shock roll required.  This
revival  lasts for one turn plus 1d4rd. At the end of this period the subject
"dies" again. The revival does not count as an actual one, since there is  no
way  to  keep  the  creature alive after the duration expires  (without  more
powerful magic, that is). So, no system shock or Constitution change  follow.
If  another  dead  creature  exists around, it is animated  and  attacks  the
caster.
           Create items for the caster but these are not permanent; they last
for  a  variable amount of time, depending on the substance. Items  could  be
easily  identified  as fakes, if they were especially  precious  or  of  good
quality.
           Heal  1d8+4 points of damage on the caster or others (caster loses
1d2 HP).
           Inflict  1d4+8 points of damage to a creature (save for half)  (as
above).
          Raise an ability for 1d4+1 rounds (another is diminished).
           Destroy  a  creature of 4 HD or less, if it fails a  saving  throw
versus  death  magic;  the creature must be within eyeshot  from  the  caster
(caster loses 1d4 HP).
           Duplicate the effects of any spell of fifth level or less that the
wizard  can normally cast. For example, an invoker cannot use this  spell  to
cast  a spell belonging to the Conjuration/Summoning school. The wizard  must
know  of  the  spell, however, even if he does not have it in his  spellbooks
(the decision is left to the DM as to whether the caster knows of a spell  or
not;  1st-  and 2nd-level spells are considered common knowledge). The  spell
does  not function as would normally be expected; range, duration, etc.,  may
be different.
The  casting  of  a  minor wish does not normally age the  character  as  the
stronger wishes do. However, if it is cast more than once per day, there is a
base  chance of 60% plus 10% for each additional minor wish that one  of  the
following happens:

     D6 Roll   Result
      1     Caster  suffers 3d4 points of damage which can only be healed  by
resting
     2    Caster cannot use magic of any sort for a whole day
      3     Caster's  Strength reduced to 6, one week of  complete  bed  rest
required
     4    Caster ages one year
       5     Caster's  Strength,  Dexterity,  and  Constitution  drop  to  6,
recovering one point per hour resting
     6    Caster loses one Constitution point permanently

The  wizard still states a full wish, when casting this spell. In  line  with
the  limited  wish, only the result indicates that the spell was  actually  a
minor wish, instead of a normal one.

Using this spell, the wizard can construct a "spell pattern" and place it  on
a specifically prepared orb. He can then activate the orb and release all the
spells at once.
The orb (1-2 inches diameter) must be made of any metal and costs at least 30
gp.  The  caster must first memorise the spell parts of the desired  pattern,
plus  this  spell.  He cannot have any other memorised and no  other  magical
items  or  spell  effects should exist in a range of 10 feet  from  him.  The
caster  begins  the spell holding the orb in his hand and then  keeps  it  in
touch  with  him  for 2d4 days. If he loses contact with the orb,  the  spell
fails  and the orb becomes useless, as well as if he uses other magic  or  is
otherwise  interrupted. At the end of this period, the orb becomes noticeably
warm.  The wizard can then place the desired spells on it, casting it one  by
one, at the order he desires. When he is done, he finishes the spell and  the
orb reverts to its normal state.
A  command word is used to activate the orb. When someone holds the  orb  and
speaks  the word, the spell pattern explodes: all the spells cast on the  orb
are  released, one by one, at the order in which they were cast,  with  their
normal casting time. Activating the orb has an initiative modifier of +3.
If  the  orb is activated by a non-wizard, the result is a random casting  of
the  spells  contained. A wizard of sufficient level to  cast  the  contained
spells can control the orb as if it were a normal magical item. A lower level
wizard can only control spells he can cast, the others are cast randomly.
The  caster  can  place  on the orb one spell for each four  full  experience
levels  he has attained. Furthermore, the maximum spell level of each  single
spell  is as follows: fourth at levels 12-14, fifth at 15-17 and sixth at  18
or higher. Finally, all smust belong to the same school of magic.
Here is an example: Darkray is a 13th-level invoker. He can place a total  of
three spells, each of them no higher than fourth level.
He  decides  to place 3 magic missiles. After 5 days of preparation,  he  has
made  his orb (supposing he rolled 5). When he wants to use it, he points  at
the  target and speaks the command word. He rolls an initiative of 4. The orb
is  then activated at 7, the first magic missile going off at 8 and the third
at 10.
If  he had already placed a fireball, dig and ice storm, this happens when he
uses it (after rolling a 1 for initiative):
at moment 4, the orb is activated; at moment 8: fireball, instantaneously; at
moment  11:  dig, for 1 round per level, and at moment 15: ice storm,  for  1
round  per  level.  The result of this is that after the fireball,  the  poor
victims will find themselves struggling not to fall in the pit created by dig
as the ice storm makes the ground extremely slippery.
The orb turns to fine powder at the end of the spell and disperses, never  to
be used again.
If  the  orb is destroyed before the spells are released, it explodes into  a
retributive  strike. All within 10 feet take 1d10 HP per spell level  stored,
no  saving throw. Those within 20 feet take half this damage and those within
40  feet take half damage or a quarter if they save versus breath weapon. The
orb saves as a +3 magical item.
A wizard can only have a pair of such orbs at any given time.

Since poisons on Athas can be extremely lethal, Darkray created this spell to
protect  himself and his companions from such attacks. The spell can  protect
against  any  one  method of poisoning: injected, ingested or  contact.  Upon
casting,   an   invisible   aura  surrounds  the  recipient   (using   detect
invisibility,  eg.,  reveals  the aura). If protecting  against  injected  or
contact  poisons,  the aura covers the whole body. If it is against  ingested
poisons,  it just covers the mouth. The aura protects the subject  against  a
number of poison attacks equal to the half the caster's level (five times  at
ninth level, etc.). The protection lasts until dispelled.
If  an  attack  using poison is made using the suitable method,  the  subject
suffers  no damage from the poison; he suffers normal damage if a weapon  was
used  to  deliver  the poison, however. An individual can only  be  protected
against one method by means of this spell at any given time.

The  material component of the spell is a drop of a poison that  the  subject
must  consume during the casting; the poison must be of the appropriate type,
that is injected, ingested or contact. Protection against natural poisons  is
granted only if these belong specifically to the poison table.
The  spells stoneskin and Darkray's mail of power (q.v.) take precedence over
the poison protector; attacks negated by these spells do not affect it.

With this spell, the wizard can preserve an amount of non-living material for
the  duration of the spell. It must lie within a normal, non-magical box that
fits  entirely  within the area of effect. The box has no special  resistance
but magical or normal wards or traps can be freely placed on it.
After the casting, the contents will enter a state of suspended animation and
time will not affect them: fruits never rot, food remains fresh, etc. The box
becomes sealed and outside conditions do not affect the interior.
Even  the  caster cannot open the box without ending the spell. The box  will
hold  its  contents intact for one week per level of the caster. The contents
can  then  be placed into another box and the spell cast again or the  wizard
can cast the spell again before the duration ends, practically preserving the
contents for an undefined period of time.

The  material component is a normal box, which is not consumed,  and  a  gold
coin that melts and seals the box, vanishing after the duration expires.

This  simple  spell protects the caster from the next feeblemind  attack.  No
matter  what  happens,  the caster is rendered immune  to  exactly  one  such
attack, regardless of source. The spell lasts at most three months. It can be
dispelled only by someone of higher level than the caster.

The material component is a small animal's brain that the caster must consume
during the casting.

This is a metamagic spell. When a wizard casts this spell, he strengthens the
power of spells he subsequently casts. The spell lasts for one round per  two
experience levels of the caster.
While  the spell is in effect, the saving throws of opponents struck  by  the
caster's  spells suffer penalties: -2 at seventh level, -3 at  tenth,  -4  at
thirteenth  etc. The penalties are cumulative with every other  saving  throw
modifier.

Using  this  spell, the caster is able to hold motionless  a  human-sized  or
smaller creature. It affects humanoids and thri-kreen but not half-giants.
The  caster must use a piece of rope as the material component. He casts  the
spell  on  the rope and then he throws it to the target. The rope  is  turned
into  a yellow energy cord during the flight, then without error wraps around
the  target. The victim must save versus spell with a -2 penalty (but  adjust
for Dexterity), or be tied and held by the rope.
When held, the victim cannot move any part of his body. The rope inflicts 1d4
points of damage each round, due to strangulation. If the victim wants to use
psionics  or magic (with verbal components only), a separate initiative  must
be rolled to determine when the damage occurs.
The caster can end the spell at will.

With this spell, the caster can alter his Strength to any value between 6 and
25  inclusive, but greater than his current Strength. In order to do  so,  he
must sacrifice (at the beginning of the casting) a number of hit points equal
to difference between his current Strength and the Strength he wants.
While  under the influence of the spell, the caster gains almost all benefits
from the altered Strength. He does not gain any extra attacks, though.

To  use this spell, the wizard must prepare a special item that will be  used
as  the "target". From then on he can use a "guide" item to home on it, as if
using a teleport spell.
The  target is usable only once. It must be made of metal and be carved  with
scenes  of  the area it is in. It costs no less than 100 gp. The guide  costs
less, around 5 gp and can be made of any material and formed in any shape  or
size.  It  must remain in touch with the wizard, however. Neither the  guide,
nor the target are reusable.
During the casting of the spell, the wizard must burn a mixture of rare herbs
and  items belonging to the area around the target, to charge the guide.  One
charge  equals 50 gp of herbs, with a maximum number of charges equal to  the
caster's  level. After the casting of the spell, the target item must  remain
in the same general place. If it is ever taken farther than 20 yards from the
original  spot, the spell ends. The caster can always tell whether  this  has
happened if he is on the same plane with the target.
As  long as the wizard possesses the guide, he can spend a charge to teleport
back to the target if on the same plane. This follows the standard rules  for
magical item activation, the guide having a +3 initiative modifier. When  its
charges are expended, the guide burns out.

When  the caster utters this spell, his whole body and gear explode in a mass
of  bluish sparks. These disperse in all directions, touching items  or  even
living  creatures,  without causing any harm. They jump  from  one  thing  to
another  in  a mad dance for 1d4 rounds, seemingly fleeing in all directions.
During  this  time it is possible to dispel the magic; success indicates  the
wizard  reappears again near the position of a random spark. The sparks  then
flee.  They  occasionally pop up here and there but dispelling some  of  them
does  not affect the spell. The consciousness of the wizard lives inside them
and he can even pick up images from where they travel.
After  3d6  hours, the sparks will all gather together in a  random  position
within  a  mile from the place of the casting. This second place will  be  as
safe as possible, that is it will not be in the middle of a lake or a hostile
camp.  If no such place exists, for example when in the middle of the Sea  of
Silt,  the sparks will reunite in the original spot, safe or not. The reunion
of  the sparks will cause the wizard to reform, in the same condition as that
he  was  in  during the casting. The DM may give the player some  images  his
character  popped up during the spell, always from within a  one-mile  radius
from the original casting place. After the initial 1d4 rounds, the sparks can
only  be  reunited when the spell expires or with a limited wish  or  similar
magic.

This  spell  was  granted to Daryana, 3rd-level priestess of the  goddess  of
magic, after she had repeatedly, loudly, requested it.
Upon  uttering the verbal component   already mentioned in the  spell's  name
two  things  can happen. If cast consciously, the spell can be  targeted  and
takes  effect  immediately. In this case, some faeces appear anywhere  within
the range of the spell.
If  this  spell was memorised, but the verbal component uttered more or  less
unconsciously, the spell's effect is delayed for up to 1 hour while the place
of  impact is anywhere within 10 feet around the unfortunate priest, both  at
the DM's discretion.

      The  spellcaster  may  affect one individual  of  the  opposite  sexual
orientation to become enamoured with the spellcaster and willingly subject to
all  of  his or her commands. That the victim has been seduced (magically  or
otherwise)  will  be readily apparent to those who make a  successful  Wisdom
check.  In  order to cast the spell, the spellcaster must extract a  personal
item of the victim's, and then cast the spell onto the item in solitude. When
the  item  is given back to the victim and recognized, the spell is complete.
The material component is not consumed, of course.

     The victim is allowed a special Intelligence check: the roll is modified
by  adding  the  victim's  Wisdom and subtracting the spellcaster's  Charisma
(Comeliness  if  that  statistic  is used).  The  spell  is  effective  until
dispelled.

      While  under the enchantment, the victim will take as gospel everything
the  spellcaster says, and will strive to protect and defend the  spellcaster
at  all times. If the spell is broken by another magic or by the will of  the
enchanter,  however, the victim will remember everything and know that  magic
was involved.

This  spell invokes a sphere of daylight that passes through creatures, walls
or  even  the  ground as if they did not exist. Thus, there  are  no  shadows
within the sphere, which denies thieves their hide in shadows ability - and a
shadow (the monster) is easily detectable. A shadow will try to flee the area
as  quickly  as  possible as it is completely against  its  nature.  Daylight
causes  a  little harm to several other undead. It causes spectres to  become
powerless  as within full daylight but they can still flee from its  effects.
It  causes vampires no harm but makes them quite irritable. Liches  sneer  at
such  a  feeble attack. Some other undead might be affected (DM's judgement).
It might also be damaging to some fungi.

The   material   component  is  a  continual  light  scroll   plus   oil   of
bioluminescence (gained from glow bugs).

This  is essentially telepathy with a corpse, as the wizard probes the  brain
of  the  deceased  for specific data. The DM must decide if  the  information
sought  is  basic, well known, merely known, or forgotten.  The  table  below
lists  the chance of finding the information and the amount of time  required
by  the search (if location is in fact possible), but the DM can alter  these
numbers if the body is in a particularly advanced state of decomposition.

     Type of   Chance of Time
     Information    Finding   Required  Examples
     Basic     96%  1    Name and profession
     Well Known     70%  2d4  Relating to
                    current mission
     Known     30%  3d4  Relating to
                    previous missions
     Forgotten 2%   1d10+10   Overheard once

This  spell  will continue as long as the wizard concentrates, but  on  every
round  there is a 1% chance of that he will go insane. The material component
is a pair of metal helmets, linked by a copper wire.

Victims  of this spell are forced to dance uncontrollably, much like stringed
puppets.  This jerking movement is so unnatural that creatures are  prone  to
hurt  themselves.  For  each  round under the influence  of  this  spell  the
creature takes 1d6 damage from torn ligaments and wrenched muscles. Creatures
affected  by this spell are unable to take any action other than  dance,  but
this requires the complete concentration of the caster, so the wizard can  do
nothing  but control the dancers. If concentration is broken the  caster  can
regain  it  anytime the dancers are within 40 yards. This spell  will  effect
undead but not oozes or automatons.

The  material components of this spell are 4 pieces of string attached  to  2
small sticks.

When  this spell is cast, the caster's face momentarily bloats and rots. This
putrid visage is not an illusion. Those within the area can smell the rotting
flesh  and hear the squirming grubs crawling from various orifices.  Just  as
quickly  as  the face rotted, it repairs itself, grubs falling to the  ground
and skin growing back. Victims must be in front of the caster in order to  be
affected.
This  ephemeral spectacle is so horrifying that those seeing it must save  or
stand  in  shock for 1d3+1 rounds. Non-intelligent creatures those unable  to
see, undead, and opponents with more Hit Dice than the caster are immune.

The material component is a live caterpillar.

This  spell creates a pulsating ball of light floating 5 feet off the  ground
that  slowly  drains the life from all within 10 feet. Those in the  area  of
effect  take  1d4 dam a round. The star will drain life from anything  within
its  area  of  effect including plants, animals, even the  spellcaster.  This
spell cannot damage creatures without life such as undead and automatons.
The star cannot be damaged. It will only leave if dismissed by the caster  or
dispelled. Note it does not move.

The material components are a drop of swamp water and a pinch of dirt form  a
fresh grave.

At  the culmination of this dreadful spell, the priest utters a deafening cry
or  shriek which is heard by one creature within area of effect per level  of
the  priest.  Those  hearing the spell must save versus death  magic  or  die
instantly. Creatures who cannot hear (due to ear plugs, deafness,  etc.)  can
be targets, but are considered to automatically make their saving throws.
This  spell is most often cast over the body of a slain comrade in an  effort
to  slay those responsible for the death and in mourning for the lost friend.
Since the use of this spell attracts the attention of the priest's deity, and
because  the deaths result from the deity sharing in the grief of the priest,
the  spell  works only if the priest is truly mourning the lost  friend,  and
only  if  the  deity  approves  and joins the priest.  Those  creatures  most
directly  responsible  for  the  death  of  the  comrade  are  slain   first,
thereafter, victims are chosen at random. The priest is never the  victim  of
his own death wail.
This  spell  need  never be prayed for by the priest,  however,  seven  spell
levels of available spells are drained from the priest's mind (beginning with
the  highest  level spells available). If the priest has fewer than  7  spell
levels  remaining, he takes 1d6 points of damage for every spell  level  less
than 7 currently memorised.

It  is  only a god of war or death, or a perverse deity that will  allow  his
followers to use a spell such as this.
The  spell is cast when the priest has been struck his death blow. The  spell
cannot  be  cast  if the priest is knocked below his level  in  negative  hit
points in any one round. The spell can be cast even if the priest had already
cast a spell in the combat round. It is very difficult for the priest not  to
get the spell off.
The  effects  of the spell occur immediately. The priest has all  his  spells
memorised, and his level and hit points are doubled for the duration  of  the
spell.  The  priest  cannot have more spells than his  level  would  normally
allow. The priest will fight insanely and attack all foes in sight until  the
spell  ends,  the priest dies again, the priest casts another  death  warrior
spell, or the spell duration ends.
When  the  spell  finally  ends, the priest immediately  dies  and  the  body
vanishes,  not to be found again. The deity personally collects the  soul  of
the priest.
A priest will normally use the spell only if he thinks that there is a battle
that he will not survive, and thus try to use this spell for a last revenge.
The priest cannot be brought back to life, but if a group of adventurers went
and petitioned the deity of the priest, then the deity may decide to free the
priest's  soul in exchange for a service (a suitably long quest will  usually
do).
The spell, when cast, causes the priest's holy symbol to destroy itself in  a
dramatic  manner  (blows up in a flash of light and sound, melts,  etc.)  but
this  causes no other effects. If the spell is to be cast a second time, then
the priest will require a second symbol.

This  spell  causes a magical black-greyish wind in the area of effect.  This
wind  has  a range of 20 yards per level. It has a direct connection  to  the
negative  energy plane. For every round in the wind a character has  to  save
twice  versus death magic. If they succeed twice, they don't suffer any spell
effects;  if they save only once, they suffer "only" a 1d3+1 level  loss;  if
they  fail twice, they lose 1d6+1 levels. For every level lost, the character
suffers  5d4 hit points additional damage (due to the excruciating pain  with
which  these  levels  are lost), with a saving throw versus  spell  for  half
damage.
The  order  in which they lose their hit points is the following: first,  you
lose any applicable level hit points lost due to energy level loss, then  you
lose hit points due to the damage accrued by energy level loss.
Any  people  killed by the energy level loss change into juju zombies;  those
killed  by  the damage (after they lost their levels) are changed into  half-
powered  juju  zombies. Anyone who survives this spell will regain  the  lost
levels  slowly  (one per hour until the previous maximum is reattained).  The
damage stays the same, as this was additional to the energy level loss.
Negative  plane  protection or a similar spell or  item  effect  offers  full
protection  against this spell. Anyone within the full effect of dispel  evil
or  a  protection  from evil, 10-foot radius cast by a priest  of  fourteenth
level or higher is also protected.
As  the  caster needs direct access to the negative energy plane, he  is  not
able to have any protection or other permanent spells going on his person  at
the time of casting, as this would disrupt the frail link. The only spell  he
requires  is negative plane protection or an item which helps him offset  the
drain of the negative energy plane.

The  material  component is a sacrificed baby (less than 6  months  old),  an
active  phylactery of a lich, and the full dust from a 500 year old  vampire.
The  material components are completely destroyed during the casting. In  the
first round of casting the lich (whose phylactery is used) knows with a  100%
certainty  where,  by  whom,  and for what the phylactery  is  used  and,  if
possible,  it will most certainly jump in to prevent the destruction  of  its
phylactery.

This  spell  is  a variant of Maximillian's earthen grasp from  the  Tome  of
Magic. Except where noted, this spell duplicates the effects of Maximillian's
earthen grasp.
When  this  spell is cast, rather than producing an earthen hand, this  spell
causes  many  undead arms to spring from the ground underneath  the  target's
feet. If the 's saving throw is successful, then the arms sink into the earth
and  the  spell progresses as per the spell description. If the target  fails
his  saving throw, undead forms resembling zombies burst up from the  ground,
lashing out at the target to grasp and hold him with unyielding strength.
The  Armour Class of the arms or creatures is 6 (as opposed to the  AC  5  in
Maximillian's earthen grasp). The hit points of the undead forms created  are
equal  to twice the wizard's normal hit points up to a maximum of 40 HP.  The
undead  forms created are unturnable, and at the end of the spell's  duration
will sink down into the earth from whence they came.
If  this spell is cast in a graveyard, the soil of the graveyard will be more
likely  to  produce  the  undead forms in a quick, unexpected  manner.  Thus,
saving  throws  against this spell would be at -1 and  the  chance  that  the
undead  hands  or forms reappear under the target's feet after  a  successful
saving throw is 10% per level of the wizard rather than 5% per level which is
the usual chance for this occurrence if cast in other environments.

A  very  potent and deadly spell, deathwalk should be used only when a  long-
term  damaging effect is desired. The creature affected is, quite simply,  no
longer  able to fall into a normal unconscious sleep. If sleep is  cast  upon
the  affected creature or the creature is otherwise affected in  such  a  way
that  unconsciousness  would  result, the  creature  falls  into  a  restless
unconscious  gaining  no benefits from it. For every 3 consecutive  days  the
creature  is unable to sleep, all abilities temporarily drop by 1  point  and
1d4  HP  are temporarily lost, however no abilities can drop below 2 and  hit
points cannot be reduced to 0. The incoherentness and sluggishness eventually
gets  to the point where the creature is must keep bed, and can barely  move.
In  this  way,  deathwalk releases its true powers because  if  the  creature
cannot  eat  or perform other necessary bodily functions especially  that  of
proper health care, death ensues. After eight consecutive days without sleep,
the creature must make a successful saving throw versus paralysation each day
or  fall into a restless coma. The material components for this spell  are  a
black  shroud, which burns while the spell is in effect, and a small  crystal
sphere that essentially traps the spirit and essence of the affected creature
within it.

This spell is similar to silence, 15-foot radius but instead of silencing  an
area, it affects singular creatures and their equipment. Note that this spell
must  be  cast upon living creatures (including plant-life) only and  has  no
effect upon non-personal equipment. Thus if the spell were cast upon a guard,
and  that guard struck a gong, the gong would sound, while if the guard where
to  try  blowing a horn, no sound would issue forth. The caster may  end  the
spell any time prior to the duration. The material component of this spell is
two small pieces of cotton.

This  spell  causes a temporary sensory overload to occur in all the  sensory
nerve  endings of the target creature. Because of this overload  of  all  the
senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, hearing), the target will be "burnt  out"
for  the duration of the spell. The creature will find himself in a state  of
total  sensory  deprivation for the spell's duration.  This  means  that  the
creature  will  not be able to see, hear, taste, feel or smell anything.  The
creature will remain completely helpless for the duration.
There  is  an additional side effect of this spell. Because the loss  of  the
senses  can  be so shocking an experience to some creatures, there  is  a  1%
chance  per  point of Intelligence and Wisdom that the creature  will  suffer
from  the insanity of catatonia for a duration of 2d4 weeks afterwards.  This
can be cured with a cure insanity.
If  the creature makes its saving throw versus spell, then the spell does not
completely  take  effect.  Only  1d4 of the creature's  senses  are  affected
(determine  randomly which). Note that some combination of lost senses  could
leave the creature helpless anyway.

The  material  components for this spell are a small leather hood,  a  shrill
whistle, several sharp pins, smelling salts, and a drop of lemon juice.

By means of a piece of wood and the gestures and phrases of casting, a magic-
user  can  create a temporary "ten-foot pole" of force with this  spell.  The
material component is instantly consumed, and from the caster's forefinger  a
two-inch  radius, ten-foot long, faintly glowing beam of force  springs  into
being.  It  moves as the finger is pointed, and lasts as long as  the  caster
wills  (or  until  the  spell expires, whichever occurs first),or  until  the
spellcaster  casts another spell. The pole cannot be cut -  any  metal  which
passes  through  it will cause it to harmlessly wink out of  existence  -  or
bent, but will support any weight. It also cannot be shortened; if it strikes
an  obstacle,  the caster must move it, or the obstacle, or will  it  out  of
existence,  to  proceed. It cannot be removed from the end  of  the  caster's
finger, although the caster (and other creatures) can grasp it.
The  staff can be used as a weapon, for 1d6 damage, by sweeping it from  side
to side, or jabbing it forwards, by movements of the caster's guiding finger.
Normal to-hit rolls apply; it is considered a magical weapon with no plusses.
Note that no shock or blow felt by the magical staff is felt by the finger. A
creature  grasping the staff must exert a total of 18 Strength to hamper  its
movements. Once only, if the caster wishes, a decastave can be used to rob  a
target  of  1d4 HP and transfer them to the wielder of the staff. The  target
must be touched by the end of the staff (to-hit roll required) and the caster
must  will  the  staff to drain energy. It will vanish in a pulse  of  force,
draining  1d4  HP  (no saving throw) and transferring them instantly  to  the
caster. If the caster is uninjured, excess hit points are lost after 1  turn.
Any  damage incurred by the caster during that time is first taken from these
phantom hit points; if the caster is at less than full hit points at the  end
of  the turn and phantom hit points remain, all remaining points are absorbed
at  that  time as healing, any excess being lost. The excess hit  points  can
never  be transferred to any other creature. Such phantom hit points  do  not
confer any higher-level or hit-dice saving throw bonuses on the caster.

When this spell is cast, the wizard collects and controls a powerful negative
energy force that will decay flesh upon contact. This force will be seen as a
shadowy darkness enveloping one hand. The spell remains in effect for 1 round
per  level or until the caster touches someone. The victim must save or watch
a  random  limb wither away. creatures with decayed limbs are unable  to  use
them  for 1 hour per caster level. It is not possible to kill a creature with
this  spell  since  it will not decay the head or torso. Undead,  automatons,
jellies and anything without limbs are immune to this spell.

The material components are a poisonous mushroom and a pinch of mould.

This  prayer  causes the area of effect to turn into a poisonous swamp.  Even
worse,  the swamp is not visible. However, true seeing or similar magic  will
detect the swamp. Since it is not just a large trap, thieves cannot detect it
(supposing they have no true seeing ability or the like).
The  priest first chooses the area of effect. Then, he drops some poison  and
water to the ground. Meanwhile, he utters the prayer. The ground now turns to
swamp (anyone can detect it as being a swamp at this time) and starts looking
as it was before one round later (no-one can recognize it as a swamp from now
on).
To  successfully chant this prayer, the ground must be at least 10 feet thick
(so  you  can't build a swamp in a castle's third floor if the great hall  of
the  knights  is below one foot of stone). Only stone, earth,  rock,  mud  or
other  similar material can be used to create a swamp on. A swamp  cannot  be
build  in  a marsh or on another swampy area. The priest can choose  a  swamp
size  from  a  minimum  of 10 10 feet up to his maximum  (eg.,  a  priest  of
fifteenth  level  could create a 10 150-foot or a 100 15-foot  swamp,  always
being 10 feet deep, but he also could create a 13 67-foot swamp).
A victim who didn't see the swamp and steps into it, falls into it (no saving
throw  allowed). If the victim succeeds a swimming check (at a   4  modifier,
since it's a swamp and not water) it only suffers 2 points of damage from the
poison.  The  poison enters the body of the victim through the skin.  If  the
victim  fails,  it  suffers  additional 1d8  points  of  damage  and  gets  a
cumulative  1 penalty to its next swimming check (in the next round). Victims
without the swimming proficiency automatically suffer 1d8+2 points of  damage
each  round.  If  a  victim spends 5 rounds in the swamp  it  loses  Strength
(reduced  to  3)  and sinks to the swamp's ground. There, it  suffers  double
damage  (2d8+4) each round. After another 5 rounds down there it will finally
die.
Victims  can  be pulled out of the swamp by others very simply:  by  using  a
rope,  a  branch, a long weapon (lance or the like) and a successful Strength
check  (both the one who pulls and the one who is being pulled must succeed).
It  is  not possible to cast spells with somatic or material components while
held in the swamp.
If  the swamp is turned back to its former condition, turned to stone or rock
by  magic, or a similar action takes place, then all who are in it are thrown
out and suffer 4d8 points of damage.
The  material  components for this spell are a drop of poison  from  a  giant
scorpion and some water.

With this new defense, the Psionicist can deflect any unsuccessful
attack  against the attacker. The attacker is allowed a  save  vs.
petrification, but if he fails, he suffers any result from his own
attack  as  if  he is using it versus a contacted  mind.  (e.g.  a
Psionicist  is  using 'Ego Whip' and the defender  is  using  this
Science  and  wins, the Psionicist is dazed for 1d4 rounds  if  he
fails his save.)

Power  Score:   The save automatically fails (if  the  contest  is
won).

20:  The contact is established without any further combat.

This spell is similar to the 5th-level deflect normal weapon attacks with the
following exceptions: the forcefield's Armour Class is 2 and it has 7 HP  per
level of the wizard. It affects all attacks made via a magical or non-magical
melee or missile weapon. A non-magical weapon cannot affect or penetrate  the
barrier  in  any way. If a magical weapon strikes the barrier,  the  target's
saving  throw (to determine penetration or deflection) has a penalty  applied
to  it, equal to the bonus of the weapon (i.e. a weapon, +2 that scores a hit
on  the  barrier  inflicts  a -2 penalty on the protected  creature's  saving
throw). Also, if a magical weapon is reflected back at the attacker (when the
barrier is not hit), the weapon bonus is not applied to the reflected attack.
In addition to its other powers, this spell may affect magic missile attacks.
It  does  not  automatically negate them as a shield  does,  but  causes  the
attacker  to make a to-hit roll against the barrier. If the attack  succeeds,
the barrier automatically takes damage (the recipient earns no saving throw);
if  the attacker fails to score a hit, the magic missile has no effect. Other
spells  will  pass  through the barrier, without affecting it.  The  material
component for this spell is a powdered black sapphire which is consumed  when
the spell is cast.

When  cast,  this  spell creates an invisible, mobile forcefield  around  the
recipient.  This barrier has an Armour Class of 4 and a number of hit  points
equal  to  5  times  the wizard's level. All non-magical  melee  and  missile
attacks made on the recipient, are directed against the shell instead. Damage
from  such  attacks will not harm the recipient until the wall is  destroyed.
This spell has no effect on any magical attacks, which inflict full damage on
the barrier and the recipient.
If  an  attack  hits the barrier, the protected creature must make  a  saving
throw  versus  spell. If this saving throw fails, damage is  rolled  normally
against  the  forcefield  (if  the damage inflicted  equals  or  exceeds  the
remaining hit point total of the wall, it is destroyed, but any excess damage
does  not  affect  the  recipient  at this time).  If  the  saving  throw  is
successful, the attack is deflected away harmlessly.
an attack fails to score a hit on the barrier (i.e., misses AC 4), the attack
is  reflected back at the attacker; the attacker must then make normal attack
and damage rolls against himself. The material component for this spell is  a
powdered black opal which is consumed with the casting.

      This  spell causes all normal, stationary plants in an area to turn  to
grass.  The  affected area's topography remains unaltered,  and  many  stones
still need to be removed before crops can be planted.

      Deforest  can affect a region of up to 100 square feet or a 5-foot  per
level  radius  area. Thus, a 1st-level wizard can clear  a  circle  ten  feet
across,  and  so  on.  The  dimensions of the area can  be  altered  to  make
elongated rectangles, so that straight paths and roadways can also be cleared
by  this method. Any plant whose roots are inside the area of effect are also
considered  inside,  so  a well placed casting could actually  clear  several
large trees instead of one or two.

      The  spell, if used in radius format, centres on the caster, and if  in
square  or  rectangular format, begins directly in front of  the  caster  and
clears an area as wide as desired (up to the limits) for as far as it can  go
in a straight line.

      Mobile plant-like monsters, such as shambling mounds, are unaffected by
the spell. However, plant-like monsters which have a root system, such as the
snapper saw or tri-flower frond, must save versus spell or receive 1d4 points
of  damage  per level of the caster. For every 8 points the plant  loses,  it
also  permanently loses one Hit Die. If the plant is killed by the spell,  it
is also turned to grass. If not, it remains and may heal damage up to its new
Hit Die total.

This spell allows the caster to impose a penalty to turning equal to half his
level, so a 20th-level necromancer would totally nullify the turning attempts
of a 10th-level priest. The spell affects all evil extraplanar creatures that
can see the caster. The material component of this spell is a holy symbol  of
some  evil  god  (not necessarily the caster's own). It is  consumed  in  the
casting.

This spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 15d6)
to  any creature that is water-based or has a substantial amount of water  in
its  system. Thus, for example, spectres, stone golems and air elementals are
immune to this spell. Creatures that dwell primarily in water save at -1  and
those from the elemental plane of water save at -2 and take +1 on each die of
damage.

This  spell will cause a creature successfully touched by the priest to  lose
nearly  all water suspended in its body. An option for the priest is  to  use
his  waterskin, into which he may send the displaced water, filling the  skin
(but  not overflowing). The priest must by holding the skin in one hand while
touching  the target for this to occur. Otherwise, the water is sent  to  the
plane of water.
The  effects  on  the target of this spell are that they take  an  extra  1d4
damage  from  slashing attacks, 1d6 from bludgeoning attacks,  and  no  extra
damage  from piercing attacks. They cannot heal normally and must drink  some
water within 24 hours or die, and a few gallons to recover (I don't know  the
exact amount that the body holds). In addition if no water is received in  12
hours then there is a failure of the stomach system (alimentary canal, if you
want to be technical) and the character must make a Constitution check to eat
without  vomiting, thus requiring a healing spell; or weeks of  light,  salty
foods  to  try  to  heal  naturally.  Each  failure  lowers  the  character's
Constitution  for the next eating attempt, if the adjusted Constitution  goes
to  zero then that character may not eat until cured. There is also a  chance
of  chronic diarrhoea setting in if not given water within 12 hours  (make  a
Constitution check) whereupon then the character's Constitution is reduced by
two for a week after a normal diet has returned.
This  spell will not affect creatures without non-negligible water  contents,
this  being  DM's discretion. Magical water creatures are allowed two  saving
throws,  the  first  a regular saving throw, then, if failed,  an  additional
saving  throw versus death magic. If both fail, the creature is killed  (this
spell could kill a nereid).

This spell links the life force of the caster with the power of a chosen god.
Once  the  link has been created nothing can break it short of  the  duration
elapsing.
The spell's chance of success is determined by the following:

     Category of god     Chance of success
     Demigod   95%
     Minor god 75%
     Major god 55%

The bind offers the following benefits to the caster:
          The caster cannot be charmed, held, or even soul trapped.
           The caster knows all information that comes into the consciousness
of the linked god: this is similar to a "divine ESP".
           Spells  of higher than third level cast by priests of the  "linked
god" do not affect the recipient, healing spells included.
The bind presents the following problems:
           If  the recipient is killed before the spell expires, the  god  is
killed as well.
          If the linked god is killed before the spell expires, the recipient
dies as well.
           The recipient permanently becomes the alignment of the linked god;
if not already.
Obviously  any  given  god  will  not want to be  bound  without  appropriate
compensation.  But  if  the spell is cast correctly, the  chosen  god  cannot
prevent the link. If the spell is successful and the link is established, the
god  will,  of  course,  do the best they can to keep the  spell's  recipient
alive.
Finally, there are always those religious fanatics who will seek out  a  god-
linked individual to kill them, hoping to eliminate a rival god.
The  spell  must  be  cast in a sanctuary of the intended god.  The  material
component  is  an  appropriate symbolic offering to get the god's  attention;
possibly a rare gem, artifact, or notable sacrifice.

This  spell throws the victim back to the location he occupied at a point  in
the  recent past. It does not turn back time, it merely teleports back  along
the  victim's  "time  line". This restriction makes the resistance  that  the
magic must overcome much less than a full teleport other would have to fight.
Deja  vu  sends the victim to the position he occupied 1d6 hours in the  past
per level of the wizard.
If  the  victim would be placed inside another object or creature, the victim
is  placed  in  a random direction along his time line until an  unobstructed
location  is found. The material component is a timekeeping device  which  is
destroyed at the time the spell is memorised by the wizard.

This spell creates a snowball (q.v.) with a +1 on each of its dice of damage.
The spell will not release its burst for one tenth of a round up to 5 rounds,
according to the command upon casting. In other respects, this spell  is  the
same as the 3rd-level snowball (cf. delayed blast fireball).

Casting  this spell requires a demon's amulet of at least a type  one  demon,
which  is  slowly  consumed and will be destroyed when the  spell  ends.  The
caster  of  this  spell is rendered invulnerable to all demonic  powers,  but
physical  attacks  are  not  affected. The caster cannot  be  telekinesed  or
charmed  by  demons,  their unholy words won't affect him,  etc.  No  demonic
special powers can harm him at all.
The tougher the demon's amulet, the longer the spell lasts:

This  powerful attack spell is used exclusively against natives of the  lower
planes. Against other creatures, it is absolutely harmless. When the spell is
cast,  a  star  appears in the hand of the wizard, and travels at  very  high
speeds  to  implant  itself  on  the  creature's  forehead,  or  the  nearest
equivalent of a forehead. Then the star starts to glow very brightly and with
great heat. The demon gets to make his magic resistance roll, but at -30%. If
he fails his saving throw, he gets a saving throw versus spell every round to
reduce some of the spell's effects.
The  star  does 10d6 HP of damage per round, and immobilises the  demon  with
pain. The saving throw is for half damage and the ability to act, despite the
pain. The spell also blocks any gate attempts by the demon. This blocking  of
gate  attempts  stops when the spell duration is over or the demon  is  dead,
whichever comes first.

The material component of this spell is a golden star.

#9#
This  power allows a psionicist to alter the density of an  object
so  that  it weighs anywhere between half the original  weight  or
double the weight.  This confers a -2 to hit penalty if used on  a
weapon  because of the changed weight.  This, if used on an arcing
missile  like an arrow or a catapult, or some kind of  bludgeoning
weapon, will cause double damage because of the excess weight  (if
the  weight was doubled ) or half damage (if the weight is halved)
It  will also change the range in the opposite way that the damage
was  changed (ie. An arrow is doubled in weight and causes  double
damage,  but  has half the range)  This also gives  a  -4  to  hit
penalty  when first using the altered missiles, but  after  a  few
test shots (usually around 5) the penalty goes to the regular -2.

Power  Score:   The change can be anywhere from  one  quarter  the
weight  or  as  much as 4 times the weight.  The bonuses/penalties
are also altered in the same way.

20:  The object changes in the opposite way intended.

This  spell  when cast will instantly destroy one object. The  caster  merely
needs  to cast the spell, and touch the object to be destroyed with his  holy
symbol. If the object is being held by another creature, the caster can touch
the  creature, and the intended object will be destroyed. The  spell  can  be
carried  through  any  number of touching objects. For  example:  a  rope  is
attached  to  a grappling hook. The caster can touch the rope to destroy  the
hook, without destroying the rope.
This spell will not destroy magical items, or any living or undead creatures.
if  the  object  is  being carried by a creature, the  object  saves  as  the
creature.  No  damage will be done if the saving throw is  made.  Should  the
object  destroyed  be dangerous, such as a flask of acid, the  contents  will
spill  on  the  owner  doing half damage. A flask of oil  however,  will  not
ignite,  as  most things will simply turn to dust (however, the creature  may
end up covered in oil).

This spell enables the spellcaster to recognize useful components for spells,
spell  research,  and creation of magical items, potions and  scrolls.  These
components  may  be natural ingredients for spells, parts of monsters  useful
for  potions or other magical items, and so forth. If the spellcaster is able
to  cast  the  spell  the components are necessary for, or  has  created  the
magical  items  that  incorporate the components,  or  has  similar  specific
information  of what the components are used for, then the exact part  needed
will be illuminated and the spellcaster will recall the exact purpose of  the
component  and  proper methods needed to preserve and prepare it.  Otherwise,
vague  feelings  will  be  given about what parts are  generally  useful  and
whether a certain method of transporting them is bad or good. A sage or  some
other such person will have to be consulted for more specific knowledge.

When cast, detect curse enables the priest to detect the existence of a curse
on  the creature or object, such as a cursed sword. The spell will detect the
first cursed creature or object that lies along the casting priest's line  of
sight  (and within range) with a base chance of 50%. An extra 1% is added  to
the base chance for each level of experience of the casting priest. Note that
stone of more than 1 foot thickness or metal of any thickness will block  the
spell.  The material components of the spell are the priest's holy or  unholy
symbol and a crushed sapphire of at least 1000 gp value.

By  casting this spell, the priest may determine whether there are  creatures
within the area of effect that bear hostile intent toward him. The spell will
reveal  the direction of the creatures, even if they are invisible, ethereal,
astral, or out of phase. Note that this spell does not reveal anything  about
the  alignment or motives of the creatures in concern. The material component
of this spell is a miniature spy-glass of any material.

This  is  actually  not so much a spell as it is a class  of  spells.  Detect
individual  spells  are  keyed to detect the presence  and  location  of  one
specific  being,  and must be researched as new spells  for  each  being.  To
successfully  cast detect individual, a piece of the being is required.  This
spell will penetrate nearly all forms of invisibility or non-detection.
When  found,  95% of the time, the characters will happen on a spell  written
for  some being. 5% of the time, a set of guidelines and notes will be  found
which can cut the research time in half.

      With  this power a psionicist can detect invisible creatures
and  objects.   The power relies on the fact that invisibility  is
never  perfect, and always gives a slight shimmering effect.  When
in  use,  this  power enhances the ability of  the  psionicist  to
detect this effect, and allows him to see the invisible thing as a
light gray blob.
     If the invisible body is moving, the psionicist automatically
detects  it.   If it is standing still (an inanimate  object,  for
example), the psionicist must roll a second successful power check
to detect it.
     This power does not allow a psionicist to see in the dark. In
f  since it's based on visual perception, it doesn't work as  well
when  there  is  not enough light. The following table  gives  the
chance to detect invisibility (for a moving object) as well as the
to-hit penalty in various light conditions.

Condition Penalty   Chance to Detect
Clear day 0    100%
Twilight  -1   80%
Moonlight -2   40%
Starlight*     -4   10%
Total darkness -4   0%
     * In starlight the psionicist has a small chance of detecting
the   invisible creature, but he must concentrate on it, and  thus
does not gain any bonus to hit.

Power Score:  The psionicist sees an inanimate object with no need
for a
power roll.

20:   The  psionicist  cannot see one object or  creature  in  his
vicinity for 1d6 rounds.

sense at will one attribute per level above third, noting such attributes  as
number, degree (size), concentration (power), and location. Diviners may also
focus  in on a particular aura and sense at will one "colour" per level above
seventh, noting such features as kingdom (animal, plant, etc.), state  (live,
undead,  divine, etc.), form (gaseous, liquid, solid), and extension  (prime-

This spell is just like detect magic except that it is more sensitive, has  a
longer area of effect (60 yards for detect magic), and that the wizard is  be
able  to  determine  accurately what kind of magic  (alteration,  divination,
conjuration, etc.) is in effect if the magic is within 60 yards  +  10  yards
per  level. This spell will not blind, hurt, etc., anyone. If in an  area  of
extreme magic, the wizard will simply know that stronger magic is in effect.

When this spell is cast, the wizard can see and perceive any creature that is
out  of or in a different phase than that of the wizard. This means that  the
wizard will see clearly such creatures with special defenses as displacement,
blinking, duo-dimension, astralness or etherealness, and those who can  shift
out of phase, such as a phase spider. Furthermore, if the wizard has means to
attack  such creatures, he will suffer none of the ill effects that  normally
occur  when trying to attack (i.e., the wizard would know the exact  location
of  a  displacer  beast, or where the phase spider is etc.). The  information
cannot be communicated to his fellows by words.

The material component of this spell requires a lens of calcite crystal which
must be viewed through for the spell to have effect. It does not disappear at
the end of the spell. Some wizards have made spectacles of calcite crystal so
they would have there hands free to do other things after casting the spell.

will  have none of the ill effects that normally occur when trying to  attack
(i.e., the person touched would know the exact location of a displacer beast,
or  where  the phase spider is, etc.). The information cannot be communicated
to anyone else by words. The recipient's sight is limited to 120 yards.

This  spell allows the wizard to find special planar stress points where  the
casting of gate or planar gateway is easily accomplished. This spell searches
through  the  planar structure. The planar stress points occur naturally.  At
these  stress  points, the planar clusters form a natural gap  through  which
travellers might pass. The range depends on the casting time: for every  turn
cast  the  wizard  can search through an area of 100 square miles  per  level
shaped in any shape he desires. Thus, it could be a long thin strip or a true
square  shape that spreads out from the wizard. This might seem rather  large
but  considering that not many natural planar stress points exist, that might
be  relegated. The duration also depends on the casting time: the  effect  of
this  spell  lasts for two rounds per turn of casting time after  the  points
have  been  found and the caster has stopped casting. During  this  time  any
planar stress points in the area of effect glow with magical power. They thus
become  a  beacon  for any creatures looking for them on both  sides  of  the
planes  - and not all of them will be benign creatures. Once a planar  stress
point  is  located the casting time of conjuration/summoning spells  such  as
gate  or  planar  gateway  can be reduced by a  full  50%.  Thus,  a  conjure
elemental  would only take five rounds to cast. The problem with such  stress
points is that there is a 5% chance per turn of the follow-up spell that some
kind  of  creature breaks through the gap created by the follow-up  spell:  a
conjure elemental, cast by a 10th-level wizard would have a 5% chance for the
full  10  turns duration that something breaks through - whether  the  wizard
stops   early   or   not.  The  casting  of  a  conjuration/summoning   spell
significantly weakens the border between the planes. If the caster decides to
use  the  normal  casting time he can receive double the  results:  either  a
double Hit Dice monster, or double the normal number of monsters, etc. but in
that case the chance of breakthrough rises to 20% per turn.
These  stress points are created everywhere one finds an artifact  of  other-
planar power or an item of very strong magical power that links somehow  into
another  plane  (very  strong  means  over  8000  XP  per  item)  or  with  a
concentration of over 20 magic items with planar connections that have a  sum
of over 100,000 XP total.

The  material component for this spell is a magical item of no less than 1000
XP  worth plus a compass made completely from diamond except the needle which
is made from adamantine (no less than 5000 gp).

By  means  of  this spell a wizard can see the true form of any shapechanging
creature. On the first round of viewing, the victim is allowed a saving throw
versus spell. If this saving throw is successful, the wizard will think  that
the  creature cannot shapechange. If the saving throw is failed,  the  wizard
will  know whether the creature has the ability to change form. On the second
round  of viewing, the wizard then sees the true form of the creature.  There
is  only  a saving throw on the first round, not on the second. Note  that  a
wizard  who  knows  polymorph self or shape change  will  be  detected  as  a
shapechanger, even if neither spell is currently memorised (the same goes for
druids  in  their  true  form). This spell will not  detect  or  see  through
illusions.

Spell  casting  leaves a magical residue in the surrounding area  which  this
spell  is designed to detect. When the spell is cast, the wizard can  examine
any  spell that was cast in this area up to a limit of one week in  the  past
per level of the wizard.
One  spell  can  be  examined per round, with the spells  being  detected  in
reverse chronological order. The information obtained about the spell  is  as
follows:
          When cast
          School of magic
          Location and area of effect
          Relative level of the spell
          Casting time and duration
          Relative level of the wizard
          Means of casting
Possible  means  of casting include from memory, from a scroll,  and  from  a
natural power.
If  the  wizard  needs to examine spells farther back in the past,  then  the
spell  can  be repeated within one day, and the wizard can pick up  where  he
left off.

This spell allows the wizard to scan a surrounding area for spells being cast
by  other spellcasters. The affected area has a radius of 10 yards per  level
of the wizard (up to a maximum of 200 yards); the wizard may make the area of
effect smaller if he wishes. Any wizard spells that are currently being cast,
will  be  detected (priestly magic is not affected). The wizard is  instantly
aware  of  the school of magic of all spells in this area; the  name  of  the
spell  will  also be known, if it has already been learned by  thewizard;  in
addition, the wizard gains a general feeling of the location of the caster of
each of the spells (i.e., approximately 30 feet east).
The  relative  strength  of  two spells from the same  school  will  also  be
detected.  For example, if a meteor swarm and a burning hands are both  being
cast  in  the  area of effect, this spell will detect which is more  powerful
(this will also work for two fireball spells cast by two wizards of different
levels);  the  actual level of the spell is not revealed, and two  spells  of
different schools cannot be compared in this way.
The  wizard  may  choose one spell to target for specific  information;  this
includes: the name and level of the spell (as well as the wizard's level,  if
that  is  relevant to the strength of the spell), the spell's target (object,
location, creature, etc.), and the exact location of the wizard. Illusions of
fourth  level or less are revealed, as long as the wizard is of higher  level
than  the  caster of the illusion. Illusions of fifth level  or  higher  will
return  a  false  reading (i.e., what the wizard believes the  spell  to  be)
unless the wizard has already disbelieved that illusion.
This  spell  does  not detect spells which are already  in  effect.  It  does
however  detect  all spells as they are cast, as long as the  duration  lasts
(i.e.,  if  this  spell is cast by a 10th-level wizard, it  will  detect  all
spells that are cast in the following ten rounds).
This  spell  does have a drawback: the maximum number of spells that  can  be
processed  safely  is  equal to the wizard's Intelligence  divided  by  three
(round  fractions down). If there are more than this number of  spells  being
cast  inside  the  area of effect, the wizard must make a  successful  system
shock  roll or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds (this roll must be made  every
round this condition exists).

The material component for this spell is a powered gem worth at least 100  gp
which must be tossed in the air when the spell is cast.

Detects  the  presence of a soul spirit or mentality in any  body  or  object
(enchanted swords and the like), and whether or not the mind controlling  the
body  is its "native". Thus, it will not detect charming or hypnosis but will
detect possession. Only the fact of a mind is detected, not its nature. If it
is  cast  on  a  normally invisible spirit (such as an invisible  stalker  or
unseen  servant), the wizard can see the creature as a visible force for  one
turn per level. The reverse, obscure spirit, has a range of 0 and conceals  a
single mind or spirit from detection by this spell for 24 hours.

This  spell has two uses: if cast on more than one creature, this spell  will
make  the  one  highest in rank known to the priest. If all creatures,  which
must  be in sight, are of equal rank, or there is a tie for the highest rank,
no  one will be detected. Note that the highest in rank need not be the  most
powerful  of  the  scanned creatures. In this case, there  is  no  applicable
saving throw.
The  second  use of this spell is to determine the exact rank of  a  specific
creature: if the spell is cast on one creature only, the priest will know the
rank  of  the  targeted  creature.  If the  priest  is  unfamiliar  with  the
hierarchical structure of the victim's society or organisation, he will  only
feel  a general indication: something like "no rank", "officer" or "very high
rank"  would be appropriate descriptions. Note that nothing is revealed about
the  victim's level of experience and so on. The target gets a saving  throw,
that  will negate the spell. The material component for both versions of  the
spell is a drop of perfume.

creature in relation to the caster. When cast, the DM responds by telling the
player  the target creature's relative power by using phrases such as  "about
the same", "a little worse", "vastly inferior" or "much more powerful".
If  a  saving  throw  is made by the targeted creature,  the  wizard  casting
determine  prowess will always feel as if the target creature is  "much  more
powerful"  or "vastly inferior". The DM can determine randomly or  choose  as
appropriate.
Deity-level  creatures  automatically make their saving  throw  against  this
spell, and are allowed to choose the reading given to the casting wizard.

This  spell allows the caster to charge an item with magical energy and cause
it  to  explode. The item must fit within the area of effect. It the item  is
larger,  only one 5-foot cube per level is affected (part of a wall could  be
blown  out, for example). The spell does not affect living creatures, but  it
does  cause  1d6  points  of damage per level to a maximum  of  10d6  to  all
creatures within 10 feet of the object. The material components of this spell
are burning coal and an eagle's feather.

This spell is capable of returning a creature down the evolutionary scale  to
a form which would be considered a base ancestor of the creature. It can only
be  cast in a laboratory situation where the caster has no outside influences
and the creature is constrained or confined.
The  spell  scans the creature for any and all aspects which can be described
as  a  product  of  evolution or environment in any form, whether  normal  or
magical.   This   includes  Strength,  Intelligence,  Wisdom,   Constitution,
Dexterity,  organizational habits, activity level, diet,  alignment,  natural
Armour  Class,  movement speeds and forms, Hit Dice, natural fighting  skills
(THAC0,  number  of  and attacks and the damage per attack  in  game  terms),
special attacks, special defences, magic resistance, size, grow patterns (for
example, a frog begins as an egg, becomes a tadpole, polliwog, and finally  a
frog),  and spellcasting ability. Also, the caster is able to determine  what
the  lowest  base  form of the creature would be like if all  abilities  were
reverted  back  to  the  most common ancestor of a varied  species.  So,  all
dragons would eventually become some prehistoric lizard, horses would  become
miniature prehistoric ponies, etc.
The  casting  time is one round plus one round for every single  item  listed
above  which the wizard would like to discover (though DMs may want to expand
on  this). During this time no saving throw is allowed to avoid the  analysis
of  the creature in question, although, the creature must be held in relative
security so that the wizard will not be disturbed by any distractions  during
the  casting. An initial check against any magic resistance either avoids the
entire spell or allows it to function.
At  the end of the analysis the wizard may force the creature to revert  back
to  a base form of its evolutionary scale. However, the surgical abilities of
this spell allows the wizard to selectively alter the above listed aspects of
the  creature  to conform to his analogy of what he would like  removed.  For
example, if a wizard somehow captured an adult dragon and was able to analyze
it, he would reduce its strength to that of a small lizard, but then he would
have  the problem of a multi-tonnage creature who was unable to life its  own
weight  unless he also reduced its size. The caster is able to alter 1 aspect
for  every  3 levels of experience at a rate of 1 per round. Any interruption
of  the  spell  during the alterations leaves the creature at  the  state  it
retained  in the previous round. The creature in question receives  a  saving
throw  versus  spell every round a reversion is attempted  (although,  saving
throws  based  upon Hit Dice may change during the casting  of  this  spell).
Success  versus  a  change  in one round does not  prevent  the  wizard  from
attempting the same change the next round.
Surgical  removal can be very selective. Ability scores may only  be  lowered
and reversions should never change more than a single aspect or attribute per
round.  Movement requiring wings may be stripped in one round, but the  wings
would  take another round to remove. Ability scores can be reduced by  1  per
round.  Size  may be reduced by a maximum of 10% per round. Hit points  could
not be affected, though Hit Dice could, therefore lowering the hit points  of
a  creature. Claw attacks could be altered so as to cause a mere 1  point  of
damage  per  strike, or removed altogether (the creature simply  forgets  the
attack  form ever existed). The spell makes no moral alterations  and  cannot
change  attitudes concerning a certain idea. But, alignments can  be  altered
one  step  per  round towards a neutral aspect. The final  product  does  not
register  as being a polymorphed creature (it is a true creature of the  form
it  now  embraces) and as such is unaffected by dispel magic. Devolution  can
also  tell if a creature has been the target of the 7th-level evolution spell
or  any  other  genetic  advancing spells. It may  be  used  to  specifically
counteract  these  effects, essentially returning a creature  to  its  normal
state. DMs should be free to play with the sanity of experiment subjects.

The material component of this spell is a vial of aqua vitae (the essence  of
life),  which  can  only be made by a master alchemist.  Aqua  vitae  may  be
purchased  at the nominal price of 10,000 gp per vial due to its  rarity  and
usefulness in creating artificial life forms. Laboratory, for means  of  this
spell,  simply means a non-combat situation. The source of this spell is  the
Telnorne Mageocrat.

Application  of  this spell increases the Dexterity of  the  character  by  a
number  of points. Benefits of dexterity last for the duration of the  magic.
The amount of added Dexterity depends upon the spell recipient's group and is
subject  to  all restrictions on Dexterity due to race and class. Multi-class
characters use the best die.

     Class     Dexterity Gain
     Priest    1dpoints
     Rogue     1d8 points
     Warrior   1d6 points
     Wizard    1d6 points

The  spell cannot confer a Dexterity of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative with
other magic that adds to Dexterity. Beings without Dexterity scores receive a
+1 bonus to Armour Class and to missile attack rolls.

The  material  of  this  spell is a few hairs, or a  pinch  of  dung  from  a
particularly agile or quick animal.

By  means  of this spell, the priest causes a single weapon to have a  to-hit
(+1)  and  damage (+3) bonus when used against creatures whose  alignment  is
opposed to that of the priest. Thus, if a lawful good priest cast the  spell,
neutral  evil, chaotic evil, and chaotic neutral creatures would be affected.
In  the  case  of  a  neutral good priest, opposing  alignments  are  lawful,
neutral,  and  chaotic evil, and so on for other priests.  If  the  concerned
creature attempts to touch the weapon, it takes damage equal to one hit point
per  level  of the priest (half if a saving throw is made). In  the  case  of
outer-planar  creatures, the to-hit bonus is +3, the  damage  bonus  +5.  The
material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This  spell makes the wizard seem to be inside a varicoloured, shifting  aura
of  light.  He is totally immune to any and all spells and powers which  deal
out  damage using pure energy, like for example energy lance (q.v.),  xag-ya,
or laser rays, and has a magic resistance of 40% + 1% per level of the wizard
versus  "force" spells, like for example wall of force or the  various  Bigby
spells.  Unfortunately, if the force spell is above fourth  level,  both  the
force spell and the energy cloak are negated if the resistance roll is made.
Damage  from impure sources of positive energy (eg. electricity and fire)  is
reduced  by  one point per level of the wizard per round, up to a  cumulative
maximum of 5 times the wizard's level in protected points.
Any  successful  attack  by  a source of negative energy  has  the  following
effects:
          Both the negative attack and the energy cloak are negated.
          Both the cloaked wizard and the attacker take 3d10 points of damage
(no  saving  throw, magic resistance, or other protection). The  attacker  is
only damaged this way if the negative attack was delivered by touch (of body,
wand, or melee weapon). Otherwise, see the next effect, below.
          Everyone not in physical contact with the cloaked wizard takes 3d10
points of damage minus 1 per foot of distance to the cloaked wizard.

The material component for this spell is a small shield.

This  spell requires a gem of not less than 50 gp each time it is  cast.  The
gem's  centre  briefly becomes a minute gate to the positive material  plane,
and  the  energies thus released slowly eat away at the gem from  the  inside
out. When the duration expires or the gem is broken, the gem explodes into  a
sphere  of  pure  energy. The gem must be thrown at  one's  opponents  to  be
effective  (range:  small: 1, medium: 2, large: 3). Inflicted  damage  is  as
follows:

     Distance to Gem
     Impact Place   Damage
     up to 2 feet   4 points per level of wizard
     2-5.9 feet     2 points per level of wizard
     6-10 feet 1 point per level of wizard

The  gem is thrown as a stone for which the wizard has proficiency, and  acts
as  a  grenade-like missile if it misses its intended target. If the  gem  is
thrown  against someone or something (and hits), it will only break instantly
if  it fails a saving throw for ceramic versus normal blow (soft objects)  or
crushing blow (hard objects).

Energy lance is a slow spell that works only at very short distances. If  the
wizard can get it off, though, its results are rewarding. This spell causes a
gem-tipped wand to spew out a directional beam of intense positive energy  at
a  single  object  or creature. Damage done is 1d6 points per  level  of  the
wizard  over  sixth (up to a maximum of 14d6), with no saving throw  allowed.
Additionally,  if made the target of the spell, objects made  of  non-magical
wood, stone, or metal will have a 6 inch hole drilled through them up to  the
maximum  range of the spell (or out the back of the object). Magical  objects
will suffer the same fate unless they successfully save versus disintegration
at +1.

The  material components of this spell are a 6 to 8 inch platinum wand of  at
least 1000 gp value, with a clear diamond or any opal worth 100 gp set on the
e  as well as a loose 100 gp value gem, which is consumed during the casting.
There  is  a  10% chance that the gem on the tip of the wand will shatter  as
well, reduced to 5% for a 1000 gp gem and to a minimum of 1% for a 10,000  gp
value gem.

Note that the casting time of this spell is 3 tenths of a round, not just  an
initiative modifier of 3.
When  this spell is cast, the wizard spreads apart his hands, and a brilliant
net  of positive energies streaks forth to engulf the target. Damage is equal

Furthermore,  the  target is stunned for the rest of the round.  The  maximum

This  spell  creates a vertical disk 10 feet in diameter.  It  is  a  magical
portal to anywhere that is on the same plane, and that the caster had been to
previously.  The  portal clearly shows the other terrain and permits  two-way
travel from either end of the gate to the other. Nonliving material can  only
pass through if carried by a living creature.
The  gateway  does not automatically open to the intended spot.  The  success
roll is dependent on distance to the target:

within 100 miles    99%
within 500 miles    50%
same planet    10%
other planet in same sphere   5%

Thus, an attempted gateway from Waterdeep to Bloodstone would open with  only
a  10% chance of success, while a gateway from the south shore of Nyr Dyv  to
Greyhawk City would be 99% likely to work.
If  the  gateway fails to open properly, there is a 50% chance that it  opens
somewhere else. The exact location can be determined randomly or at the  DM's
discretion, but it need not be near the target spot. It could as easily  open
to  a place a thousand or more miles away as on another planet. In any event,
the  material components, a 6-inch diameter platinum mirror (200 gp or  more)
and  a  diamond-nibbed pen (used to draw the gateway in the air, 1,000 gp  or
more) are consumed by the casting.
The gateway can neither target nor originate from a place that is sealed from
teleportation  or  interplanar travel (eg. areas  guarded  by  some  sort  of
screen, sanctum, etc, or rooms lined with gold or lead).

This  spell has two different manifestations that may be chosen by the wizard
when  the  spell is cast. Both are essentially improvements on the  7th-level
Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion.
Version  1: The area of effect is 300 square feet per level of experience  of
the caster, and the interior can be fully customised. The only changes are as
follows:
          The duration is extended to 4 hours per level of experience.
          The food is safe to eat.
Version 2: The duration stays at 1 hour per level of experience, and the food
retains its properties from the 7th-level version (whatever those might  be).
However, the interior is quite different:
           The  interior floor space is equal to 1200 square feet per  level.
But,  only  the  300  square  feet per level  nearest  the  entrance  can  be
customized  (design, layout, etc.). The remaining 900 square feet  per  level
has  an  entirely random design and layout. Thus, one room might  be  a  bare
storeroom,  while the next could be a lavish greenhouse pool. All rooms  will
be  connected  via  doors of some type to the rest of the complex,  but  they
might  be  secret doors, doors concealed behind furnishings, or secret  doors
hidden behind furnishings. The mansion frequently sprawls in three dimensions
(occasionally more in areas with chaotic magic), so it is very possible  that
connections  between rooms might be stairwells, ladders,  or  trapdoors.  The
caster himself will have no idea whatsoever about the location of these rooms
and doors until he explores them.
           The  only magical servants in this version exist in the 300 square
feet per level section nearest the entrance.
With   either   version,  there  are  indications  that  under  environmental
conditions  manifesting extremely chaotic magic (eg. any of the outer  planes

This spell was designed to allow a wizard to look like something he does  not
for  an extended period of time. It grants the non-magical locomotive powers,
senses, and metabolic processes of the race of creature whose form is  taken.
However,  a  significant  part  of the spell is  dependent  on  the  specific
creature whose shape the wizard wishes to assume. Thus, only one shape may be
taken on by the wizard using this spell - ever.
When  this  spell is found (for instance, on a scroll or in another  person's
spell  book), it already was custom designed by some other wizard to adopt  a
certain  form  (race,  height, weight, hair colour, etc.),  and  nothing  the
finder  can  do  will  make it do otherwise. This is because  the  choice  of
creature  vastly changes the structure of the Monomorph, and thus the  choice
of shape may only be made when researching the spell from the ground up.
When  this  spell is independently researched by a wizard, he gets to  decide
the specifics of the form the spell grants.
If  any  wizard wants to "change" an existing monomorph, so that a  different
shape can be assumed, he must head into a library and research this change as
if  it  were an entirely new spell. The costs for this, though, are  at  -25%
because  the  wizard has a copy of the other form of monomorph  as  a  model.
There  is no reason why a wizard with enough time and money could not possess
several "versions" of this spell.
When  this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of  a  single
bipedal  humanoid (human, demi-human, faerie, goblin, etc.) with  which  race
the  wizard  is  familiar, but not any quadruped (for  example,  a  centaur),
wholly  magical being (for example, a golem or demon), or other creature  not
relevantly  humanoid. The wizard assumes the shape of one such creature  upon
casting the spell, and retains that shape until the spell ceases to function.
He  may  cancel  the  spell  before it would normally  elapse,  but  may  not
alternate  between  the  monomorphed and regular forms  while  the  spell  is
functioning. Monomorph will allow changes as follows:

     Wizard's  Weight    Weight         Maximum
     Level     Minimum   Maximum   Races     Age change
     7-8  -10% +10% as wizard none
     9-11 -20% +25% any known 10%
     12-13     -30% +50% any known 20%
     14-15     -50% +80% any known 40%
     16-17     -70% +125%     any known 60%
     18+  -90% +200%     any known any

The  colour of eyes, skin, and hair can be changed to any possible value,  as
can hair length, sex, and other details.
The  body  whose  shape is assumed has the same physical  statistics  as  the
wizard,  subject to all racial and age modifiers, minimums, and maximums  (of
the form adopted, of course). The new form will not radiate magic, but it may
be dispelled.

This  spell  seals  off an interior area (eg. building, room,  cave)  with  a
volume  up  to  27,000  cubic  feet, from entry by  teleportation  (including
teleport, teleport without error, dimension door, and even Drawmij's  instant
summons and succour), plane shifting (including colour pools, border ethereal
penetration, and plane shift), and similar magical effects.
Any  of  these teleport-like effects may be performed, however, if a password
is  known  and spoken during the attempted entrance. There can  only  be  one
password at a time, but it may be changed by recasting sanctum sanctorum. The
material component for this spell is a platinum lock, inlaid with gems, worth
at least 10,000 gp.

When  spell  analysis  is  cast on an object or  area,  it  lets  the  caster
determine  what  other spells are operational there. In  order  to  correctly
identify each spell that is in effect in the area being analyzed, the  caster
must  make a successful Intelligence check. Thus, if there were three  spells
in  effect  in  the  area in question, the wizard would have  to  make  three
Intelligence  checks.  If he were to make two of the three  rolls,  he  would
learn about two of the three spells. The Intelligence checks are modified  as
follows:

Two to four different spells  +1 to roll
More than five different spells    +2 to roll
Non-detection type spell +3 to roll

"Different  spells"  does not mean multiple spells  of  the  same  type.  For
instance, seventeen magic mouth spells cast on a single statue would  require
17  Intelligence checks but none would be penalized. But if four magic mouths
and  a permanent illusion were cast on the statue, the wizard would make five
Intelligence checks, each at a +1 penalty (only 2 different spells).
"Non-detection type" spell indicates any spell whose primary function  is  to
make  other  divination spells work incorrectly - non-detection, mind  blank,
screen,  etc. This does not include generic abjuration spells like protection
from  evil or globe of invulnerability. Multiple non-detection spells do  not
have  cumulative  penalties: each +3 penalty applies only  to  the  roll  for
analysis of the non-detection type spell.
If a spell is not successfully analyzed, then the caster knows that the spell
is  there but neither learns its name nor its properties. If the caster makes
the  Intelligence check but has never encountered the detected spell  before,
then he learns its name and its basic effects.
Dheryth's  spell  analysis  will also reveal  some  basic  information  about
"triggered"  spells in the area. This is limited to simple  triggers  only  -
some examples are listed below:

Simple Triggers     Complex Triggers
Opening the book    When an elf opens the book
Entering the door   Entering the door without saying "ay"

If  the  trigger  is  complex,  the caster of  analysis  discovers  only  the
simplified  portion of it. Furthermore, if the spell is a  simple  timed  one
(delayed blast fireball, for example) then the caster learns only that it  is
"about  to  go  off"  or "far from going off" or something  like  this,  DM's
discretion.
Finally,  for spells that have several versions (symbol or glyph of  warding,
for  example), the caster of analysis may attempt another Intelligence  check
at an additional penalty of +1 to determine exactly which version is active.

The  material components of this spell are a tortoise shell and a book,  both
of which are consumed in the casting.

This  spell  is cast immediately before any other spell which has a  duration
(there  are some exceptions - see below). It doubles the casting time of  the
other spell and adds verbal and somatic components of its own. The effect  of
spell  support is to make the other spell totally immune to dispel magic  for
its  normal duration. Spell support itself is not dispellable, and if  it  is
cast  in  conjunction with permanency, the net effect is to  make  the  other
spell both permanent and undispellable.
Certain spells (at the DM's option) may not be supported, including at  least
the following ones:
          anything wish or limited wish related,
          prismatic wall and prismatic sphere,
          Otiluke's resilient and telekinetic spheres,
          forcecage and forcecube,
          anything gate related,
          magic jar, and
          temporal stasis.
Spell  support in no way reduces the efficacy of Mordenkainen's  disjunction,
nor does a single casting protect any additional spells that may be active in
the same space.
On  permanency,  there is a 10% chance per year that the spell  support  will
fail,  leaving the permanency intact but unsupported. The wizard has now  way
of detecting that the spell support has failed.

This  spell,  cast upon a volume of rock, prevents the correct  operation  of
transmute rock to mud spell in the following way:
1.  If  the  caster of stone integrity is of higher level than the caster  of
transmute rock to mud, the latter spell automatically fails.
2.  If  the caster of transmute rock to mud is of a level equal to or  higher
than  the  caster  of  stone integrity, the former  spell  has  a  chance  of
correctly operating equal to 10% plus 10% per level that the former wizard is
higher  than  the latter. Even if transmute rock to mud works,  its  area  of
effect  is  reduced  to  a  percentage equal to its chance  of  working.  For
instance, if transmute rock to mud has only a 30% chance to work (and  does),
its area of effect is only 30% of what it should have been.
Stone integrity grants no other bonuses to the rock and may be dispelled. The
reverse  of  this  spell is earth integrity, and prevents  the  operation  of
transmute mud to rock in a manner like above.

With  this  spell, the wizard may detect whether or not a book or  scroll  is
cursed,  what language it is in, whether or not its contents are  encoded  or
enciphered, and other general information about its contents.
None of the following things will be revealed by the spell, though:
      1.   Absolutely nothing will be told about the special books listed  in
the  Dungeon  Master's Guide (a libram of ineffable damnation,  a  manual  of
puissant  skill at arms, etc.). Likewise, very powerful books  (artifacts  or
relics) will be utterly out of this spell's power.
      2.    Specific  spells and scrolls will not be revealed  ("secret  page
spell  on  page 2", "fire trap cast on cover", "explosive runes on  binding",
etc.), nor will the exact nature of a curse, if present, be told.
      3.   If the book or scroll contains spells, the wizard will not be told
precisely which spells are there, although the DM might allow weak statements
like  "20  pages  are devoted to spells", or "a few weak spells  seem  to  be
inside this tome".
The  reverse  of  this spell, tome shield (abjuration), must  be  cast  on  a
particular book or scroll, which is thenceforth immune to Dheryth's  tomelore
for  one  month. It further resists the operation of the history and identify
spells, granting the protected book a saving throw versus spell as if it were
a wizard of the same level as the one who cast tome shield.

The  material component for this spell is a magnifying glass, for the reverse
it is a blank page. Both are consumed in the casting.

This spell turns an ordinary edged melee weapon into a blade of sharpness, as
per  sword of sharpness (see the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 186).  For  the
duration  of the spell, the weapon is treated as a weapon, +3 or  better  for
purposes of who or what can be hit by it, even though it gets only a +1 bonus
to  attack and damage rolls. However, on a very high roll, it will  sever  an
extremity, determined by a dice roll. The spell functions on existing magical
weapons, as long as the total combined bonus is +3 or less.

The  material  component for this spell is a 1000 gp  diamond,  however,  the
tooth  of  a tarrasque may be substituted, in which case the weapon functions
as a vorpal blade (see the same reference as above), and gets the +3 bonus to
attack and damage rolls.

This spell is like the first-level spell except that the fist is a lot larger
(about 6 feet high), and more forceful. The base damage is 2d6 HP + 1 HP  per
level  for  small or medium, and 3d6 HP + 1 HP per level for large creatures.
The  creature  saves  for half damage, and those that fail  are  affected  as
follows:

     Size Effect
     Large     Creature falls down
      Medium     Creature pushed back 1d4+4 feet, Dexterity check to stay  on
feet
      Small      Creature thrown back the number of feet equal to the  damage
they took. They also take another 1d6 points of damage when they land

This  spell  does  not ensure a safe landing, and if the  creature  is  in  a
position where a fall would do extra damage, mounted on a horse, for example,
extra damage may occur. The material component is a carved (or created) stone
hand.

This  spell  literally transforms a tiny portion of the astral plane  into  a
livable space, or pocket dimension, that is only accessible by one gate.  The
position of the gate is determined by the location of the wizard at the  time
of the casting.
When  the spell is cast the wizard indicates what style of climate,  laws  of
physics,  and  laws  of  magic  are desired by the  qualities  of  the  first
component's plane.
Furthermore,  when  the pocket dimension is created,  it  can  contain  crude
unworked structures. Once the plane has been created, other materials can  be
brought in, along with workmen, to detail and furnish any buildings. There is
no limit to the weight that the dimension can hold.
There is no limit to the number of creatures that may dwell there (aside from
a  lack  of  physical space), because of a seemingly inexhaustible amount  of
fresh  air.  However,  plant  life  will not  naturally  develop  within  the
dimension, due to the lack of true sunlight. Therefore, food may need  to  be
brought in on a daily basis, especially if the plane is very crowded.
It is impossible to scry into or out of the plane. However, assuming that the
plane  supports  the  use  of  magic,  scrying  within  the  plane  would  be
acceptable.  The floor and domed walls of the dimension seem  to  be  of  the
hardest stone and cannot be cracked or broken.
Neither  of  the traditional ways of dispelling magic will destroy  a  pocket
dimension or the entrance gate; neither a rod of cancellation, nor  a  dispel
magic.  The  only two ways that the pocket dimension could be destroyed  are:
one,  if  the  second component were shattered or disintegrated,  or  two,  a
planar  disruption (q.v.) were to be cast within the plane. Unlike  when  the
planar  disruption  spell  is  cast  on  a  normal  plane,  the  spell   will
automatically  and utterly destroy the pocket. Regardless, either  method  is
suicide because these methods of destruction are instantaneous if successful,
and the culprits would have to be on the plane.

The  material components for the spell are a piece of natural stone  or  soil
from  an  outer plane, a black sapphire the size of a human fist  (30,000  gp
base),  and  a sanctified holy symbol from the most major god of the  present
pantheon.

Using  this  power a psionicist creates a Dimensional portal  that
will enable the him to bring one item of his choice to his present
location.  Before using this power must think of one item, this is
the  item  he  will use the portal to get.  Using this  power  the
psionicists  need not necessarily know where the  object  he  just
need to be able to picture it in his mind.  He can not think of "I
want  to get a short sword."  It needs to be an object he has  had
physical contact with and knows the feel of it well enough that he
will  know  that  he has found it when his hand goes  through  the
Dimensional  portal  (ie the feel of his favorite  sword,  dagger,
etc.)   This is not an easy task for a psionicist because  of  the
fact  that  he is searching for an object that he does necessarily
know  where  it  is.   The initial cost depends  on  how  far  the
psionicist is from the item (determined by the DM).

This   power  is a variation on the dimensional door  power.   The
Psionicist  defines  two  'windows'  anywhere  within  range,  and
creates  a  two way portal between them, such that anything  going
into  one  of  the  'window'  will come  out  the  other.   Unlike
Dimensional  door,  this power creates a  true two  way  transport
system  (i.e., you can stick your arm through, grab  something  at
the  other end, and pull it back--anything, including spells, will
pass  through both ways).  The windows, which may have an area  of
up  to  4  square feet per level of the  psionicist, are identical
but  can  have any orientation relative to each other (i.e.,  they
could  be  at  right angles to each other, or even at 180  degrees
*).   This   could result in some very strange effects, imagine  a
charging  knight being intercepted by a 'window' and continue  his
charge straight towards the ground - lance first, from  100  yards
up.  Notice that it might be possible to re-route missiles or even
spells  such  as  fireball or lightning bolt  right  back  to  the
originator,  but the psionicist would have to act  extremely  fast
(i.e.,   have  initiative and make an Int  check  to  see  whether
he/she  can think and act fast enough).  Because of the complexity
of warping space in this way it is easy for things to go wrong. If
the  power  check fails, the full PSP's are used, and  a  the  two
windows  will  open  up, but the psionicist cannot  control  their
position (the windows are also unstable and cannot be maintained).
In  case of a 20 result, the windows are 'very likely' to open  in
such  a  way as to harm the  psionicist (in this case, the  window
might also be warped and destroy anything which passes through).

Power Score:  Maintenance cost is reduced to 3 PSP's per round.

     This spell is very similar to the reversed 1st-level priest light spell.
It  has  only  a 2-foot radius, however. This gives the spell many  different
uses.  For  example, it can be used to block the light of a  torch,  lantern,
magic  sword, etc. This would prevent all sorts of vision only within the  2-
foot radius, so one could still see about with infravision or ultravision (or
normal vision, if there is another light source). It can blind a creature  as
a  light spell would without creating light that could alert others, and also
without obscuring the wizard's own sight as would a normal darkness spell (if
cast  upon a creature or its possessions carried, the creature gets a  saving
throw, and if the throw is made, the darkness appears 5 feet behind it).  The
spell  can  cancel  a  light spell, but has no effect on continual  light  or
ambient light.

This  spell  simulates  the  light spell but it can  be  dimmed  to  absolute
darkness (if there is a natural darkness around). Thus, it is very useful for
those  sneaky groups that have always been detected by their light  source  -
until  now.  This  light output can be change from zero to 100%  with  but  a
mental  command of the caster or the recipient - if the recipient is  willing
and  has been given the mental command word. With the exceptions noted  above
it works like the normal light spell.

This spell causes to what appears to be a huge celestial dragon to appear  in
the air and swoop down spewing forth its fiery breath.
The  spell  affects an area of 2 feet wide by 10 feet long per level  of  the
wizard. All creatures in the area of effect take 1d10+2 points of damage from
the  fire.  It  does structural damage to all constructions in  the  area  of
effect.  The damage is 3 HP, 2 HP, 1 HP, or « HP to wood, earth, soft  stone,
or hard stone respectively per level of the wizard.

The  material component of this spell is a scale from a fire-breathing dragon
and a potion of firewater.

This  spell  brings into existence a pair of huge chopsticks, 30  feet  long,
which  attacks  all creatures as if they were AC 10 (modified by  Dexterity).
These giant chopsticks attack with the wizard's THAC0.
Victims  weighing  more than 5 tons are immobilised by the chopsticks,  while
those  of  lesser weight will be picked up, and may be deposited, within  the
same round, at any point in the spell's range. Those who successfully roll to
bend bars manage to free themselves, but they may suffer falling damage as  a
result.
The  wizard  may choose to deposit the victims into a gargantuan mouth  which
appears above his head. This mouth can hold 2 size L, 4 size M, or 8  size  S
creatures  at one time. Each round, the mouth "chews" its contents for  10d10
damage  each. When a creature trapped inside the mouth is reduced to below  0
HP,  the creature is "swallowed" into the astral plane, and more room becomes
available  for  creatures  to be dropped into the  mouth.  Normally,  persons
reduced  to such a hit point score would die in a matter of minutes,  but  in
the  timelessness of the astral plane, they may remain unconscious but barely
alive  for  thousands of years, provided they had more than -10 HP when  they
entered the plane. This, of course, is only valid in campaigns which use  the
optional rule concerning hovering at death's door. If the creature caught  by
the  chopsticks weighs more than 5 tons, then the mouth will move toward  the
trapped creature and start biting it into little pieces until it is all gone.
The spell requires minimal concentration and direction once it has been cast.
This  allows  the wizard to cast other spells, and maintain concentration  on
them instead. If the wizard is killed before the end of the spell's duration,
the mouth and chopsticks will remain, with the chopsticks capturing creatures
that  were enemies of the wizard and depositing them in the mouth when  space
allows.  Naturally,  the  material component of  this  spell  is  a  pair  of
chopsticks.

This  power  allows the psionicist to "disconnect"  a  character's
primary  skills from his mind, causing a specific type of amnesia.
Thus, a fighter has much more difficulty fighting with weapons,  a
mage  has  a  chance of spells malfunctioning,  bards  lose  their
musical and poetic abilities, a psionicist's mental powers  become
harder  to  use.  Characters have no difficulty doing  things  not
"native"  to their class, for example, a mage fight with  weapons,
or  a  fighter  use  a  magic  wand. Multi-class  characters  have
difficulties with the abilities of whichever class has the highest
level  (rolling if two or more are equal), and dual-classed humans
lose the abilities of their current class.
      To  determine the amount of disruption caused by  Disconnect
Skills, take the psionicist's roll and divide by two, rounding  up
the  result (a roll of 4 rounds to 2, a roll of 11 rounds  to  6).
For each disruption point, the character suffers a -1 penalty when
skills measured on a d20 are used, or a -5% penalty when a d100 is
used. The breakdown of vulnerable skills is given by this list:
      Fighter  -  penalty on all attacks and armor class  (-1  per
disruption point)
      Cleric  - chance of spell failure (5% per disruption point),
and turning failure (-1 on turning roll per disruption point)
     Mage - chance of spell failure and magic item failure (5% per
disruption point for both)
      Thief    -  penalty to thieving abilities (5% per disruption
point)
      Psionicist   -  penalty to power checks (-1  per  disruption
point)

Power   Score:   The  victim  cannot  take  any  actions   (except
defending) for the first round.

20:  The psionicist is affected by this power for 2-12 rounds.

Similar to spells such as blindness and deafness, a disease spell will  cause
its  target to believe that he has contracted a real (natural) disease.  Even
though  the  spell affects the mind, the victim believes so strongly  in  the
disease that boils, pains and any other symptoms normally associated with the
affliction   will  be  imagined,  putting  the  individual's   health   under
considerable stress.
If the target has recently been in a situation where contracting a disease is
quite  likely (such as living in filthy surroundings, falling into sewage  or
garbage  heaps, attacks from giant rats or otyughs, etc.), a saving throw  is
made at a penalty of -4; on the other hand, if a character has recently had a
cure  disease cast upon himself, is immune to normal diseases,  or  has  some
other  strong reason to believe that he could not possibly have contracted  a
disease, then a saving throw at +4 or higher (probably +8 if normally immune)
is allowed.
Once  the  spell  takes effect, it is permanent until the victim  receives  a
dispel  illusion. The disease is determined randomly from the  table  in  the
Dungeon Master's Guide (q.v.), with the full effects described affecting  the
target.

By  means  of  this  spell, the caster removes his hands from  his  body  and
controls  them  from  up to 60 yards away. This does not damage  the  caster,
although  it may look strange. The enchanted hands may do anything  that  the
wizard  could  normally  do  with them: attack  (with  or  without  weapons),
manipulate objects, and cast spells that do not require verbal components.
The hands can move up to 90 feet per round, and leap 15 feet. They have AC  7
and  hit points equal to twice the caster's level. The hands attack with  the
wizards  THAC0 and do 1d3 damage per hit. If the hands are killed, they  will
lay  prone  until  the  caster  can recover them,  when  they  will  reattach
themselves and act normally.
The components are a sticky length of gauze and a silver scalpel.

This  spell  changes the appearance, smell, and vocal sounds of the  affected
creature. The size of the creature may be changed up to 2 inches per level of
the caster. The effectiveness of disguising a creature as one of another type
depends on the casters familiarity with the target creature (left to the DM's
discretion). Note that this spell does not imbue any of the racial  abilities
or  resistances of the disguise type creature. The material component of this
spell is a piece of coloured clay.

This  spell  causes  the affected creatures to believe  their  exhaustion  of
combat  has  passed. Thus, they regain 50% of their lost hit points  and  are
able to run at full speed for the duration of the spell. This spell does  not
actually  cause  the  characters to regain their hit  points.  Thus,  if  the
duration runs out and they received additional damage they might die from the
exhaustion. Thus, all characters have to keep two different scores for  their
character's hit points: one real list and one imaginary list (or the DM keeps
it for them). If their real list ever drops to zero and the duration runs out
before  they received real healing they die (or fall unconscious).  If  their
imaginary list ever falls to or below zero, say goodbye to your character, as
he  will drop unconscious from the perceived damage and now the illusion does
not  work any more, so the character immediately loses even those hit  points
he gained from this spell (remember, illusions only function if the character
is  conscious  to perceive them). During the spell, a character  may  act  at
double  speed  for one round once every ten-minute period. This  doubles  all
physical activity but not spellcasting.
If  only for this last effect, the spell may be layered on the same group  up
to  once  per 5 levels of the same caster. It is not possible to  layer  this
spell with the same spell from other casters.
The reverse, exhaust, forces the beings to be affected to make a saving throw
versus  spell  if  they state that they don't believe the illusion.  If  they
don't state that they don't believe it, they get no saving throws - not  even
those  noted  below. If they make their saving throw, nothing happens.  Those
who  make it may communicate the effect to their comrades who tried  to  save
but  failed  if  this  spell has not been coupled with  another  spell  which
normally causes damage. If no other spell that inflicts damage is cast in the
same  round at the same general area, then anyone who has failed their saving
throw  can make an additional saving throw once if another creature they  can
understand  communicates this fact to them If they fail any of  these  saving
throws  (or  never tried to disbelieve) the spell makes the  affected  beings
believe that they have lost 50% of their remaining hit points. This continues
so  far, that they have to make a system shock roll at half Constitution once
they  reach their perceived zero or less hit points. If they fail  they  die.
Even  if  they  make their system shock rolls they drop unconscious  for  the
duration of the spell.

The  material  component for the normal spell is a drop  of  boiled  ethereal
essence  mixed  with  rose oil. For the reverse you need  a  drop  of  frozen
ethereal essence mixed with the crushed remains of three scarabs taken from a
pharaoh's pyramid. How you get ethereal essence? Well, I'm not going to  tell
you!  And  there  aren't that many pharaoh's pyramids  were  the  remains  of
scarabs have prevailed in the fight with Father Time.
Again,  for  those unfortunates of you who don't know: this is another  spell
transformed from first to 2nd edition; it was formerly an illusionist  spell,
but I edited the material components a little.

This  spell removes fatigue from the affected creature and protects  it  from
tiring  further for the spell duration. However, once the spell expires,  the
recipient must rest for the amount of time spent in strenuous activity (i.e.,
running,  melee  combat)  while  under the  spell.  No  damage  sustained  is
restored, including broken or sprained limbs, i.e., you still can't run on  a
sprained   ankle.  The  spell  is  also  ineffective  against  magically   or
psionically caused fatigue (such as ray of enfeeblement), or against  subdual
damage. The material component of this spell is a miniature stone wheel.

When  this spell is cast all odours disappear in the area of effect:  no  new
odours  will enter or leave the protected sphere. This effect lasts  for  the
full  duration  of the spell   2 rounds per level of the priest  casting  the
spell. The area of effect must be centred around an object or a creature  and
so  it will move if its centre turns out to be mobile. Unwilling creatures or
objects  worn by unwilling creatures receive a saving throw versus  spell  in
order  to  prevent the spell from taking effect (the objects  have  the  same
saving  throw as the creature that is carrying them). The material  component
is a piece of garlic that disappears when the spell is cast.
The  spell provides excellent protection against odour-based attacks, be they
magical  like  stinking cloud or natural like the smell troglodytes  produce.
Dispel  scent can also be used to avoid being noticed by animals or  monsters
that rely heavily on their noses.

When  this  spell  is  cast, a double layer of magical energy  surrounds  the
caster  at  approximately 1 foot from the caster's body.  This  field's  only
function is to stop any two dispel magic spells cast at the wizard.
This  spell  was  created by a wizard for his human (actually  a  polymorphed
dragon)  apprentice, who believes it is actually a protection from  polymorph
other. The objective is that enemy mages can't turn him into a dragon and use
him against his allies.

When  cast,  this spell automatically dispels any magical silence within  its
area  of  effect. Furthermore, no silence spell will have effect  within  the
area of effect for the duration of the spell.
The casting of this spell requires a small silver bell, chime, or gong, which
must be struck twice, at the end of the casting. The device must be worth  at
least 50 gp, and is consumed in the casting.

effect  is  within thirty feet of the wizard. The base chance for success  is
50%  modified upward or downward by 5% per level the wizard is above or below

This  spell  allows the caster to replace his counterpart  in  adjacent  time
stream.  When  the  spell  is  cast, the time  spirit  forcibly  removes  his
existence from one time stream and places it in the one immediately  adjacent
to  it.  The caster's counterpart is eradicated in that reality at  the  same
time, the caster assuming his place.
This  spell  is  generally only used by a time spirit in  the  most  dire  of
straits,  due to the irrevocable violence it does to the caster's counterpart
and  because the caster is also drained of all spells higher than first level
and  is  left weak ( 2 to-hit and damage, and  3 to Constitution checks)  for
1d10  days following. Lawful aligned time spirits hardly ever use this spell,
since  it can be claimed with some justification that it is a form of  murder
(what  other term can be applied to act of snuffing out the life  of  another
human  being, even if that human is a version of you?). Note that the use  of
this spell has a 25% chance of attracting the attention of time guardians.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for
more information on this class.

When  cast  on  a subject, this spell causes the subject to appear  to  be  2
metres  to the left or right (50% chance of each at time of casting)  of  his

apparent  position  as if thhad actually hit him. If the subject  appears  to

The casting of this spell evokes a hole, 12-inch in diameter, in the wizard's
hand.  The  hole may be placed on any surface; anything subsequently  dropped
into  it  (an  item must be smaller than the hole's diameter; since  this  is
neither an extra-dimensional space nor a sphere of annihilation, items larger
than  that are not "sucked" into it) vanishes and is teleported to the bottom
of  the nearest sewage system (moat, sewer, large body of water, etc.). It is
especially  effective for disposing of garbage, kitchen waste,  body  wastes,
etc.,  and  may  be  used  in the garderobe of an area  otherwise  devoid  of
plumbing.  Magical and living items (of at least animal Intelligence;  normal
insects and non-sentient plant life are therefore not considered "living" for
this  purpose) receive a saving throw to resist the teleportation (there  was
no  plumbing in Kestrel's tower, hence this spell saves on traipsing  up  and
down all those stairs with a chamberpot).

The  target  of  this  spell must make a saving throw versus  magic.  Success
indicates  that the spell has no effect; failure means that all  magical  and
non-magical  items worn by the creature, excluding items held in  hands,  are
stripped  from  the creature and strewn in a 3-foot radius.  Items  magically
blink  from  the creature to the ground and will not be harmed  by  the  fall
unless the creature is flying more than 3 feet from the ground.
This  spell was researched by Insley Hofton. Insley has a kinky streak.  This
was  invented  partly as an amusement, and partly to strip  all  those  nasty
magic  items  from  the  bad guys. It's best combined  with  unseen  servant,
telekinesis,  or  light-fingered friends which can pick  up  the  items  thus
removed.

This spell makes the victim incapable of casting spells for 2d4 rounds. There
is a saving throw versus death magic to avoid this. This spell actually makes
spellcasting impossible by disrupting the magical energy of memorised spells.
Thus,  the  victim could still cast a spell from a scroll, and innate  spell-
like abilities are not affected.

This  is  an improved version of the 3rd-level disrupt spellcaster. The  only
change  is  the increased duration. It makes the victim incapable of  casting
spells for the duration, one day per level of the wizard. This spell actually
makes  spellcasting impossible by disrupting the magical energy of  memorised
spells.  Thus, the victim could still cast a spell from a scroll, and  innate
spell-like  abilities are not affected. There is a saving throw versus  death
magic  to  avoid this. The only way to remove this spell is with a successful
dispel magic.

This  spell causes all those in the area of effect to be filled with contempt
and  hatred for all others in that area. Those that save versus spell are not
filled  with  these emotions, but they might still be the target  of  hatred.
There  is a 75% chance that creatures affected by this spell will immediately
attack  their  new enemy. Their targets will either be those  most  different
from  them (another race, another class, from another country or clan, etc.),
or  chosen  at  random. These attacks will continue until  all  the  affected
creatures are dead (or one is the only survivor), or the spell duration ends.
Leaving  the  initial area of effect does not end the spell. If there  is  no
initial  attack, there will be insults and other slights. This  could  easily
degenerate  into  fighting, at the discretion of the DM, depending  on  other
events  and  the  nature of those affected. For creatures that  are  normally
hostile  to  each other, the chance of immediate attack rises to 90%.  Lawful
creatures  save at +1 versus this spell, as do good creatures.  Chaotic  ones
save at -1. These bonuses and penalties are cumulative. If those affected  by
this  spell are directly attacked by another enemy (one that was not  in  the
initial area of the spell), there is a 50% chance that they will turn on this
new attacker, afterwards resuming their old attack.

This  spell  is specifically designed toward distracting wizards before  they
can  unleash  their magic. The victim must save versus spell at  -5  or  lose
spell  concentration. Note that this spell has absolutely no  effect  against
non-wizards. All it does is interrupt the flow of magical information between
the  wizard's  conscious and subconscious. The material  component  for  this
spell is a pair of scissors, which is consumed in the casting.

By  means  of this spell, the wizard may demolish a dwelling as if  it  where
done  by an expert demolition team. Unless the dwelling is magical, the spell
will  totally  destroy the building. The nice thing about this spell  however
is,  that  when the spell is finished and the dust clears, all that  will  be
left (nicely stacked and reusable) are the following: 75% of the wood, 50% of
all stone, 10% of any metal and 10% of any other odd structural material.

The material component is a perfectly smooth disc of black onyx which must be
smashed during spell casting.

With  the casting of this spell, the wielder calls being a sphere of negative
magic  energy. This sphere is then hurled at one creature with spell  casting
abilities.  Unless a saving throw at -6 is made, the creature is affected  by
this spell. If the creature hit is a wizard, the wizard forgets the spells he
had  memorised  for the day, and cannot seem to memorise  any  more  for  the
remainder of the day. If the creature hit is a priest, they seem to have lost
contact  with  their  deity for the remainder of the  day,  and  cannot  cast
prayers.  The effects of this spell can only be cancelled by a limited  wish,
wish,  or  divine  intervention; dispel magic is not  effective  against  the
effects of this spell.
The wizard has a 10% chance of being affected by this spell as well, since he
must hold the sphere before it is launched.

The  material  component  for this spell is a one  foot  long,  one  inch  in
diameter rod of pure obsidian.

This spell is a more powerful version of the 7th-level Ditan's minor nullify.
This  spell stops the wizard or priest from using their abilities for a week,
as  well as temporarily disabling any carried magic items to function.  Items
get a saving throw versus crushing blow, while artifacts are not affected  at
all. The wizard has a 30% chance of being affected, but if he is affected, he
is affected as by minor nullify.

The  material components for this spell are a 1000 gp worth ball of  obsidian
and  a  1000 gp diamond, that are both consumed in the casting. The  victim's
saving throw is at -8.

This  spell  is  a  more powerful version of the 7th-level  Ditan's  portable
quarters, with the following exceptions.
The  spell only enchants one doorknob, and it opens up onto a two story home,
with  5  bedrooms, two bathrooms, 5 miscellaneous rooms, and a  kitchen.  The
owner  may  allow  up to 16 beings in, as well as himself. In  addition,  the
character  may  contact the outside world via a call portal that  allows  the
characters inside to view the immediate area where they entered.
The  additional  material  component is a ring of spell  storing  with  three
enlarge spells held within, that is consumed in casting the spell.

When  this spell is cast the wizard enchants one doorknob-shaped gem (of 1000
gp  value  or  more)  per five levels of the wizard's  experience.  Once  the
doorknob is enchanted it will remain so for one day for every nine levels  of
the  wizard, and a number will appear on the doorknob informing the owner  on
how many days it will function (this number changes as days pass).
From this moment on, until the end of the duration of the spell, the owner of
the  doorknob may use it to enter a magical room. The owner simply holds  the
knob as if it where attached to a door, pushes, and an outline of a door will
appear  and  the door will open into a 30x30x30 feet room. The room  that  it
opens onto depends on the person using the doorknob (examples: a male fighter
turns   the  knob  and  finds  a  comfortable  room,  with  weapon   cleaning
apparatuses, like a sharpening stone and weapon oil; and weapon stands, while
a  priestess opens it and finds a plush, comfortable room, with an  altar  to
her  deity and a place to clean up. All rooms include a bathroom and  washing
area).  The rooms will never have any magic items in them when created,  just
normal items.
The  owner  may have up to two other people in the room at a time.  Once  the
door  is  closed the only way to open it again is with the doorknob,  and  it
will always open at the very spot at which the character entered. Time passes
normally  while inside these rooms. The owner may leave things in  this  room
and  they will be safe as long as the spell is in effect, but if the material
is  still in the room at the time of the spell's end, the materials are  gone
forever.  Any  person  in the room at the end of the  spell's  duration  will
reappear where the door was last opened or closed.
There  is no way anyone can contact or reach someone in a room once the  door
is closed, since the outline disappears. This doorknob will only work for the
owner: if it is given away, taken, or stolen, it will not work.

The  material  component  for this spell is the  appropriate  number  of  gem
doorknobs, a pint of dragonblood, and a bit of unicorn horn.

When  this spell is cast the wizard calls into being two spheres of  negative
energy, one from the realm of negative magic energy, and one from the  quasi-
negative material plane. The spheres are then hurled at the victim,  and  the
character  gets a saving throw at -6, to avoid being affected.  If  affected,
the  character loses all the abilities of his class or classes.  Spells  will
not  work, specialisation is lost, and skills are forgotten. The only way  to
dispel  this effect is through a wish or divine intervention. A limited  wish
will temporarily (1d20 turns) restore abilities.

The  material component for this spell is a 1-foot cube of obsidian, the  eye
of a black dragon, and a trapped soul of a demon of at least 16 HD. All spell
components are consumed in the casting. There is a 50% chance of the soul  of
the  demon being released, and trying to take over the wizard. If taken over,
the wizard is drained of all spell abilities for 1d4 years.

This  spell will resolidify anything effected by crystalbrittle or  a  breath
weapon.   It   will  not  mend  items  that  have  been  broken   since   the
crystalbrittle,  though  (eg.: Galgor's sword was  crystalbrittled,  then  he
dropped  it and it shattered, even though he found every piece and placed  it
back  together,  when this spell is cast all he will have is many  pieces  of
metal).  If the item was magical when crystalbrittle took effect, then  there
is  only  a 25% chance that when it is resolidified it will still be magical.
The material component for this spell is 1 pint of dragon blood.

This  spell forces the recipient to sink to the bottom of a body of water  at
the  rate of 20 yards per round unless they make a saving throw versus spell.
No amount of swimming or struggling will stop the victims descent. However, a
rope or other secured object that can hold the weight of the victim will stop
the sinking.
The  spell  recipient will sink for a number of rounds equal to the  caster's
spell  level. If they touchdown at the bottom of the water before  the  spell
duration  expires, they will simply be unable to leave the ground  until  the
spell wears off. When this spell is cast in the elemental plane of water, the
victim will sink in whatever direction their feet were facing at the time  of
casting.  This spell will also affect those that are swimming on the  surface
of a body of water.
The  reverse of this spell, surface, will force the recipient to float to the
surface of the water for the duration of the spell.

The material component of this spell is a small ball of lead.

The  priest begins this spell by describing in full the quest he is on.  This
includes  naming the desired conclusion to the quest and imploring his  deity
to  take notice of the urgent nature of the mission. When this description is
completed, if the priest is successful in persuading his deity, the  priest's
body  is  surrounded by a majestic glow which grows in brilliance  until  the
priest  radiates  the same illumination as the midday sun. This  illumination
lasts  for  1  round  during which the priest's body undergoes  a  miraculous
transformation. After the light fades, the priest emerges with grey hair  and
a  look of awe on his face. The awe fades in 1 round and the priest's mood is
serene.  Thereafter all of the priest's ability scores are raised to 19,  and
the  appropriate bonuses as described in the Player's Handbook  are  applied.
Note that the priest does not gain any divine abilities with this spell.
Use  of  this  spell  draws the attention of the deity, and  the  spell  only
succeeds  if the deity is pleased with the usage (i.e., the priest  is  on  a
quest  of overwhelming danger and is seeking vengeance for a terrible  wrong,
the  priest is fighting in the name of his God against a special enemy of the
deity,  etc.). If the deity is very pleased with the priest, the bonuses  may
be applied to the priest for the entire length of the quest the priest is on.
When  the  quest ends, the priest falls to his knees, announces to his  deity
that the quest is over, and falls comatose for 1d4 turns.
The material components of this spell are a vial of holy water (which must be
swallowed during the casting) and the priest's holy symbol.

Casting of this spell involves taking a clear vessel of water and releasing a
drop of ink into it. The percentage of the water not darkened by the diffused
ink  indicates  that person's purity score. Although not absolutely  certain,
any  score  under  50%  probably indicates loss of virginity,  and  with  the
exception of the rarest of heroes and deities, the score will be between  25%
(casual  interaction with others) and 90% (extreme debauchery). More specific
information may be revealed at the DM's discretion.

     This spell reveals the hetero- or homosexuality of a given creature of a
species with two genders. The material component is a clear, colourless  gem,
which is not consumed in the casting, and changes colour as follows:

Colour      Sexual Orientation
-------------------------------------------------
red         totally heterosexual
orange      strongly heterosexual
yellow      bisexual leaning towards heterosexual
green       50-50 bisexual
blue        bisexual leaning towards homosexual
violet      strongly homosexual
ultraviolet totally homosexual

Sage's note: this is simply the Kinsey scale of sexuality.

      In  normal daylight, of course, ultraviolet will not show clearly,  and
will  appear  to  anyone without infravision as lavender. The creature  being
scried  must  be  alive  and  visible to the  caster.  The  method  of  sight
(infravision,  scrying, clairvo etc.) does not matter. Portraits,  illusions,
or  statues, however, will not suffice. The gem will remain white, indicating
spell  failure,  if the creature is asexual, its attractions  are  completely
unrelated to gender, or is magically protected, as by the reverse spell, hide
sexual orientation, which conceals sexual orientation from magical or psionic
detection for 24 hours.

Sage's note: although psionics are still a young discipline in the Realms, it
has  been  demonstrated  that the psionic science of aura  sight  can  reveal
sexual orientation, especially when the subject has expended a great deal  of
psychic energy on sex or sexuality.

The  priest begins this spell by describing in full the quest he is on.  This
includes naming the desired conclusion to the quest, and imploring his  deity
to  take notice of the urgent nature of the mission. When this description is
completed,  if the priest is successful is persuading his deity, clouds  form
over  the  priest  and the priest's body is struck by a tremendous  lightning
bolt.  The  lightning flashes for one full round, during which  the  priest's
body  undergoes a glorious transformation. After the flashing  subsides,  the
priest emerges as a fully empowered avatar of his deity.
Use  of  this  spell  draws the attention of the deity, and  the  spell  only
succeeds  if the deity is pleased with the usage (i.e., the priest is  on  an
urgent  quest in the service of the deity). When the priest casts this spell,
he  gives over his will completely to that of his deity. The priest can,  for
the  most  part, make his own decisions. However, if the priest  ever  strays
from  the  alignment of the deity or ever acts out of character for a  divine
being,  the  priest is instantly and irrevocably struck dead, and  the  deity
assumes  control of the avatar. The deity can, of course, at  any  time  take
over the body of the priest or avatar.
At the end of the one hour period, the deity can decide to keep the priest in
the  form of the avatar for another hour, or can choose to end the spell. The
deity  can  even choose to keep the priest as the avatar for  life.  In  this
case,  the  deity  assumes control of the avatar and  the  character  of  the
casting priest is irrevocably gone.
If  the deity chooses to release the priest, the avatar's body will glow with
a  pure  white radiance and vanish. The priest will then be teleported  to  a
location  of  the  deity's  choice, and will fall  comatose  for  1d4  turns.
Thereafter, the priest will be unable to cast spells until the next day,  and
will  be under the influence of a quest spell placed upon the priest  by  the
deity. The quest is the price of calling on the deity for direct aid.
The  material component of this spell is a sacrifice appropriate to the deity
as determined by the DM.

This  spell  summons  a  number of dogs to fight for  the  wizard.  The  dogs
summoned will only fight, they cannot be used for other tasks. The wizard can

Wizard's Level    Summoned Dogs
----------------------------------------------
1-4               wild dogs (1 HD)
5-7               war dogs (2 HD)
8+                blink (4 HD) or death (2 HD)

      The  wizard can always chose the dogs from a lower level. Only one type
of  dog can be summoned, and any remainders are dropped. A maximum of 10 dogs
can be summoned.

This spell is similar to the 2nd-level priest spell specialisation except for
two  differences. The first is that it gives the priest double specialisation
in  the  god's  preferred weapon, if he has one, or the  priest's  weapon  of
choice  if not. The second difference is that this spell can be used to  give
specialisation  to  another  person  in  any  chosen  weapon.  The   material
components and somatic gestures are the same as for specialisation.

This  spell's  material  components are phosphorus  and  two  wires,  twisted

time. This may not be a very good spell, but it sure is neat looking.

* Failure results in a loss of 10 points of Constitution, recovered at a rate

unless  a system shock roll is made, in which case his Constitution  is  only
lowered to 1.

for  the  duration of the spell, doing his hit points in damage.  During  the
spell's duration and an equal number of rounds afterwards, the wizard  cannot

This  spell causes the victim to have dreams exactly as the wizard lays  them
out.  Nightmares, messages, fantasies are all possible actions in the dreams.
These dreams will seem real. If the person finds out about the source of  the
dreams  it  is  likely that he will not take kindly to them.  The  chance  of
success is 5% per level of the wizard minus 10% per level of victim (less  5%
per  degree of extremeness of the dreams as determined by the DM). This spell
can  deprive  the  victim of a good night's sleep with  the  same  chance  of
success, thus preventing him from regaining spells overnight. The victim must
have  been touched at some time by the wizard to use this spell. If the spell
is  negated,  the wizard cannot try to control the dreams of the same  victim
again  until he has gained a level. The material component for this spell  is
an ornamental cushion, arduously decorated, of at least 20 gp value.

With this power a dreamer psionicist can, in Dreamland,  construct
any  creature with which he/she is familiar.  This will enable the
dreamer  to  empower  the  construct with  all  abilities  of  the
creature  including magical, psionicaly, etc.   The  dreamer  then
becomes  the brain of the construct using the construct's  senses,
abilities,  etc.   The dreamer's dream form becomes  inert  during
this  period,  and  may be as far away from the construct  as  the
dreamer desires.  Further, the construct has the maximum number of
hit  points  possible for a creature of this type, and  draws  all
PSPs  from  the  dreamer's PSP total.  The  dreamer  may  use  all
psionicist  powers he/she has normally available  in  addition  to
whatever the construct has available.  If the construct is  slain,
the  dreamer is  immediately forced back to his/her own form,  and
must  make a system shock  roll.  If the roll is successful,  then
the dreamer regains consciousness in their proper form with no ill
effects,  if  failed, the dreamer passes out for  3d6 rounds,  and
suffers 2d6 hit points of damage.
      This  is  a difficult power to use because of the  high  PSP
cost.   The initial cost is 10 PSPs per 1000 XP the creature being
imitated  is  worth. So for instance, a creature worth  16,000  XP
requires an initial cost of 160 PSPs to make a construct of.   The
maintenance  cost is one tenth the initial cost  per  round.   The
calculation of the initial cost can be further refined  by  making
it  to  be  1  PSP  per  100  XP.   Round  fractions  up  in  this
calculation.

Power Score:  The construct's hit points are doubled.

20:   The  construct  is seriously flawed  in  some  way,  at  the
discretion of the DM, not to be told to the dreamer.  For example,
the  construct  might  have only half the  normal  number  of  hit
points, it might not have some critical ability available, etc.

This  power  alters  the dreamer's material  world  form  so  that
resembles  the  Dreamland  form  in  shape  and  statistics.   The
transformation takes an actual time of 30 seconds (5 in  a  combat
situation)  but  the  dreamer must spend the  rest  of  the  round
recovering  from  the shock.  After that, the dreamer's  Dreamland
form  (including  all  Dreamland items and  the  Dreamland  weapon
proficiencies)  is fully usable.  Although useful,  this  is  also
rather dangerous.  If the dreamer rolls a natural 5 or less,  they
fall  into  a  coma for a number of days equal  to  25  minus  the
dreamer's  constitution.  Once a dreamer ceases to expend  PSP  to
maintain  this  power, the dreamer's form slowly changes  back  (2
rounds  for transformation) and the dreamer falls asleep  for  1/2
the time that he/she was in their altered form.

Power Score:  The crossover lasts 3 hours free.

20:  The dreamer must make another power check.  If it fails or is
below  5, then the character dies, otherwise, he/she falls into  a
coma  equal  to  1/2 the time specified above for  a  power  score
failure.

This  power  allows  a dreamer to enter the dream  of  a  sleeping
person.   Once  inside the dream, the dreamer  can  any  of  their
powers  directly  on the individual.  The dreamer  may  even  draw
others into the target's dream.  As well, the dreamer may elect to
kill  the  individual  in their dream.   Doing  so  in  a  Natural
Dreamland is very hazardous.  Since the Natural Dreamland is  only
in  the mind of the individual (and the dreamer and any other  are
effectively inside it) killing the person is almost always  fatal.
Any  person left in the mind of a person who has just been killed,
must  make  a  saving  throw  vs. death  magic  or  die  with  the
individual.   The  dreamer  must make a  Wisdom  check  at  a  -10
penalty.  If succeeded, the dreamer is able to jump back to  their
own body in time.

Power  Score:  The dreamer may kill the target without any  chance
of death

20:  The dreamer must save vs. death magic or die

      This  allows the dreamer to create any non-magical, personal
item, weapon, suit of armor, etc.  This item lasts as long as  the
dreamer  staysin Dreamland.  The item will behave  as  the  normal
item  would  (a  weapon will cause damage, armor  will  protect  a
person and a rope will, well..um, do rope things!)

Power  Score:   The item is magical and the DM will determine  its
powers,  but  it  will  only bring 1/10th of its  full  experience
value.   The  maximum experience possible (before devaluation)  is
1,000XP.

20:  This item is extremely unstable and will explode causing 2d10
hp damage when moved quickly (most likely when picked up)

      This  allows a dreamer to form a mental link between himself
and  another individual by linking their minds in Dreamland.  This
power  is similar to, and can replace, the psionic powers mindlink
and  contact, but some differences are there.  The main difference
is  that the link is two way, although with most people that  does
not  mean  much.   When using this power on a dreamer,  the  other
dreamer must make a power score for the Dream Link power.   If  it
succeeds and is above 5, then the victim dreamer wakes up and  can
now  use their powers.  A normal psionicist can also wake up,  but
they  must make their power score, but at a -5 penalty (unless  it
fails naturally, in which case it has no penalty)

Power Score:  The link is one way, and in favor of the dreamer.

20:   The  link  is one way, in the favor of the victim,  and  the
victim  (if  a psionicist) wakes up while the dreamer is  mentally
stunned  for 1d6+5 rounds (in which time the link is kept  up  for
free)

This  power allows the dreamer to pull a sleeping person into  the
mode of Dreamland that the dreamer is currently in, be it natural,
true,  or travel.  This does not actually give the dreamer  access
to  the person's dreams, but it does have a chance (75%) of giving
the  victim a very severe nightmare with all the negative  affects
associated with one.  If the sleeper is already having a Dreamland
dream,  then it will automatically be a nightmare.  If the  victim
does  not having a nightmare, then they would not have a dream  at
all  that night.  This power is essential to dreamer so that  they
may  have access to their victims (which must be in Dreamland  for
any of their powers, save Dream Crossover and Waking Dream)

Power  Score:   The  victim suffers Dreamland nightmares  for  two
nights after the initial night of severe nightmares.

20:  The dreamer suffers nightmares that night.

This power is normally used by somniomancers (master in a psionics
concerned with the sleeping mind).
      Before using this devotion, the psionicist must falls into a
deep sleep or sleep trance state during which she dreams of places
and events around her.  Her vision is then attuned to the location
desired. In the dream, she can both see and hear and can will  his
vision  to  change  so that she can view the surrounding  area  as
well.  She  cannot  see  into an area that  is  protected  against
teleport  or  similar powers or spells, however.  Nor  can  sounds
coming from such an area be heard.
     When using this devotion the psionicist astral body leave her
physical  body and is able to walk, look around, pass  walls,  ...
The distance that a psionicist can move from her body is equal  to
100  yards  per  level  of  the psionicist.  The  astral  body  is
invisible  by  normal means but is vulnerable to any attacks  that
can  reach astral or ethereal creatures. While in astral form  the
psionicist  is  treated as an ethereal traveler, cannot  influence
the normal word and can only use psionics on herself.
      The  astral  body is attached to the physical  body  by  the
silver  cord. The silvery cord is nearly indestructible,  however.
Usually  it  can be severed only by the psychic wind at  its  most
powerful, or by the silver swords of the githyanki.
      At  the end, the dream vision ends, and she awakens. If  the
psionicist's  body is disturbed before the dream sight  ends,  the
power ends and the psionicist is immediately awakened.

Power Score:  The astral body of the psionicist is able to see  in
darkness (normal or magical).

20:   The  psionicist has a terrible nightmare is unable to  sleep
for 8 hours.

      This power allows the dreamer to watch in on anothers dream.
They  cannot participate or otherwise communicate, but the sleeper
"feels"  that  they are being watched.  Due to this  for  every  2
turns  the dreamer is watching, the dream moves down one  type  on
the  dream  scale (good becomes average, average ceases  to  be  a
dream,  no dream soon turns into a bad one, and so on)   As  well,
using  this  power in conjunction with Control Dream, the  dreamer
gains  a +2 bonus when attempting to use the Control Dream  power,
but not if that +2 will take it over the power score.

Power Score:  The character can send mental messages to the person
watched.   This  quadruples the speed of the decay  of  the  dream
after a message is sent, even if the message is reassuring.

20:   The  dreamer is actually watching his worst  nightmare  from
when  he/she was a child.  This shakes up the dreamer as  per  the
rules for extreme nightmares.

With  this power a dreamer psionicist can, in Dreamland, construct
a  dream  landscape of any type they desire.  It may  be  mundane,
fantastic,   any  type of terrain, etc.  This in conjunction  with
Dream  Creature allows  the psionicist to gain godlike  status  in
Dreamland.   Further,  a  psionicist   who  uses  this  power   in
conjunction with Dream Creature may construct and  use a  creature
without concern for the consequences of the creature being killed,
further  the  psionicist may construct up to 1 + 1d2 creatures  of
the same type without extra cost.

Power Score:  The maintenance cost is halved.

20:   The dreamscape is distorted badly, and anyone in it may save
vs.  spto escape it.

A  character using dreamfield can project thought waves  into  the
minds  of  sleeping  people.  This allows  a  psionicist  to  take
control  of dreams, and shape them in any manner they want.   Even
other  psionicists may have their dreams invaded by  this  without
having  first  been  defeated in psionic  combat.   The  attacking
psionicist  may  not  kill  someone with  this,  or  cause  direct
physical  harm,  but if he/she chooses to create  a  nightmare  in
which  in the victim is slain, then the victim must roll save  vs.
spell at a -2 penalty without the benefit of WIS bonuses.  If  the
save fails, then the victim suffers fatigue, and will for 24 hours
afterwards take a -2 penalty to all die rolls.
      A  psionicist can project this power to a centre point up to
40 yards distant from him/herself, with an area of effect of a 20'
radius.  If a character is struck during the time they are trapped
in  a dreamfield, then they will immediately awaken and break  the
effect of the dreamfield, if the awakening occurred before the end
of the dream.  Also, the attacking psionicist may attempt this but
once  per night on a particular victim.  It takes 2+d2 rounds  for
the attacking psionicist to complete the effect.
      Special  Note: If the Dreamland rules are used, a  character
who is in Dreamland (naturally or otherwise) is unaffected by this
power  and  cannot even be reached.  If the psionicist tries  this
power  on  a dreamer psionicist, the dreamer's conscious  mind  is
immediately awoken and alerted to the attempt.  At this time,  the
psionicist  is most vulnerable because the dreamer  knows  of  the
attempt  and  can do something to the psionicist  while  they  are
still recovering from their failed attempt.

Power  Score:  Victims must save at a -4 penalty, and further,  if
they  fail, they will suffer a -3 penalty to all die rolls for  24
hours afterwards.

20:   The  dreamfield backfires, and the psionicist falls  into  a
trance  where  he/she  suffers  all  the  effects  of  a  horrific
nightmare  with  the  resulting penalties to die  rolls,  no  save
allowed.   The  psionicist  emerges  from  the  trance  when   the
nightmare is over.

This  spell  creates a 5-foot long shimmering blue shaft of  force  from  the
wizard's  outstretched hands. He must physically wield the weapon in  combat,
thus  spells with somatic components cannot be cast while the summoned  blade
exists.  The  "sword", however, has no true material existence and  does  not
conduct shock back to its wielder, thus its overall speed factor is 1. It  is
neither  an edged nor blunt weapon and affects creatures normally  immune  to
either.
The  blade  strikes once per round with a +5 to-hit bonus,  inflicting  2d6+5
damage  points per successful hit. It lasts 1 round per level of  the  wizard
and is subject to disintegrate and dispel magic. The material component is  a
500 gp crystal sword which requires 2 weeks to construct.

When  this  spell is cast, the wizard sets up a brilliant array of pale  blue
dancing rays which forms a decagon between both hands. The spell draws  power
directly  from  the  psychic winds of the astral  and  ethereal  plane.  Once
complete,  it may fire a 1-foot wide beam of pure magical force every  round,
and  this ray unerringly strikes any single creature or object within 10 feet
per  level (invisible targets require a to-hit roll versus AC 6, modified  by
Dexterity, etc.) and inflicts 1d4+1 damage points per level of the wizard, up
to  12d4+12  maximum. A successful saving throw versus spell  halves  damage.
These beams may be unleashed from the decagon:
          Eldritch beam: magic missile energy; affects only animate targets.
          Impaling force ray: inflicts piercing or impaling damage.
          Planar force beam: inflicts edged or slicing damage.
          Spherical force bolt: inflicts blunt or crushing damage.
           Vibration  or  shock wave: an ultrasonic bolt which  affects  only
crystal, glass, stone, and other objects vulnerable to vibration damage.
           Wind  blast:  as the 3rd-level wizard spell, gust of wind  (q.v.),
against a single target.
The  wizard  must  concentrate to maintain the  eldritch  decagon,  thus  any
successful attack against him negates the spell. The material component is  a
small  crystal in the shape of a 10-sided die set inside an iron ring, and  a
loadstone.

This  spell  protects the recipient from any magic-energy based attack.  Each
individual  manifestation (magic missile, eldritch sphere, etc.) directed  at
the  recipient  is  absorbed by the shield, whether or not they  successfully
hit. The eldritch shield can withstand up to 1d4 attacks + 1 attack per three
levels.
Note that regular attacks also reduce an eldritch shield without any penalty,
and  the shield may only absorb spells which the wizard has sufficient levels
to  cast  (for example, a 9 HD eldritch shield can protect from  1d4+4  magic
missiles  or  similar spells, while a griffon would take three off  from  the
shield  and still inflict normal damage). The material component is  sapphire
and diamond dust which is sprinkled upon the creature to be protected.

This  potent  spell  launches a mentally guided 1-foot diameter  globe  which
travels up to 60 feet per 6 seconds and turns up to 90  per round. The sphere
strikes as a monster of the wizard's Hit Dice, but even on a missed roll, the
missile  may  return the following round as long as the wizard  concentrates.
Once it hits, the globe disperses and inflicts 2d6 points of base damage +  2
points of damage per level of the wizard to the first creature touched, up to
2d6+20 maximum potential.
The sphere harmlessly vanishes if the wizard's concentration is broken or the
globe exceeds maximum range. Despite its limited area of effect, the eldritch
sphere's  true  advantage is its damage potential and ability to  pursue  and
possibly corner single foes.

This  spell  actually has two variations. The first produces a  special  dart
which  the wizard hurls toward its target. The dart has a +3 to-hit bonus  at
10  feet  or  less, +2 at 20 feet, and +1 at 30 feet. A successful  hit  does
1d4+2 points of damage + 1 HP per wizard's level. The second version enchants
an  ordinary  arrow or quarrel, making it magical for hitting  purposes,  and
delivering double normal damage + 1 HP per wizard's level.
Both  versions  also have a residual blast radius, inflicting 2d4  points  of
damage, or 1d4 on a saving throw versus death magic. Any item struck directly
by  an explosive missile must save versus crushing blow to avoid damage.  The
material  components  are sulphur, diamond dust, and the appropriate  missile
being  enchanted.  The  first version requires a 10 gp  silver  dart  as  its
missile.  The explosive missile must be used within three rounds of creation,
otherwise it detonates and does damage to those immediately around it.

inflicting 2d6 base damage + 3 points per level of the wizard, up to a 2d6+30

does 32-42 damage points).

Also  known  as Dreamoore's bolts of seeking, this spell creates a powerfully
enchanted  bolt  which has base 1d12 damage plus 3 points per  level  of  its
wizard,  up to 1d12+36 maximum (eg., a 12th-level missile tempest does  37-48
HP  damage). This bolt, however, can split into two or more missiles striking
single  or  multiple  targets (with a minimum of  one  point  of  damage  per
missile). Once the wizard unleashes the bolt, he need but point and close his
fist. The missile then flashes outward, dividing into smaller missiles if  so
directed,  and  unerringly hits all visible targets in a 90  arc  before  the
wizard.  The material component for this spell is a 500 gp diamond  which  is
hurled into the air as spell casting is completed.

The  spellblade is a 1-foot up to 5-foot variable diameter rotating  circular
blade of force which the wizard mentally commands, and he must concentrate to
maintain  it  (thus  any  successful  attack  against  the  wizard  ends  the
spellblade).
There  are actually two variants for the spell, and the type must be selected
at  the  start  of  casting. The first strikes with a +1 to +5  to-hit  bonus
(corresponding  to  the blade's diameter) and attacks everything  within  the
designated area of effect. It inflicts 1d10 base damage + 1 damage point  per
wizard's level. The second version directly attacks walls of force, having  a
1%  cumulative chance per damage point inflicted of bringing down a  barrier.
It has no effect upon other creatures.

The  viper  lance launches a 2-foot long solid metal shaft at extremely  high
velocity.  This  bolt  always  travels in a  straight  line  trajectory,  its
blinding  speed  making  it near-invisible. Any creature  struck  immediately
suffers  base  1d10+2  HP of damage, up to 1d10+30 maximum.  The  wizard  may
launch one bolt per six experience levels, though only one bolt may be  fired
per  round. The material component is a solid steel shaft engraved  with  the
wizard's  personal  rune,  with  a  mithril  or  adamantine  tip,  and   zinc
stabilising fins. Each bolt requires two weeks and 250 gp construction cost.

The  war disk is a small, hand-hurled missile which the wizard throws  toward

version  he is casting prior to the throw. The first type hits only once  for
1d4 points of damage + 1 HP per level of the wizard. The second may be thrown
once   per  round  for  1d4+1  points  of  damage  per  successful  hit   and
automatically returns at the end of the round. Its duration is one round  per

The  warding shield is a unique magical screen which encompasses one creature
and  protects  it  from harm. The shield remains completely  invisible  until
struck by any attack, including weapons and spells which cause direct damage.
Then  it  then  flares pale blue, absorbing part or all of  the  attack  (any
damage  which  is  not  absorbed goes directly to  the  character  using  the
shield).
The warding shield may absorb up to base 1d4 HP of damage + 2 HP per level of
the  wizard. If a magic resistant creature attacks the spell's host, then its
resistance  is checked first. Success indicates that the shield  is  bypassed
during  that attack, and damage goes directly to the person being  protected.
However,  the  shield  remains intact until it loses  all  hit  points,  gets
dispelled,  or  until all hit points elapse, at a rate of 1 HD  per  turn.  A
person may have only one warding shield at a time.

The  material component is 50 gp worth of diamond dust which is  thrown  into
the air as the spell is cast.

When  the  psionicist  employs  this  science,  he  projects   his
consciousness  into  the  dreams of  his  sleeping  victim.   Upon
arrival  into  the dream the victim is allowed a wisdom  check  to
notice  the anomaly.  If it succeeds he understands the nature  of
the attacker, and may choose to end the dream.
      When  the psionicist enters the dream, he takes the form  of
the  victim's  worst fear.  He then chases the  victim  until  the
dream ends, or the victim wakes.  Upon waking the victim remembers
nothing about the dream, only a dark sense of foreboding and fear.
He  will  also have lost one point of Constitution.  The point  of
CON   can   only   be  recovered  through  the  following   means:
restoration,  heal, Psychic Surgery, or a Cell Adjustment  costing
60  points.  Each of these restores one point per application.   A
limited  wish will restore 3 points, and a wish will  restore  the
victim fully.
      The  Dreamstalker can be used night after  night  until  the
victim is dead (CON reaches zero).  The victim can only be revived
by  a  heal,  restoration, and resurrection,  in  that  order,  or
through a wish.
      If the sleeper contacted through this power happens to be  a
dreamer psionicist, then the person using this power is in  for  a
rude  awakening.  The dreamer's conscious mind immediately awakens
and  they have several options.  They can escape the power and  go
into  Dreamland and proceed to use their own powers on the  person
using  Dreamstalker.  They may use their non-dreamer powers as  if
they  too  had a contact on the person using the power, and  thus,
start  a psionic combat.  They may break contact at a cost  of  10
PSP  with  no  chance  of  failure.  This would  not  require  the
ejection  power  as  a  dreamer has  trained  to  know  all  about
Dreamland  and dreaming and thus a contact via a dream  (a  normal
dream)  is  not a threat to the dreamer.  A dreamer may  also,  in
combination with the other options, make the psionicist using  the
Dreamstalker,  believe that he has succeeded  in  his  attempt  to
enter  the  dreams  and proceed from there.  A particularly  smart
(and  somewhat cruel) dreamer could provide the Dreamstalker  with
suitable  prey, that he believes is the victim of his  power,  and
sit  back  and  watch  the psionicist chase  illusions.   Or,  the
dreamer  could  even  pretend  to flee  from  the  psionicist  and
suddenly  turn on him and attack.  By using the right  combination
of powers, a dreamer could pull the psionicist into Dreamland, and
then tear him to shreds in a matter of rounds.
     Note: this power WILL NOT work if the sleeper is in Dreamland
for  any  reason.   Dreamers consider this  power  useless,  as  a
combination of their own powers will achieve a similar effect, and
could be much more fatal in a shorter time.

Power  Score:   The psionicist can also ask one  question  as  per
Probe, or plant one suggestion as per PH suggestion.

20:   The  Dreamstalker  fails, all 40 PSP's  are  lost,  and  the
psionicist  must  make  a  save versus death  magic  or  lose  1d8
Constitution  points.   These  can only  be  regained  as  if  the
psionicist were under the effects of a Dreamstalker himself.

This  spell allows the wizard to transform himself into a drider,  the  drow-
spider  cross.  The  wizard  gains all the  abilities  of  a  drider,  except
spellcasting. The wizard can still cast his own spells normally.  The  wizard
gains  the  once-per-day innate spellcasting of drow, a poisonous  bite,  15%
magic resistance, and night vision. However, unlike similar polymorph spells,
the  wizard  must  remain  in the drider form until  the  spell  ends  or  is
dispelled.  The  wizard  who  cast  drider form  cannot  dispel  it:  another
spellcaster must do it. The wizard is not healed at the end of the spell.

The  priest must point his finger at the victim, spit to the ground  and  say
"drown to death". The victim is granted a saving throw versus death magic. If
failed,  he  dies  instantly, unless protected or  immune  to  drowning  (for
example,  water  breathing creatures). If saved, he only  receives  2d8+1  HP
damage. The victim must be in an amount of water large enough to drown in.

With this spell, the caster causes the target's lungs to fill with water. The
water  hampers breathing, and the victim will begin to suffocate after    his
Constitution   score   in  rounds  (round  up).  Thereafter,   a   successful
Constitution  check  each round with a cumulative  2  penalty  will  postpone
damage  for  an  additional round. After the first failed check,  the  victim
suffers  1d6  damage  each  round  until dead.  For  example,  Talmac  has  a
Constitution  of 17; he will begin to suffocate after 6 rounds.  On  the  7th
round,  his  player  rolls a 3   no problem, Talmac suffers  no  damage  this
round.  But on the 8th round, the player rolls a 14 (he failed by one,  since
17  4=13),  and Talmac takes 1d6 damage that round and each subsequent  round
for the remaining duration of the spell.
A  successful dispel magic cast on the victim immediately clears his lungs of
water.  A  water breathing spell cast on the victim will allow him to  ignore
the  presence  of  the  fluid  in his lungs for its  duration.  The  material
component of this spell is a fist-sized piece of pulp from a saguaro cactus.

This  spell  creates the illusion in the victim's mind of extreme exhaustion,
and  in  fact he is on the verge of collapsing and falling asleep. The victim
suffers a -4 to-hit, a +2 penalty on Armour Class, 50% vision reduction,  and
half  his  normal movement rate for the full duration of the  spell.  Wizards
have  a chance of spell failure equal to 100% - 5% per point of Intelligence.
The spell can be negated by dispel illusion, but not by dispel magic.

This  spell  is  one of the last defences a druid has. It triggers  the  most
powerful  curse  a druid can cast, but only upon the death of  the  druid  by
unnatural  forces  or by what he considers unnatural forces  (this  does  not
include the forces of an avalanche triggered by opponents unless knows it was
triggered  by  his opponents). When this curse is triggered any persons,  who
actively participated in the slaying (including giving the order to slay)  of
the druid (even if he was killed as an innocent bystander), and who are still
within an area of a hundred yards per level of the druid will be affected  by
the  curse. This curse causes a reduction of any physical abilities to 3  and
any  mental  abilities to one half unless the creatures succeed at  a  saving
throw  versus  spell.  In that case, they suffer only a  reduction  of  their
physical  abilities  to a 9 (no effect if already less) and  a  reduction  of
their mental capabilities by a quarter. Mental capabilities include number of
spells  and  the  ability scores of Intelligence, Wisdom,  and  Charisma.  In
addition to this, their hit points are halved or quartered if they succeed or
fail  at a second saving throw versus spell, respectively. These effects last
until remove curse and atonement of a druidic deity have been cast. The quest
for the atonement has to be in the druidic sense of piety.
The material components are the holy symbol of the druid, plus the amount  of
mistletoe the druid usually needs during one year. In addition, the druid has
to create a clay pot which is inlaid with rare barks from an oak which has to
have died by natural causes in its first year of growth. Into this he has  to
fill  a mixture of soils from the farthest points of the earth from all  four
cardinal  directions  (calculated from the druid's groove),  a  mixture  from
several types of water (again from the four cardinal points), and the crushed
remains  of  the  oldest scarabs still existing that died of  natural  causes
(this is the real bug). This mixture has to be sealed for a full year with  a
cork  plug and waxed paper. The whole pot including mixture must not be  kept
within 100 feet of something magical for the whole year. After that, the  pot
is  ready to be a material component for this spell. As long as this  pot  is
kept unopened within the druid's grove the spell can be kept active. Once the
pot is opened or taken from the druid's grove it becomes completely worthless
and  a  new pot has to be begun. A druid can have a maximum of one  of  these
pots at once. Note: after the one-year ageing time the pot can be kept within
100  feet  of something magical or it can be enspelled itself to be protected
from  others.  Even  if the spell is triggered the pot may  be  reused.  This
reusage (we could also say recycling) of the pot requires a ritual of one day
per druid level so it becomes attuned again to the druid.

This  rare and powerful spell allows the wizard to cast two spells  at  once.
When cast, the spell remains on standby until the wizard is ready to use  it.
On the round it is used, the wizard may cast two spells at the same time. The
total  spell  levels  cast may not exceed one third the  wizard's  experience
level.  It  is possible to have multiple castings of this spell  active;  the
wizard is limited to one per nine levels for a maximum of four.

The material component is an egg with two yolks, and a perfect crystal sphere
composed  of  spent  ioun stones, lesser shiral crystal,  and  quartz  melted
together  costing 2000 gold pieces per level of the wizard. The egg is  eaten
(fried or hard boiled) and the sphere vanishes during casting.

By  this  spell,  the  wizard helps the defence out  on  himself  or  another
creature.  If  the  wizard sees an attack coming, the wizard  can  cause  the
creature to be suddenly moved out of the way so as to cause the attacto miss.
This  will  only work against body (claws, bite, etc.) or hand-held  weapons.
The  creature  that has been moved must then take 30 seconds readjusting  his
position before it can attack again.
The  wizard must prepare for this spell, and must declare at the end  of  the
previous round that he is casting this spell. The wizard then waits until the
monster  attacks, and throws the spell. Creatures that have  never  had  this
done  to  them  before  must make a saving throw versus petrification  or  be
stunned for 2 rounds.

This  spell  is  result of a mistake. Originally intended as a less  powerful
version  of  boat  in a bottle, Ound didn't spend enough time  studying  that
spell  before  making this one. While this spell does put one creature  in  a
bottle  and then corks it, it doesn't have the power to shrink the person  so
it jams the person through the little top of the bottle, the bottle of course
being  magically  bound  as not to break. Effectively  the  spell  kills  the
creature or being and puts what remains in the bottle. Unfortunately this  is
a  messy  procedure  and  not  for those with  weak  stomachs.  The  material
components are a bottle, a cork, and a prism.

This spell causes the recipient creature to become completely dumb, believing
that  he  is  unable  to speak by means of voice in any way  (cf.  blindness,
deafness). This effect can only be removed by dispel illusion, or by the will
of the wizard, and is permanent until such time. The victim does get a saving
throw  versus  spell  to avoid the effect. Note: this  spell  could  be  very
effective against creatures such as androsphinxes, dragonnes and harpies.

This  spell enables the wizard to conjure a dust devil, a weak air elemental,
(AC  2, 2d8 HP, MV 18, damage 1d4, magic weapons inflict double damage).  The
dust  devil  appears as a small whirlwind, fifteen feet tall,  five  feet  in
diameter  at its base and twice that at its top. It will move as  ordered  by
the  wizard but vanishes if ordered more than 30 feet from the wizard  or  if
ordered to attack an native of the plane of elemental air or a creature  with
magic  resistance.  It can hold a gaseous cloud at bay,  and  its  winds  are
sufficient to put out small fires. While skimming along the ground,  it  will
pick  up loose particles (if any) and create a dust cloud 30 feet in diameter
in which normal vision is obscured, and a wizard caught within the cloud must
make  a  saving throw versus death magic or have their concentration  broken.
The material component of this spell is a small fan.

The material component for this spell is a full set of teeth from a man-sized
or  larger carnivore which must be cast on an area of earth, rock, raw stone,
sand or gravel as the spell is cast. The spell generates 1 skeleton + 1 per 2
levels  which rise from the area. They will fight for the wizard  until  they
are  turned or destroyed, the wizard is slain, rendered unconscious or  moves
out  of  spell range of the group, or the magic is dispelled. They last  only
while  there is someone to attack (including each other, if necessary) -  any
round  in  which there are no targets available the skeletons will fade  back
into dust.
If dragon's teeth are used as the material component, each skeleton will have
bonus hit points equal to the age category of the dragon (count 4 HP =  1  HD
for  turning  and attack purposes). Furthermore, they will be immune  to  the
attack type of the dragon's breath weapon.

This  spell enables the wizard to bring to life a dwarf sized stone  golem  -
which has to be constructed first - with the following statistics:

     Stone Dwarf Golem

     AC: 2
     Move: 6
     HD: 10
     Hit Points: 45
     Number of Attacks: 2
     Damage: 4-10/4-10
     Special Attacks: Hurl Rocks for 2d4 points damage
     Special Defense: None
     Magic resistance: Special
     Alignment: N
     Size: S

This  golem  is  immune to all spells that other stone  golems  are.  It  can
produce  rocks from its body and throw them up to a 30-foot range. It  cannot
take any other actions in any round in which it decides to do so, however.
The  construction time for the golem is 3 months. The golem costs 8000 gp  to
make, and after casting, the wizard must make a 1d20 roll and add 2 to it. If
the  score  is  above  his level, the spell fails and a  new  golem  must  be
constructed. If it is less or equal, the spell succeeds.

(but   not   quantity)  of  spells  normally  available  to  a   spellcaster.
Essentially,  Dwarkanath's arcane expander provides a  number  of  additional
spells  that  the wizard can select during an adventure (or  group  of  small
adventures  that  are  encompassed in the duration). It  does  not,  however,
increase the number of spells the character may cast within a day.
For  every  two levels of the caster, one additional spell level's  worth  of
spells  can  be memorised. In other words, should an eighteenth level  wizard
cast  this  spell,  he  could make selections that may be  chosen  from  when
deciding  upon  a spell to be cast. Be aware that the character  affected  by
Dwarkanath's  arcane expander must take the time to memorise  the  additional
selections.  Because  of the nature of the spell, the  recipient  must  begin
memorising  these  spells  within  1  turn  of  completing  the  casting   of
Dwarkanath's  arcane expander. If multiple spells are being  memorised,  each
must be started within one turn of the previous spell.
In  order to cast this spell, the caster must gather rare oils and spices, as
well as samples of brain tissue from specific spellcasting creatures (the  DM
should  choose something appropriate for his campaign). Generally,  the  gold
piece  costs for the material components for this spell are typically  10,000
gp.

cast,  and so forth. Non-magical skills and abilities such as weapon or  non-

After  the spell is cast, the character immediately begins to function  as  a
lower  level spellcaster. All spells previously memorised are not  lost,  but
become  inaccessible (except as noted below). For example,  if  a  10th-level
wizard casts this spell to effectively become a 4th-level wizard, he does not
forget  his 4th- and 5th-level spells, nor the extra 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-level
spells  memorised. At the time of casting, the character must announce  which
spells he is retaining for use and which are being made inaccessible.
In  order  for  the  wizard  to  regain his former  abilities,  the  material
component  (a  diamond of at least 2,000 gp in worth) must  be  crushed.  The
diamond  need  not be in possession of the caster during the  course  of  the
spell, but this is generally recommended.
During  the course of the spell, experience points are accumulated  normally.
But,  the  wizard  has  the option of applying them to  his  effective  level
instead of his true level (this must be determined at the time of casting the
spell  -  it  cannot be changed mid-stream). If the caster's effective  level
experience  points  match or exceed the actual level, Dwarkanath's  limitator
will automatically terminate.
Dwarkanath's limitator has one side effect: If the caster is under the effect
of  a  polymorph  self  before casting the spell,  it  will  last  until  the
termination of Dwarkanath's limitator. This can be useful when the magic-user
is disguising himself as a lower level character.
The  true  level  of  the caster cannot be determined via  determine  prowess
(q.v.)  or  through  any divination magic of less than fourth  level.  Dispel
magic  will not reverse the effects of Dwarkanath's limitator, but may cancel
the  effects of any polymorph self in effect. Restoration has a 3% chance per
level  of  the priest of terminating Dwarkanath's limitator. Also,  wish  can
restore the character's actual level, but not a limited wish. A limited  wish
can  be  used,  however, to cause the caster to accumulate experience  points
against the current level if such was not the case originally.

face  any number of unknowns. Specifically, this spell creates a bolt of some
material (see below) that is projected at the target creature unerringly. The
damage  caused by this spell is always the same, regardless of  the  physical
composition  of  the  bolt: 1d8 for every 2 levels of the  caster,  up  to  a
maximum  of  12d8. A saving throw versus death magic reduces  the  damage  by
half.
Dwarkanath's morphous bolt can be created with any variety of materials, such
as  fire, ice, water, acid, stone or any other physical substance allowed  by
the  DM.  All  that is required by the spell caster is that a sample  of  the
material  desired be used as a material component. Note that this must  be  a
physical material, i.e., bolts cannot be created out of magical energy  (eg.,
magic missile).
Creatures   hit   by  Dwarkanath's  morphous  bolt  suffer   advantages   and
disadvantages as appropriate for their nature. For instance, a fire giant hit
by a bolt of acid would take normal damage, but additional damage from a bolt
of ice. Likewise, a red dragon would take reduced damage from a bolt of fire.

This  spell must be cast on a container of some sort, no larger than  a  wine
cask,  which has a lid or some other means of being closed up. It  takes  one
turn to cast the spell, preparing the container to receive another spell,  of
any  level  below seventh, which must be cast in the following  round.  If  a
second  spell  is  not  cast  immediately, the magic  of  dweomervessel  will
dissipate. Once the second spell has been cast, the container must be  closed
immediately, or the second spell will be activated. If the vessel  is  closed
properly, it will effectively trap the magic for a period of time equal to  1
hour  per  level of the caster. While the vessel is closed,  there  is  a  5%
chance per hour (not cumulative) that the magic contained therein will  burst
the  lid or seal of the container and be activated; otherwise, the magic will
remain  trapped  for  the duration of the spell or until somebody  opens  the
container. There is a 3% chance per spell level that the magic will not  work
properly,  usually  fizzling or causing some minor effect.  Spells  requiring
contact  with  the  spell  recipient will only work properly  if  someone  is
holding the container when the spell is activated. Area-of-effect spells will
be  centred  on the vessel. Only one dweomervessel spell may  be  cast  on  a
single  container at any one time. If two or more such vessels are within  10
feet  of  each  other  for  an extended amount of time,  the  magics  of  the
containers  will start to clash, and the chance that it will be spontaneously
released  is increased to 5% per turn. The material components of this  spell
are  a  pint  of wine, a bar of soap, a powdered emerald of at  least  50  gp
value, and the container itself.

The  priest  casts this spell on a variable number of small rock stones,  one
per  three  experience  levels. The stones are then  filled  with  protective
energy that will last for 1d12+12 hours. The stones must be ordinary rock  of
no special value (gems, for example, are excluded) and weigh about one pound.
If the caster or any person who receives spells from the earth sphere carries
such a stone on himself, he will get bonuses to all of his saving throws  for
a day. For every five experience levels of the priest, the stone will give +1
to the saving throws of whoever carries it. For example, a 7th-level priest's
enchanted stone gives a +2 bonus to the saving throws, while a stone  from  a
11th-level priest gives a +3.
There  is  no limit to the number of the saving throws affected. The  bonuses
are  cumulative with other means of protection but not with the spell itself;
one  can  benefit from only one stone at a time. At the end  of  the  spell's
duration,  the stones crumble to dust. This spell was designed for  the  Dark
Sun campaign world. It was created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

Using  this  spell, the caster can inspect distant lands or areas  through  a
specially prepared rock crystal.
This  device  is  a  large obsidian ball, at least a yard  in  diameter.  The
craftsmanship need not be absolutely perfect but the ball must  be  carefully
prepared  using stone shape; it will take more than two weeks with continuous
use  of that spell to prepare the necessary ball. This is not consumed in the
casting.
After the manufacturing of the ball, the caster must cast earth vision on the
crystal,  followed  by  a  series  of other spells,  complete  with  all  the
necessary components. These spells must be cast within one day from the  time
the priest cast earth vision on the stone or everything is wasted.
First level: bless, detect evil, detect magic, detect poison, detect snares &
pits,  and sanctuary. Second level: detect charm, find traps, know alignment,
and  withdraw.  Third  level:  continual light, cure  blindness,  and  locate
object.  Fourth level: detect lie, divination, imbue with spell ability,  and
tongues. Fifth level: commune with nature and true seeing.
After the last of the spells has been cast, the priest must cast earth vision
again  on the stone, which unites everything together. The ball must be fixed
in  a  specially  blessed  place  and can never  be  removed  or  the  placed
enchantment is destroyed forever.
From  that  point forward, the caster can cast earth vision on the stone  and
turn  it  into a crystal-ball device. He is able to view persons or areas  on
the  same  plane, regardless of distance. In addition to the abilities  of  a
crystal  ball, the priest can cast all the divination spells from  the  above
list  through the device. The device can give a focus for magical  transport,
such as teleportation (the area is considered "studied carefully" then).
This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This  spell either creates a desired sentient ego of a certain alignment,  or
alters an existing ego of an item.
If the spell is used to create an ego, the specific personality traits of the
object are random, but the conjured alignment is determined as follows:

     D100 Roll Alignment Shift from Intended
     01-15     One place more lawful
     16-29     One place more chaotic
     30-79     As intended
     80-89     One place more good
     90-99     One place more evil
     00   Random (DM's determination)

     Lawful Good    Neutral Good   Chaotic Good
     Lawful Neutral True Neutral   Chaotic Neutral
     Lawful Evil    Neutral Evil   Chaotic Evil

This version of the spell may be cast upon a normal item, or an item that  is
already  enchanted,  provided the magical item does  not  already  contain  a
sentient  ego. In the former case, there is a 95% probability that the  spell
will  enchant  the item with magical properties besides the  ego,  which  are
determined  by  the DM; based on the physical function of the item,  its  new
alignment, and the level of the caster. In the later case there is only a  5%
chance of increasing magical abilities.
For  example, the 22nd-level wizard Trehlornam casts this spell on  a  normal
mithril  footman's mace. The wizard is attempting to "ego-ise" the weapon  to
the  alignment  of lawful good. The "alignment shift" roll is  determined;  a
roll  of  05.  The  item's new ego is to be one place more  lawful  than  the
intended.  Since  there  is no alignment more lawful than  lawful  good,  the
alignment  is as was intended. If the roll had been a 97, the item  would  be
shifted one notch more evil, thus creating an ego of lawful neutral.
Continuing  our example, it has been determined, then, that Trehlornam's  new
mace  is lawful good, as intended. Since the mace was not previously magical,
another  percentile  roll  is  determined for  the  potentiality  of  further
enchantment  of  magical properties. A roll of 47 indicates  an  affirmative.
Since  the  item is a mace, the alignment will be lawful good, and Trehlornam
is  22nd-level  the  weapon  could be, as an example,  an  undead  slayer  in
combination with having the properties of a ring of truth; where the  wielder
of the mace is not able to lie, but in exchange is able to detect lies.
When the spell is used to alter an existing ego, the wizard may attempt shift
the  alignment  to  another  specific  alignment.  The  following  chart   is
consulted:

     D100 Roll Shifted Alignment
     01-09     One place more evil
     10-19     Two places more evil
     20-54     As intended
     55-64     One place more chaotic
     65-74     Two places more chaotic
     75-00     Absolute chaotic neutral (violent psychotic traits)

If  an  ego  has been altered, and it has been determined that the  enchanted
properties of the item are to be altered as well, the change will  always  be
an  upgrade of previous abilities that are more fitting of the newly attained
alignment.
There are no material components for either function of the spell.

When  this  spell is cast, the wizard is enveloped in an invisible shroud  of
flames. True seeing or similar magic will reveal the shroud, and detect magic
will reveal strong lines of abjuration and evocation magic. The spell imparts
on the wizard the equivalent of fire resistance for the duration of the spell
(see  the  description of the ring of fire resistance in the Dungeon Master's
Guide).
In  addition to the protection aspect of this spell, the wizard may also  use
it  offensively: any target that comes within 10 feet of the  wizard  may  be
attacked using the shroud; a small finger of (clearly visible) flames  shoots
from the shroud and strikes the victim, inflicting 1d4 points of damage, plus
1  point  per  level of the wizard (up to a maximum of 1d4+20). A  successful
saving  throw versus spell reduces the damage by half. Only one  such  attack
may  be  made per round, and each attack reduces the spell's duration by  one
round  (thus,  an  attack may not be made the last  round  the  spell  is  in
affect).
Anyone who scores a successful melee hit on the wizard while he is under  the
protection of this spell suffers damage equal to that inflicted by an  attack
from  the shroud (1d4 + 1 per level); again, a successful saving throw versus
spell  reduces  the  damage by one half. The duration of  the  spell  is  not
affected in this case.

The  material  component for this spell is any normal cape with  a  chunk  of
sulphur  placed in the pocket; the cape must be worn throughout the  duration
of  the spell; if it is removed, the spell ends prematurely. The cape is  not
affected  by the casting of this spell, but the sulphur is consumed when  the
spell ends.

This  spell  is identical to Eldarr's spell conversion, except that  it  will
convert  any  spell of sixth level or less to any known loweevel  spell.  The
duration and casting time are also increased.
This spell has the additional spell component of a powdered gem (of any type)
worth  at least 400 gp (this is in addition to the were-creature pelt).  This
gem is also consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell is nearly identical to Eldarr's flameshroud; it covers the wizard
in  an invisible shroud of electricity. The shroud is detectable by the  same
means  covered in the flameshroud description. This spell provides  the  user
with  immunity to lightning and other electrical attacks for the duration  of
the spell.
The  wizard  may  use the shroud to conduct electrical attacks  in  the  same
manner  as that for flameshroud; damage is identical, and each attack reduces
the  duration  by  one round. The shroud will also provide protection  versus
melee  attacks  as  per  the  flameshroud, with electricity  again  replacing
flames.
In addition to the cape (which is not harmed), this spell requires a specimen
of  any electricity using creature, such as an electric eel; this specimen is
consumed when the spell ends.

This  spell  allows  its  wizard to convert one spell  into  another  of  the
wizard's  choice. As long as the spell conversion is in effect, when  another
spell  is cast, the wizard may choose to cast it normally, or alter  it  into
another  spell. The spell to be altered must be of third level or lower,  and
the  spell  to  be  converted  to, must be of  second  level  or  lower  (the
additional level of power is expended in the conversion process) and must  be
a  spell  the wizard already knows, although it does not have to be currently
memorised.
This  spell  is  usually cast at the beginning of a day  or  before  a  known
encounter,  to  give the wizard ample time to replace it in his  memory  with
another  spell.  Only wizard spells may be converted by this spell  -  priest
spells are not affected by it, and only the wizard's own spells are affected.
Range, duration, area of effect, and saving throws are as per the spell being
converted  to; the spell being converted determines the spell components  and
casting  time  (however,  in  order to convert  a  spell,  a  few  additional
incantations  are  necessary, and the name of the  new  spell  must  also  be
uttered; this effectively increases the casting time of the original spell by
one).
As  an  example of the use of this spell, let us assume Biff the  wizard  has
cast  this spell before a large battle; during the fight, Biff finds  himself
levitated  by  an  enemy  wizard  and to be  dropped  from  a  great  height.
Unfortunately,  Biff  has  nearly used up his complement  of  spells  in  the
battle,  and  has  a single fireball left - not much use in  this  situation.
However, since spell conversion is in effect, Biff starts the incantations of
the  fireball  anyway; when he is dropped, Biff casts the fireball  but  uses
spell  conversion  to convert it to a feather fall, floating  softly  to  the
ground unharmed.

The  material component for this spell is the pelt of any were-creature;  the
pelt is consumed with the casting.

The  wizard hurls a magical bolt of flame which does 1d6 points of damage  on
impact  and  has a 50% chance of catching the target's combustibles  on  fire

are). Victim may make a saving throw versus spell for half damage. Fire-based
creatures take no damage; cold-based take double.

This  spell  allows a caster to send an object or creature back  in  time  in
accordance with the below chart. Once in the past, an opportunity  to  relive
and  even  alter  that  portion of his existence is presented.  Upon  travel,
however,  the  creature or object returns to the state it was at  that  time,
ignoring  any gains made from that time forward, and any losses. If  what  is
sent back is sentient, all memory is retained in spite of this regression and
changes can be made. When the time at which the spell is cast is reached once
again, the spell ends and time continues as normal with the exception of  any
benefit  or curse which has occurred because of changes made. This spell  can
be  cast on any given creature only once within a one week time period.  Roll
on the following travel table:

     D100 Roll Travel Result
     01-10     Spell Failure
     11-20     2d8 hours back
     21-50     24 hours back
     51-70     1d10 + 24 hours back
     71-99     48 hours back
     00   48 hours + 1 hour per level back

The  material component of this spell is either an hourglass with  sand  from
limbo  (not destroyed in the casting) or diamond dust of at least 600  gp  in
value which is consumed in the casting.

with  two key words. The wizard then writes a message on the paper and evokes
the  first  key  word, rendering the papers contents illegible  even  to  the
writer.  The  paper remains in this condition until the second  key  word  is
spoken,  either  by  the  caster  or  the  paper's  designated  recipient.  A

removes the second key word permanently and prevent decryption forever.

      This  spell must be cast with a metal blade of some sort in each  hand.
Both  blades then acquire a flickering blue glow. When a hit by either  blade
is scored it causes 1d4 extra hit points of electrical damage. If both blades
hit  the  same  target  in  the  same  round  the  victim  must  save  versus
petrification  or be stunned for one round. Each blade only shocks  once  and
then is normal again.

This  spell is a more potent version of the 2nd-level spell shocksphere. This
spell  is  quite  similar  in  its effects, but the  effects  are  much  more
spectacular, and far more deadly.
When  this  version of shocksphere explodes, the little lightning  bolts  are
much  more  powerful, being able to push or throw objects around  during  the
moment  that the spell lasts. Therefore, not all the damage is caused by  the
electricity, one quarter of the damage caused is caused by the force  of  the
blows of the lightning bolts (this means that creatures with protection  from
electrical attacks will still take damage from this spell).
If  there  is a creature which is the target for the spell, its saving  throw
will  be at -4 and it will take (2d4 + 1 per level of the wizard) damage from
the  lightning when the spell "explodes". All other creatures in the area  of
effect  will take 1d6+1 damage per level of the wizard in hit points if  they
fail  a  normal saving throw versus spell. If a creature does fail its saving
throw, then all their objects must make their saving throws versus the  worst
of either lightning or crushing blow.
If  this spell expands in an area which is smaller than its diameter, it will
conform  to  the volume it occupies, filling a volume of 4/3    x  (level/4)3
cubic feet. Refer to the following table for the volume filled by the spell:

     Level     Volume
     14   180
     15   221
     16   268
     17   322
     18   382
     19   449
     20   524

Unlike  shocksphere, this spell will do structural damage to any man-made  or
natural  structure  in the area of effect. It will do 1 point  of  structural
damage  to wooden constructions, half that to those of soft stone,  and  only
one quarter that to those of hard stone per level of the wizard.

The  material components of this spell is a small chunk of flesh from a  blue
dragon, or any other similarly powered creature that uses electricity for its
principal  attack,  and  a  small wand of gold  (50  gp  value).  Both  these
materials disappear after the spell is cast.

This  spell  is  a  more  powerful version of the 1st-level  spell  elemental
bonding  (see  the  Dragon Kings source book). With this  spell,  the  priest
attempts to repair physical damage done to another being or creature.  In  an
elemental sense, part of the damage incurred by combat wounds or disease  is,
in  fact,  an imbalance created in the body's elemental proportions.  Through
this spell, the priest restores some of this balance.
The  caster can heal 2d4+4 points of damage. The same restrictions  apply  to
this  spell as to the 1st-level spell: the priest cannot completely heal  the
recipient with this spell. He can only heal the recipient to within 3  points
of  perfect health (unless the damage was solely from an elemental, then  all
damage  can be healed). Additional means must be used to bring the  recipient
back  to  perfect health (cure light wounds, rest, etc.). However,  elemental
bonding I cannot be used to achieve this, since both spells work on the  same
principle.
By casting the reverse of this spell, the priest does 2d4+4 points of damage.
While  no  saving  throw is allowed, a successful attack must  be  made  (the
caster must succeed in touching the target).
The  material component for this spell is enough of the caster's  element  to
sufficiently cover the recipient's wounds.

This  spell causes wood or stone to burst violently, fire to flare, or  small
volumes  of  water or air to become turbulent, possibly knocking  people  and
objects  over within a radius of twenty feet. Wood and stone will do 1d8  and
1d10  points of damage respectively to victims within ten feet of the  burst.
Fire will do 1d6 points of damage to victims within ten feet of the fire  and
2d6 to those within three feet. When the fire version is used, there is a 50%
chance  of  flammable objects within 10 feet of catching fire.  The  material
component of this spell is a bit of sulphur.

This  spell  was once a spell from the Oriental Adventures book, but  it  was
adapted for the priest. It causes one of the four elements (not five like  in
the  oriental  version)  to send off slivers of its  element  either  causing
damage  or  another effect depending on the element: earth  sends  off  sharp
slivers causing 1d8 hit points of damage; fire sends of sparks that cause 1d4
damage and cause non-magical items in the area to save versus normal fire, if
their  owner  or  carrier does not save; air and water send forth  concussive
waves of force that cause the affected characters to save versus paralysation
or  be hindered for one round per three levels of the caster (hindered equals
losing  initiative  for physical actions during those rounds).  It  does  not
significantly affect the object from which it gains the slivers of element it
shoots off.

This  spell creates a small gate from an elemental plane. It allows the  free
passage  of  objects  and creatures from the elemental  plane  to  the  prime
material only, and not the other way around. If the gate is free standing, it
will  only  last  for 2 turns + 1 round per level of the wizard.  It  may  be
supported, though, by an ornate frame that will make it last exactly as  long
as the frame itself.

     Element   Frame Type
     Air  Silver
     Fire Brass
     Water     Gold or Gilt

Also  needed as a material component of the type of material the wizard wants
the  gate to open into. For instance, if the wizard wants salt water to  spew
out  of  the  gate,  he  needs to cast the water version  with  a  sample  of
saltwater.  This  works  similarly  with  the  other  planes  -  air  of  the
appropriate freshness, temperature, etc. must exist as a sample.
The most common uses of this spell are listed below:

     Element   Spell Effect
      Air   May  be  used  to  ventilate rooms, provide breathable  air,  and
maintain average temperatures.
     Fire Often used to heat places in cold climates or serve as the heart of
a forge.
      Water      Usually  created  to  provide  large  quantities  of  fresh,
drinkable water.

If  the supporting frame is magicked with a protection from evil or good, 10-
foot  radius or similar spell, the vast majority of elemental creatures  that
might stumble across the gate will be unable to pass through.

The  bodies of most creatures are composed of a mixture of all four  elements
(air,  water, fire, and earth). With this spell, the caster creates a  slight
imbalance  in  the natural physical make up of the target by  increasing  the
proportion of one element relative to the other three. For example, a  priest
of  fire  increases  the  amount of elemental  fire  in  the  target's  body.
Increasing the amount of elemental material has two effects.
First,  the  imbalance directly affects the target's abilities  (statistics),
strengthening  some and weakening others. Specifically, four  statistics  are
always affected:

     Element   Associated Statistics    Opposing Statistics
     Air  Wisdom, Dexterity   Strength, Constitution
     Fire Dexterity, Strength Constitution, Wisdom
     Earth     Strength, Constitution   Wisdom, Dexterity
     Water     Constitution, Wisdom     Dexterity, Strength

The  caster  improves  each of the target's statistics  associated  with  his
element  by 1 point per 3 levels of the caster (to a maximum of +6),  and  he
weakens those statistics associated with the opposing element by 1 point  per
3 levels. However, no ability can be reduced to 0 or increased beyond 24.
For  example,  Samantha, an 11th-level priest of the earth,  casts  elemental
imbalance  on  Halminok whose original statistics are Strength 17;  Dexterity
15;  Constitution  15;  Intelligence 10; Wisdom 10;  and  Charisma  11.  Both
Halminok's Strength and Constitution are increased by 3 points; his Dexterity
and  Wisdom  are  decreased by 3 points each. Thus, his  statistics  for  the
duration  of  the  spell  are  Strength 20; Dexterity  12;  Constitution  18;
Intelligence  10; Wisdom 7; and Charisma 11. He enjoys all benefits  (greater
damage  bonus,  more  hit points, etc.) and suffers all  penalties  (loss  of
Dexterity   defensive  adjustment,   1  magical  defense  adjustment,   etc.)
associated  with  his  new statistics. When the spell  ends,  his  statistics
immediately  return to normal, and thus his abilities return to  normal  (hit
points  gained as a result of increased Constitution are lost  only  if  they
exceed his normal limit).
The  second effect of this spell is to provide modest protection against  the
element  which has been increased. The target receives a +1 to  Armour  Class
versus  elementals  from the protected plane and all  saving  throws  against
elemental-based attacks from this element. However, the target suffers  a   1
to  Armour  Class versus elementals from the opposite plane  and  all  saving
throws  against attacks from the opposing element. Thus, Halminok would  save
with  a  +1 against flesh to stone, but he would suffer a  1 penalty  to  his
Armour  Class  in  a  battle  against an air  elemental.  These  bonuses  are
cumulative  with  non-magical  bonuses (Dexterity  reaction  adjustment,  for
example) and with other magical protections (magical armour, for example).
This spell is traumatic for the target. At the end of the spell, he must make
a  system shock roll (using his normal Constitution). If he succeeds, nothing
happens. If he fails, he instantly loses 4 HP per 3 levels of the caster  (to
a  maximum of 24 HP)   that is 1 HP for each 3 levels of the caster for  each
ability  modified.  This loss is permanent and cannot be  cured  via  natural
means,  nor  do any of the usual curative spells (cure serious wounds,  heal,
regenerate,  etc.) work. The damage can not be removed via  remove  curse  or
dispel magic. There are only two known means of restoring hit points lost  in
this  manner: elemental bonding and wish. For the former to have the  desired
effect,  the target must have been cured of all other wounds first  (if  not,
elemental  bonding will function normally, curing the existing wounds  within
three  hit  points  of  the post-drain level). In this case,  the  target  is
treated  as  if  all  damage  was suffered from an elemental,  and  elemental
bonding will restore drained hit points as per that spell.
An  elemental priest can only increase the amount of elemental material  from
his  plane  of  worship.  A  Dark Sun druid may only  increase  the  elements
associated with his guarded lands. For example, a druid who has access to the
elemental  spheres  of  fire  and earth may increase  the  amount  of  either
element. A templar may cast this spell in any form. The subject may be  under
the  influence of only one elemental imbalance at a time; if he is the target
of  a  second casting of this spell while the first is still in effect,  both
spells  are  instantly negated. If cast on an unwilling subject,  the  priest
must  succeed  in  touching the victim (make a successful attack  roll).  The
victim  is allowed a saving throw only if he is currently under the influence
of  an elemental imbalance spell or if he is currently protected against  the
element (for example, wearing a ring of fire resistance). In either case, the
target  is considered to be the target of an elemental attack and all  normal
rules apply (with respect to saving throw bonuses, for example).
This  spell has no effect on beings native to the inner planes, nor  does  it
affect  undead. The material components are the caster's holy  symbol  and  a
small amount of the element to be increased.

With  this  spell, the wizard physically joins his body with an elemental.  A
saving  throw  is possible only if the elemental is not one  the  wizard  has
conjured.  Once the wizard's body has joined with the elemental,  the  wizard
can  use all the abilities of the elemental's body as his own, including  Hit
Dice,  THAC0,  damage,  movement and invulnerability  to  non-magic  weapons.
However,  as  the wizard's body and any equipment on it are transformed  into
the  appropriate element and joined with the elemental's body, this equipment
cannot  be used in any way while inside the elemental's body. The only spells
that  can  be  cast  are  those  not  requiring  material  components  (those
components  are  stuck  inside  the elemental's  body),  and  even  then  the
elemental must be able to speak (I don't think most can).
The  wizard may end the spell at any time. The wizard's body appears anywhere
within  10  feet  of the elemental. If the elemental is one  the  wizard  has
conjured, he may dismiss it at the same time; if not, the elemental is likely
to be furious, so the wise wizard will be cautious. Note that both caster and
elemental will be confused and disoriented (no action) for 1 round after  the
separation.  The  maximum duration in any case is 1 turn  per  level  of  the
caster.
There  are several important things to note about this spell. First,  if  the
elemental's body is slain with the wizard inside, the wizard dies. Second, if
the  spellcaster is attempting to take over an elemental conjured by  another
wizard,  the elemental gets the saving throw of its conjuring wizard  or  its
own  (whichever is better); in either case, there is a +2 bonus (representing
the  prior claim of control by the conjurer). Third, the new body takes  some
getting used to; the caster is at -2 to-hit for the first 2 strikes he  takes
against an opponent.

This  spell  enables the caster to assume a special "elemental  form"  for  a
limited period of time.
The  caster can become a lesser elemental from a sphere he has at least minor
access  or a standard elemental from a sphere he has major access. The lesser
elemental  will have 6 Hit Dice and the standard elemental will have  12  Hit
Dice  (roll for hit points for each casting, adding any Constitution  bonuses
to  each  dice). Hit Dice affect the hit points, THAC0 and Armour Class,  but
the caster retains his own saving throw numbers.
The change takes place within a single round, during which the caster can  be
attacked  and be hit automatically by any kind of attack. If he dies  in  the
elemental form, he immediately returns to his own form allowing for  possible
resurrection.
When in elemental form the caster gains the abilities of the elemental. He is
immune to exposures to that element and can only be hit by enchanted weapons.
If  a  dispel  magic is successfully cast on him, he returns to his  original
form  immediately and dies if he fails a system shock roll. When  the  caster
returns  normally  to his original form, he gains 2d12  HP.  This  spell  was
designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

By  means  of this spell, the elementalist inscribes a square into a  circle.
Within  the  square,  the  wizard is protected  from  elementaland  elemental
forces,  though  it  is impossible to cast spells of an elemental  nature  in
order  to  attack  outside the square or bring elemental  forces  inside  the
square.  The  material components for this spell are a vial  of  water,  some
dust,  and burning incense, that must be placed in three of the four  corners
of  the  square.  The wizard must blow in the fourth corner to  complete  the
spell.

This  spell drives out true elementals of one designated type when the  spell
is  cast. If the elemental fails its saving throw versus death magic, it must
leave the area of effect and cannot return for the duration of the spell. Any
elemental that cannot leave the area, or is forced into a position  where  it
cannot escape the spell, immediately withdraws to its own plane. The spell is
centred  on  the  wizard, and moves with him. The spell does  not  break  the
concentration  of  any creature controlling the elemental,  or  affect  other
creatures  from  the elemental planes. The material component  is  a  bit  of
element  from the plane opposite to the one being affected - fire  for  water
elementals, water for fire elementals, a puff of air for earth elementals and
earth for air elementals.

This spell allows the caster to create a stationary wall composed of material
from  his  elemental plane of worship (templars may cast this  spell  in  any
form). As with minor and lesser elemental walls, elemental wall covers a  20-
foot-square  area per level (the thickness varies depending on the  element);
this  area may be arranged in any manner to form a rectangular wall, as  long
as  neither  dimension falls below 5 feet. While this  set  of  spells  share
common  characteristics,  such as duration and area  of  effect,  the  wall's
specific properties differ based on its composition.

     Element   Properties
      Air   Creates a deafening wall of violently disturbed air that  is  two
feet  thick.  Treat  as a wall of sound (page 78, Complete Bard's  Handbook),
however the roar of an air wall is so intense that anyone passing through the
wall suffers damage as per shout (page 163, Player's Handbook) and suffers  a
3 penalty to his saving throw.
      Water      Creates  a  vertical wall of ice. Treat as  an  "ice  plane"
version of a wall of ice (page 164, Player's Handbook).
     Fire Creates a billowing wall of smoke that is 10 feet thick. Similar to
incendiary cloud (page 189, Player's Handbook), on the third round it  erupts
into flame (3d2) and continues to flame for the fourth (3d4) and fifth rounds
(3d2).  A saving throw versus spell is allowed to halve damage. On subsequent
rounds,  it is identical to a lesser fire wall, except that the heat  remains
intense, and those within the wall suffer 1 point of damage each round.
      Earth     Creates a wall of sand that is 1 foot thick per level of  the
caster. Treat as a wall of sand (in the Forgotten Realms Adventures). Namely,
the  sand  is thick and viscous, reducing movement through the wall  to  half
speed. All creatures relying on normal sight or infravision are blinded while
within  the wall, and they suffer a  3 penalty to their Armour Class for  the
round  after leaving the wall. Creatures needing to breath suffer 1 point  of
damage  per  round spent within the wall. The wall extinguishes open  flames,
prevents speech within it, and blocks all sight through it.

The  material component is a bit of the element (air, water, fire, earth)  of
which the wall is composed.

The  caster  can  cause  air to vanish. He can create a  sphere  of  absolute
vacuum,  one  foot in diameter per experience level, around a target  of  his
choice. The target then suffers the consequences of vacuum.
          Normal fires are extinguished (magical dispelled as per the spell).
           Normal  liquid boils and evaporates (magical dispelled as per  the
spell).
           Living  creatures  that  need to breathe,  suffocate  immediately.
Because of the vacuum, all damage from suffocation is doubled.
           If  cast  directly at air elementals and other  creatures  of  the
elemental  plane  of  air,  they must save versus death  magic  or  be  slain
immediately; if they save, they suffer 4d4 HP.
Air priests may be offended by the use of this spell, especially if cast with
no  obvious  reason  or benefit. This spell was designed  for  the  Dark  Sun
campaign world.

The  caster can use this spell to cause matter to vanish. The target must  be
an  inanimate object made of stone or metal or other earthly material (undead
not  included).  The item can weigh as much as 10 pounds  per  level  of  the
caster. Items heavier than this are not affected at all.
The  item must save versus disintegration or be totally destroyed, in a quiet
"puff".  Nothing  remains.  If cast against magically  created  or  enchanted
stone, metal, etc., the item saves versus disintegration with a +10 bonus. If
cast  directly at creatures from the plane of earth, these must  save  versus
death magic at +2 or be slain immediately; if they save, they suffer 6d6  HP.
The same holds for creatures such as stone golems.
Earth  priests may be offended by the use of this spell, especially  if  cast

This  spell  can be used against any normal fire, as large as  three  10-foot
squares  per  level of the caster. The caster can extinguish the  fire  as  a
whole  or diminish it slowly. He can also create a special "path" inside  the
fire, which is 5 feet per level long and ten feet per level wide, around him.
The  caster  and his comrades, as named during the casting, can walk  through
the  fire  without any damage. If thus cast, the spell will last at most  for
one round per level.
Due  to  the  extreme stretch on the caster's body, he must  rest  for  three
rounds  (effectively,  his Strength becomes 3 for this period).  If  directly
cast  against  fire  creatures, these must save  versus  death  magic  or  be
destroyed.
Fire  priests  may be offended by the use of this spell, especially  if  cast

The  fire priest uses this spell to turn water into steam. The maximum amount
of water that can be transformed this way is 75 gallons per level.
Creatures living inside the water must save versus death magic each round  or
die.  They will eventually die if they cannot breathe air or whatever  exists
in  the area. Those who approach or stand within 10 feet of the boiling water
suffer  4d6  HP, save versus breath weapon for half damage. Those inside  the
steam are burned for 8d6 HP (those on a vessel for example).
The  water  to be affected must be gathered together in a defined  mass.  The
spell  has  no  significant effect against moisture  or  the  like  (it  just
evaporates one or two drops). If cast at creatures from the plane  of  water,
these  must save versus death magic at  3 or be vaporized; if they  make  the
saving  throw, they take 3d8 HP if they are near a source of water or 6d8  HP
if not.
Water  priests may be offended by the use of this spell, especially  if  cast
with  no obvious reason or benefit. This spell was designed for the Dark  Sun
campaign world.

Sage's  note: this spell leaves much room for creative spellcasting,  but  is
also very restricted and narrowly defined. Please read with care.
With this spell, the caster can instill in one intelligent creature an erotic
fascination  with a single kind of object, behaviour (such  that  the  sight,
smell,  sound, etc.). A sample of that designated kind of object or behaviour
arouses  the subject uncontrollably, and such that erotic pleasure or  orgasm
is impossible without the presence of the fetish object or behaviour.
Some  representative examples of fetish objects are red hair,  spiked  heels,
whips, jewelled short swords, oak leaves, artificial limbs or amputees, green
tunics,  tuna,  cheese,  sheep, gnomes, gnolls, red dragons'  tongues,  royal
guards  in  uniform,  children, octogenarians,  members  of  one's  immediate
family,  psionicists, rangers, mermaids, lawful neutrals, and Red Wizards  of
Thay.  Some  representative examples of fetish behaviours  are  having  small
insects  and  snails crawl all over one's body, inflicting  pain  on  another
person,  inflicting  pain  on  oneself, being strangled,  strangling  another
person,  being  bound,  binding another person, being charmed  or  commanded,
staging one's own mock execution, and innkeepers' daughters pouring beer down
one's chest.
This  spell is extremely versatile and may be made as detailed and  kinky  as
desired. Extremely detailed or nearly impossible fetishes, however, may occur
so  rarely  or  be so beyond the capacity of the subject to locate  or  bring
about  that the spell has little effect on the subject's life than to  create
enormous  sexual  frustration. Danger, pride,  and  personal  cost  are  not,
however, enough to dissuade the subject from the fetish once it has been made
available.
This spell cannot create a fetish for an individual person or object (Carolyn
Greycloak  or the Great Ruby of al-Ghasar, for example). Nor can it,  without
the  aid  of  another spell, create homosexual desires in a heterosexual,  or
vice versa.
There  is no saving throw per se against the fetish. Rather, upon discovering
the  fetish,  the subject, if strenuously disapproving, is allowed  a  Wisdom
check  at -4. A successful check leaves the subject humiliated but thereafter
free  from the fetish. A new Wisdom check may be attempted once per day,  but
since  fetishes  gain  strength over time, the  check  suffers  a  cumulative
penalty of -1 per day. A Wisdom check of 1 is always successful.

The  material  component  of  this spell is a sample,  highly  representative
object of the fetish, or an enactment of the fetish behaviour on the part  of
the spellcaster.

This  spell allows the priest to read the emotion of the creatures  that  the
priest  concentrates on. One creature is readable per round, and  the  priest
must  be of higher level than the target's level or Hit Dice. The priest must
be  able  to  see  the target's face. The material component  is  simply  the
priest's holy symbol.

When  cast,  this spell completely encases the target in volcanic  rock.  The
casing  does  not hinder breathing due to its porous nature, and  the  victim
suffers no damage; however, it does block vision and prevent all movement for
the duration of the spell, including somatic and verbal spell components.
If the target saves versus spell, he completely avoids the effects of encase,
as  a hollow stone statue roughly his shape appears next to him, collapses in
on  itself,  and  disappears. If the target fails his  saving  throw,  he  is
immediately  encased. Each round thereafter, he may attempt  to  break  free.
Breaking free requires the entire round and a successful bend bars/lift gates
roll.
The  volcanic casing will crumble after suffering 15 points of damage plus  1
point  per  level  of the caster. For damage purposes, treat  the  casing  as
having  an  Armour  Class  of 5. Any attack that damages  the  casing  has  a
probability of wounding the victim within; divide the damage equally  between
the  casing and the victim. In addition, the victim automatically incurs  all
damage above the amount required to destroy the casing. For example, Chluckla
is encased by a 10th-level priest, creating a casing with 25 HP. His comrades
attempt to free him by chipping him free. Blitz strikes the casing and does 6
points  of damage and rolls a 2 on 1d4   the casing takes 3 points of  damage
and  Chluckla  takes 3 points of damage. Taraq does 12 points of  damage  and
rolls  a 4   the casing takes all 12 points of damage. Finally, Morgart  does
28  points  of damage, rolling a 1   Chluckla takes 14 points of damage,  and
the casing takes 14 points; however, since the casing had only 10 HP left (25
3  12),  the  remaining  4  points  damage are  applied  to  Chluckla.  Thus,
Chluckla's  friends inflict a total of 21 points of damage  (3+14+4)  to  him
while trying to free him.
A  successful  dispel magic will immediately remove the casing. The  material
component for this spell is a fist-size piece of volcanic rock.

This  spell confers extraordinary endurance to one creature, lasting one  day
per level of the caster beyond the ninth. During this time, the recipient  is
treated  as  having the "endurance" proficiency. In addition, it can  fail  a
saving throw only on a natural 1.
The  material component is a piece of any turtle shell and a precious  stone,
worth  at  least 10 gp, which vanishes at the end of the spell duration.  The
recipient must keep the stone on himself to get the benefits.
This  spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary  units
are for the Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

This  spell  is similar to the 1st-level endure cold or heat. It  causes  the
protected  creature  to  take  no  damage from  natural  phenomena  that  are
connected to water. If a magical force simulating these phenomena (see  below
for  examples) hits the protected creature, this spell may subtract 10 HP  of
damage after the saving throws are rolled. After reducing the damage once  in
this  way,  the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell ends when the duration  runs
out.  In  contrast to endure cold or heat, this spell does not end if another
elemental  force  hits the protected creature; the spell  ends  only  if  its
duration runs out or if the creature is hit by the appropriate magical  force
(even if it causes less than 10 HP of damage). The material component is  the
holy symbol of the priest.
Endure water is for those that don't fancy to be pounded by huge waves on the
ocean,  those that don't like to get wet in the rain (or in the  sea),  those
that don't like to be flooded by a transmute dust to water, which is normally
quite  a  killer  spell (one cubic yard of water normally weighs  nearly  one
ton), etc.

This  spell  allows  the wizard to bestow a Charisma of -1  on  any  creature
unless  the  saving throw versus spell is made. Creatures with high  Charisma
get  to add 1 to their saving throw per point of Charisma above 14. Creatures
with  low  Charisma subtract 1 from their saving throw per point of  Charisma
below  8.  Any  normal  creature seeing a being with negative  Charisma  will
attack it immediately trying to kill it in any way possible. The spell has no
effect on gods and demigods. Creatures above 5 HD or fifth level get a saving
throw  as to whether they attack the spell's recipient. The negative Charisma
effect  can  be  negated  by making the recipient invisible  to  normal  view
(invisibility, darkness, etc.). The spell can also be negated by a successful
dispel magic. The material components of this spell are a hemlock bud  and  a
small piece of onyx.

Makes  an  enemy blink if its saving throw is failed. Otherwise  it  is  like
blink. Good for use if the enemy is near a cliff or large body of water.  The
number  of  creatures affected is determined randomly, by  rolling  4d6.  You
cannot  make  people save twice, i.e., "I've got 12, I use them all  on  him,
have him save 12 times" won't work.

This  fireball-like  spell inflicts all of its damage with  positive  matter.
Consequently, it heals 1d6 HP per level of the wizard. Negative matter beings
suffer 4d6 HP of damage per level of the wizard.
The  reverse, negative ball, of this spell also exists. It drains  one  level
per  10  levels the wizard possesses. A successful saving throw halves damage
and negates the energy drain.

The material component for the positive matter version is a white pearl worth
at least 1000 gp. The negative version uses a black pearl of similar value.

      This  spell is a variation to the 1st-level magic missile.  Instead  of
magical  energy,  the missiles are made of pure light drawn from  the  quasi-
elemental  plane  of  radiance. An attack roll versus  AC  10,  adjusted  for
Dexterity and magical bonuses is needed to touch the target. Undead creatures
must save versus rod to avoid taking maximum damage.

This  spell is identical to Bigby's besieging bolt in every way, except  that
it  is  a  bolt of positive energy, and only one bolt is fired.  Like  energy
ball,  negative matter creatures take triple damage. It also has  a  reverse,
negative bolt, which drains one level per 10 levels of the wizard.

The  material components for these spells are a flawless diamond, and a black
diamond respectively, each worth at least 1000 gp.

This  spell  functions  almost identically to the  3rd-level  lighting  bolt.
However,  as it is a pure beam of light energy drawn from the quasi-elemental
plane of radiance, undead creatures must save versus spell twice to take only
half  damage.  The  material component is an ebony rod of  at  least  1  foot

A  psionicist  with this power can convert energy  that  has  been
contained with energy containment, into PSPs at a 5:1 ratio (i.e.,
five  hit  points  of absorbed damage to every one  new  PSP).   A
psionicist my never have more then his maximum +10% in  total  PSP
at  any one time. All unconverted energy will still be released as
light  as  the  guide  lines for energy  containment  state.   All
thenergy  does  not have to be converted at once.   Once  all  the
absorbed  energy  is  converted to PSPs the psionicist  will  stop
glowing.

Power Score:  The conversion ratio becomes 1:1.

20:   The psionicist loses half his PSPs and all contained  energy
is discharged harmlessly into the ground.

This  power allows the psionicist to discharge the absorbed damage
he  has contained with energy containment, as a bolt of electrical
energy.  This discharge will do the number of hit points in damage
that  the psionicist has left over, unradiated as light.  He  will
then  lose his glow and will not be able to discharge again  until
he absorbs more damage with energy containment.

Power Score:  The discharge does double damage.

20:   The discharge back fires and hits the psionicist.  This time
it can not be absorbed and does full damage.

This  spell creates an invisible field of energy which is impermeable to  the
passage  of  magical  and psionic energies through its  barriers.  Thus,  for
example,  creatures  inside the area of effect are completely  unaffected  by
spells  which are cast outside the spell area. Similarly people  outside  are
not  affected  by  spells  from inside (note that, since  magic  cannot  pass
through  this  barrier, creatures cannot teleport, plane shift, etc.  through
the  barrier). Energy field does not, however, offer any physical  protection
whatsoever.
Spells  which  cause physical damage can destroy the shield but these  spells
must  do  a  total damage of 6 HP per level of the wizard. Disintegrate  will
cause  the shield to make a saving throw versus death magic at the  level  of
the  wizard. If it saves, the spell has no effect. If it fails then the spell
does  1d8  points + 1 point per level of the wizard damage to  the  field.  A
magic missile actually heals the field on a one-to-one hit point basis.
The  shield, if cast upon the wizard, moves with the wizard. If the spell  is
cast  upon another creature, it may make a saving throw versus spells. If  it
fails  its saving throw, the field follows the creature. If the saving  throw
is  made  then  the spell becomes rooted to the target area.  Otherwise,  the
spell remains stationary until the spell's duration expires.

The  material component for this spell is a diamond cube of not less than 500
gp  value.  This  cube will shatter when the spell expires or  the  field  is
brought down by spell damage.

In  order  to cast this spell, the caster must have negative plane protection
cast upon him. The spell summons energy from the positive material plane  and
sends  it around caster. Every undead creature in the field must save  versus
death  magic  or be utterly destroyed. If the saving throw is successful,  it
takes  1d4+1 points of damage per level of the caster and is blinded for  1d6
rounds.  If  it  saves versus spell, it is not blinded and  takes  only  half
damage.  All  living  creatures in the field must save  versus  spell  or  be
stunned and blinded for 1d6 rounds.
Any  magic  resistance the undead or creatures from the  lower  planes  might
have,  is  reduced by 2% per level of the caster, because positive energy  is
very hard for them to resist.
The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a ball
of platinum worth at least 1000 gp. These are not consumed by the spell. When
the  caster completes this spell, he must roll a system shock check  or  pass
out for 1d6 turns because of the massive energy surge that goes through him.

When cast, this spell will absorb 6 HP of damage per level of the wizard. The
spell  will  protect  against  all spells which inflict  direct  (hit  point)
damage,  and  physical attacks. Gases and magics which do not  directly  harm
their victims (charms, polymorphs, etc.) are unaffected.
For  magics  which  slay  instantly, such as disintegrate  and  death  spell,
subtract  the recipient's maximum hit points from the energy shield.  If  the
shield cannot absorb them all, the recipient suffers the remainder in damage.

The material component is a miniature adamantite shield with a diamond set in
the centre worth not less than 3000 gp. This shield is lost in the casting.

In  order  to cast this spell, the caster must have negative plane protection
cast  upon  him.  That spell gives the caster a connection  to  the  positive
material  plane. By means of energy strike, the caster is able to draw  extra
energy from the connection and cast it against an opponent. The caster  forms
a  narrow  bolt  of raw positive energy, which strikes the desired  creature.
Living creatures must save versus spell or be stunned for 2d6 rounds. Undead*
get  1d4+1  points of damage per level of the caster (save versus  spell  for
half).  Any inanimate object must save versus disintegration (with +4  bonus)
or be blown to pieces.
The  caster is also able to use the extra energy to Cloak himself in it. This
option  reduces  the duration of negative plane protection  to  1  round  per
level. The caster is surrounded by a visible aura of shimmering energy.  This
can  be sensed by intelligent undead* to be positive energy, and they can opt
not  to attack the caster. Any energy drain attacks are saved against with  a
+4  bonus and attacking undead* always gets 1d4+1 points of damage per  every
two levels of the caster (no saving throw).
The material components of this spell are the holy symbol of the priest and a
wand  of  platinum worth at least 500 gp. This wand is not  consumed  by  the
spell, it only directs the energy surge to desired direction.
* This also goes for creatures from the lower planes. The magic resistance of
these  creatures  is reduced by 1% per level of the caster, because  positive
energy is very hard for them to resist.

This spell enhances the druid's shapechanging power. This enhancement has the
following effects:
           it  is now possible to shapechange into any animal type (reptiles,
fish, amphibians, invertebrates, etc.);
          it is now possible to repeatedly assume the same animal type;
          the size assumed may be from 0.01% (about the size of a flea) up to
10,000%  (one hundred times larger); as this includes both aspects of  length
and  weight, it is still very easy to reach a limit rather quickly  (thinking
of  changing into a killer whale weighing well over 15 tons, your druid would
have to weigh over 300 pounds);
           the  druid  can shapechange up to 3 times plus once per  remaining
level per day;
          changing shape now takes only the thought (and approximately half a
second) to assume the new form   it is possible to assume another animal form
directly from one animal form; it is not necessary to return to human form in
the interim;
          it still cures 10% 60% of remaining damage for each return to human
form (not necessarily the druid's original shape).
This spell is powered by the recipient's levels. It drains one level from the
recipient's druidic level for the duration of the spell. If this would  leave
the  druid  below the level to shapechange, he would lose that ability.  When
the  duration  runs  out,  the druid regains the  lost  level.  The  material
component is the holy symbol of the priest.

This spell is one way for wizards to add actual substance to their illusions.
Up  to  two  rounds  before  casting an illusion (notably  phantasmal  force,
improved phantasmal force or spectral force), the wizard casts this spell  on
the  area  in  which  the  illusion is to initially appear.  Once  cast,  the
illusion then does 10% of the actual damage that it would do if it were  real
if  the victim made a saving throw against it, and is treated as normal  with
respect to Armour Class, attacks, etc., if the victim failed the saving throw
and doesn't recognise it as an illusion. The illusion also becomes AC 10, and
gains  10%  of  the  hit points it would normally have; however,  illusionary
creatures may never have more combined Hit Dice than the wizard.
If  the  illusion is not cast in the enhanced area within 2 rounds the former
spell  will be wasted. Multiple enhance illusions on one illusion will cancel
each  other. This spell can also be used in conjunction with shadow monsters,
demi-shadow  monsters  or  shades, adding 10% more realism  to  that  already
inherent in the spell, and lowering the perceived Armour Class by 1.
Enhance  illusion is attributed to the deceased wizard Scaurlin Oberlin,  who
died  in  a  magical  duel  with a grey slaad he  summoned  and  subsequently
released.  This is reputedly the only spell Scaurlin ever wrote in  his  once
promising career.

With  this  spell, a wizard can temporarily enhance the power  of  a  poison,
either making it more deadly, debilitating or potent, such as adding a -1  to
the  saving throw of the subject. This spell can only be used once on a given
dose of poison. Multiple castings of this spell don't work.
The  reverse  of  this  spell, dilute poison, makes  a  poison  less  lethal,
granting  a +1 to the subject's saving throw or making it less effective.  If
cast  on  a subject already having poison in his system, this spell grants  a
new saving throw. If cast to dilute the poison of a monster, the monster must
be  touched to be effective. Secondly, the monster gets a saving throw versus
spell.

The material component of this spell is either a dead black widow spider,  or
a dove's feather for the reverse.

This  spell enhances the striking power of a weapon. The weapon now functions
a  bit  like  a flame blade. For the duration of the spell, the weapon  glows
with  a fiery aura and causes 1d4 points + 1 point per 2 levels of the caster
damage  (in  addition  to  its normal damage), due to  the  searing  heat  it
radiates.  Unfortunately, it also causes 1 point of damage per round  to  its
user  (as  long  as he holds it), for the same reason. Undead  and  creatures
especially vulnerable to fire take 2 additional points of damage.
If the creature is protected from fire, the damage inflicted is reduced by  4
(for a minimum of 0). The weapon can ignite combustible materials. It is not,
however, considered to be a magical weapon. The spell does not function under
water.  Already enchanted weapons cannot be enhanced this way.  The  material
components of the spell are a bit of coal and the caster's holy symbol.

This   power  allows the psionicist to temporarily  enhance  melee
weapon   or   a  projectile (i.e., no bows or slings, but  arrows,
sling  stones   and  throwing  weapons  are  ok),   so   that   it
becomes   the  equivalent  of weapon with  magical  bonuses.   The
psionicist  must  touch  (or  wield) the  weapon  to  do  so.   By
spending  the necessary PSP's and making  the  power  check,   the
weapon  gets a the equivalent of a +1 magical bonus, which may  be
maintained  by  spending  3  PSP's per  round.   Note   that   the
psionicist  must  actually touch the weapon in order  to  maintain
this  power;  thus,  it is impossible to maintain  the  power  for
missile weapons (unless they return to the user), or if the weapon
is  knocked  out  of  the  psionicists  hands.  It is possible  to
add the bonus  to  an already magical weapon, or to use this power
repeatedly (creating  enhancements  of  two  or  more).   However,
the   maximum  enhancement  that  can be achieved by use  of  this
power is one 'plus' for  every 4 levels of the psionicist (i.e., 1
at levels 1 to 4, 2 at levels 5 to 8, etc.)

Power Score:  The weapon gets a +2 bonus.

20:   The weapon is damaged, it must save vs disintegration or  be
destroyed.

This  spell is identical to the 1st-level armour spell except that it confers
10  points  of  Armour  Class reduction instead of 4. Note  that  it  is  not

do not confer 14 points of Armour Class reduction.

This  is  a real 'Use the force Luke' type power.  In essence,  it
allows   the  psionicist  to  mentally  guide  and enhance his/her
attacks  and  defenses,  making them faster and more accurate.  To
do  this,  the  psionicist  must  first  make  a power check,  and
spend  a number   of  PSP's  (maximum  is  twice  the  psionicists
level)   to initialize  the  power.   In  the next round, and  for
as long as this power is maintained, the following may be done (at
the listed cost in PSP's).
      Add   +1   to hit and damage to your attacks this  round  (3
PSP's).* Add +1  to hit and damage to your next attack (2  PSP's).
Plus  improve your AC and  initiative  by  one (2 PSP's).*  Attack
first in the round (i.e., before  initiative - like someone with a
scimitar  of speed or a short sword   of  quickness)  (4  PSP's).*
Use   one   of   your  attacks  to automatically  parry,   without
having  to roll a die (5 PSP's).  Plus dodge an  attack,   without
having to roll or give up one of your attacks (8 PSP's).Plus  gain
another   attack   this   round (8 PSP's).*  Recover  your  weapon
(after   is   has  been  dropped).   This counts as  one  of  your
attacks (4 PSP's).  As well:
      *   This  action  must  be announced at the beginning of the
round.   Plus this  action  must  be announced before  the  attack
(or  parry)  roll  is attempted.   Thus  a  missed   attack   roll
cannot  be  retroactively improved.
      NOTE:   In  any given round, the psionicist may never  spend
more  PSP's  than  were used to initialize the power.  Thus  if  8
PSP's  were spent on initialization, it would be possible to dodge
one  attack,  or gain  an  extra  attack  (or  do   anything  else
that  costs  8 PSP's or less),  but  it would not be  possible  to
gain  an  extra attack and get +1  to  hit  and  damage,  as  this
would  cost  11  PSP's.  The power is maintained as  long  as  the
psionicist uses this power.  It ends on any round during which the
psionicist does not spend any PSP's on it.  In order  to  maintain
this power, spending one PSP per round is enough, although it does
absolutely nothing.

Power Score:  The  amount  of PSP's which could be spent per round
is doubled (no increase in initialization cost).

20:   Until   the   psionicist  gets  at  least  4 hours  of  rest
(preferably sleep), he/she has a -1 penalty to hit, to damage,  to
AC, to initiative as well as all saving throws.

This  science  is  a  more  powerful version  of  the  infravision
devotion,  without  the  side  effects  of  that  power   (namely,
worsening  the character's ability to see into the blue  areas  of
the  spectrum).  This science actually creates more  color-sensing
pigments  in  the character's eyes, allowing for superior  vision.
Demihumans  can  use  this power, but it is  not  cumulative  with
innate infravision (an elf with infravision to 60 feet using  this
power gains infravision with a range of 90 feet, not 150).

Power Score:  Range increases to 120 feet.

20:  The character botched the pigment creation, and becomes blind
for 2-12 rounds.

This  spell  is  an improved version of encase. When cast, entomb  completely
surrounds  the target in granite. The tomb hinders breathing, blocks  vision,
and prevents all movement, including somatic and verbal spell components, for
the duration of the spell.
If the target saves versus spell, he completely avoids the effects of entomb,
as  a hollow stone statue roughly his shape appears next to him, collapses in
on  itself,  and  disappears. If the target fails his  saving  throw,  he  is
immediately  entombed.  The  victim  will  begin  to  suffocate  after    his
Constitution   score   in  rounds  (round  up).  Thereafter,   a   successful
Constitution  check  each round with a cumulative  2  penalty  will  postpone
damage  for  an  additional round. After the first failed check,  the  victim
suffers 1d6 damage each round until dead.
A  victim  may attempt to break free of his tomb. Breaking free requires  the
entire  round and a successful bend bars/lift gates roll with a   1%  penalty
per  level  of the caster. In addition, suffocation weakens the  victim  such
that  he  loses 1 point of Strength each round he suffers suffocation  damage
(his  Strength  cannot  fall below 1, however), which  will  lower  his  bend
bars/lift lates percentage.
The  granite  tomb will crumble after suffering 25 points of  damage  plus  2
points per level of the caster. For damage purposes, treat the tomb as having
an  Armour  Class  of  0.  Any  attack that damages  the  casing  has  a  25%
probability of wounding the victim within; divide the damage equally  between
the  tomb  and the victim. In addition, the victim automatically  incurs  all
damage above the amount required to destroy the tomb.
A  successful  dispel magic will immediately remove the  tomb.  The  material
component for this spell is a fist-size piece of granite.

This  devotion allows the psionicist to weaken the victim's  sense
of balance. There is nothing physically wrong with the person, but
the  disruption  prevents  him or her  from  maintaining  balance.
Walking becomes difficult, spells may fail due to lack of balance,
and skills are harder to perform.
      The  victim is allowed a saving throw versus death.  If  the
save   is   successful,  the  victim  retains  most   of   his/her
equilibrium, causing all attacks or actions to be made at a -1  or
-5% penalty.  Movement is at 75% normal speed, spells of 7th level
or  higher  cannot be cast, and there is a general  5%  chance  of
spell failure. If the saving throw is failed, all actions are at a
-3  or  -15% penalty, the maximum movement rate is 1/3 the  normal
rate,  and  spells of 5th level or higher cannot be  cast.  Spells
that  are  cast have a 15% chance of failure. If the character  is
near  any  height greater than 15 feet, vertigo strikes, worsening
all  penalties by an additional -1 or -5%. If the saving throw  is
an  unmodified  1,  then the character loses all  equilibrium  and
falls  to  the ground, helpless. Helpless characters get a  saving
throw vs. death every round thereafter. If the save is made,  then
the  character  can function again, but using the "-15%"  category
for penalties.
      Once  every 5 rounds, the character gets a saving throw  vs.
death to see how he or she is doing. Use this new saving throw  to
determine the penalties for the next 5 rounds. Characters that are
helpless  get to save every round until able to stand, then  begin
making a saving throw once every 5 rounds.

Power Score:  All penalties are increased by -1, or -5%.

20:  The psionicist is affected by this power until he or she gets
a 19 or 20 on the save versus death.

The  creature  may  attempt a normal saving throw versus spell  against  this
spell 50% of the time each round. In other words, there's a 50-50 chance  the
creature may attempt a saving throw (if so desired - this spell could benefit
the  creature)  each  round.  Magic  resistance,  wild  magic  immunities  or
resistances,  or  other surge protections (such as chaos  shield)  negate  or
resist  the  spell for that creature for the duration of this spell  (if  the
necessary checks are successful).

The material component of this spell is a silver piece.
An example: if Erelas, the 10th-level wizard, casts this spell in the heat of
combat,  every creature within a 40-foot radius sphere flips a coin.  If  the
coin  lands heads, the creature may make a saving throw to negate the effects
of  this  spell for the first round. Every round a creature is  in  the  area
effect  (including the caster), a coin is flipped for that creature  (if  the
creature  so  wishes  -  if  it opts not to make  the  saving  throw,  it  is
automatically affected by this spell). If the coin lands tails, the  creature
is  not entitled to a saving throw, and is affected by this spell as per  the
table below. If the coin is heads, the creature makes a saving throw. If  the
saving  throw is failed, or if the creature declines the right  to  a  saving
throw,  or  if  no saving throw is permitted, then every time  that  creature
needs  to  make  any other saving throws of any kind during that  round,  the
creature  must first roll 1d20 and consults the table below to  see  how  his
saving throw is affected.
Instead  of flipping each round, the first flip may be used to determine  the
resulting  effects for the duration of the spell. For instance, if  the  flip
lands  tails,  the  creature is absolutely affected by  this  spell  for  its
duration.  If it lands heads, the creature may save against this spell  every
round  for  the spell's duration. This will greatly simplify the  accounting,
and reduce the number of flips required for the battle.
If  a  creature leaves the area effect, the creature is no longer  under  the
influence  of  this  spell. If a creature enters the area effect  during  the
duration of the spell, that creature is then subjected to the flips and rolls
mentioned  above, again if so desired. If a creature not originally  affected
by  the spell enters the active area effect, that creature is subject to  the
spell as per the example above.
Any  creature with magic resistance makes the check only once, when the spell
is  first cast. Any creature not in the area effect, but who later enters the
sphere,  may  make  a  magic resistance check. If a magic resistant  creature
leaves the area effect and re-enters it, it is up to the DM to decide if  the
creature gets another magic resistance check or not, regardless of whether it
made  the  first one (the author suggests the creature would not,  since  the
creature  has  already demonstrated its resistance to this particular  spell,
positive or negative).
Example  continued:  there's a dragon (or part of one  anyway)  in  the  area
effect  when  Erelas  casts  this  spell. The  dragon  first  makes  a  magic
resistance  check. It fails. It then flips a coin. The coin lands  heads,  so
the  dragon may make a saving throw. The dragon makes its saving throw.  That
same  round,  shortly after Erelas's spell goes off, another wizard  casts  a
lightning  bolt  at the dragon. The dragon makes a completely  normal  saving
throw versus that spell, as it is not affected by Erelas's spell this round.
The  next round, before any other actions, the dragon again flips a coin.  It
again lands heads. The dragon rolls a saving throw, but fails. Erelas casts a
fireball at the dragon. The dragon rolls his magic resistance, and fails. The
dragon  rolls 1d20, and consults the table. He rolls a 7. The table indicates
the  modifier, at Erelas' level of 10, to be -3. The dragon then again  rolls
1d20  for a saving throw. He rolls a 12. This would normally make it for this
particular dragon, but the -3 penalty applies for this roll, which brings  it
down to 9. He thus fails, taking full damage from the fireball.
On the third round, the dragon flips a coin. The coin lands tails, indicating
that  the  dragon may not make a saving throw this time. Someone casts  charm
monster  on him, he rolls his magic resistance, and fails. He rolls a  15  on
1d20, and consults the table: +3. He rolls a saving throw: 9. The modifier is
applied, bringing that 9 to 12, which is enough for the dragon to save, so he
is not charmed.
On  the  fourth round, the dragon flips a coin, which lands heads. The dragon
makes  a normal saving throw (no chart check needed, as this throw is against
the  spell  itself), and succeeds, thus not having to worry about this  spell
this round.

When  this  spell  is  cast  on blank parchment,  meaningless  lettering  and
punctuation appear on each page of the parchment at the rate of one page  per
round.  The  lettering  may  resemble (1) that of several  random  or  chosen
languages  (at  least three) in the handwriting of the material  source  (see
below under material components), or (2) it may resemble no language at all.
If  the writing is viewed with true seeing, a glass of deciphering, or  other
similar means of divination, one of the following occurs:
      1.   If the lettering was that of random languages (chosen or not), the
viewer sees the lettering all as one language, but still meaningless.
      2.    If  the  lettering is purely random, the viewer sees new,  purely
random lettering, which is still meaningless.
If  the spell is cast on parchment already containing writing, the effect  is
neither  permanent, nor defacing, but does produce the same effects as  above
for 1 round per level.
Material components: enough ink wells to complete the job as if it was  being
performed  manually  (i.e.: one well per 5 pages or  so  -  DM's  or  factual
discretion), and a quill pen. The ink is consumed as the letters appear (thus
if  the  spell is dispelled prior to completion, the remaining unused ink  is
not  consumed).  The effect of (1) requires a sample of the languages  to  be
used.  For  best  performance, the full alphabet of each language  should  be
scribed  on  a  page of parchment (or several pages, depending  on  how  many
languages  you  wish to use, and how big your writing style is).  Effect  (1)
shall  produce handwriting matching the sample writing. Effect  (2)  produces
completely   alien   writing.  Perhaps  hieroglyphics,  perhaps   pictographs
resembling  oriental  characters, perhaps an actual  character  from  a  real
language - or close to it, or perhaps a simple scribble.

This  spell returns a disrupted or killed god back into existence;  in  other
words a "divine resurrection".
Any  god that has previously existed may be brought back with this spell.  No
matter how a god has been killed, the spell has a chance of returning him  to
form  and  consciousness. It is important to note, however, that  this  spell
will  not retrieve a god that is being held or exiled, nor will create a  god
that never actually existed in the history of the character's realm.
The base chance of success is 100%, but this is modified as follows:

Recipient was a demi-god -25%
Recipient was a minor god     -15%
Recipient was a major god     +0%
For every 100 years since death    -1%
Recipient was slain by hero   +0%
Recipient was slain by lesser god  +0%
Recipient was slain by peer god    -10%
Recipient was slain by greater god -20%
Recipient was slain by head of pantheon -50%
Slayer still exists -25%

Regardless  of  the  god's  previous power, if the  spell  works,  the  newly
resurrected god's "soul" will need to rest within the second component for  a
number of days equalling the number of years since death. Once this time  has
elapsed,  the gem will shatter, and the reborn god will have power  equalling
that  of  a  demi-god, regardless of previous status. If the gem is shattered
before  the resting time has elapsed, the wizard who cast the spell is sucked
into the void, without a saving throw.

The material components for the spell are an object made of cold iron, shaped
into  the  holy symbol of the dead god; a star ruby of at least 5,000  gp  in
value;  and  a piece of physical remains of either a priest, a temple,  or  a
sanctuary of the god to be aided.

When this spell is cast, the creature touched is moved bodily to the ethereal
plane  with all of its (non-living) equipment subject to a maximum weight  of
250 pounds plus 250 pounds per level of the wizard beyond tenth. The creature
may  then  move  from the ethereal plane to any adjacent  plane  (the  prime,
positive,  or  negative  material plane, or the elemental  or  para-elemental
plane).  An anti-magic shell won't disrupt etherealness, provided  that  this
spell  is cast prior to the anti-magic shell. If the wizard casts this  spell
upon himself, he may include his familiar in the weight limit.

The  priest can take himself and others into the border ethereal. From  there
the  travellers  are  on their own (DMs, you may want  to  read  the  Dungeon
Master's  Guide or the Manual of the Planes). The reverse, solidify creature,
can  force  a creature out of the border ethereal into your plane. Naturally,
this  spell  fails if the ethereal plane is not reachable. Anyone touched  by
the  priest, as long as he is within the area of effect (see above), is  also
drawn into the border ethereal. Unwilling victims are allowed a saving throw.

This spell cures 2d8+1 HP. The recipient must drink 1 gallon of water blessed
by  the priest. Then he is cured, but his water requirements for the day  are
quadrupled  (cumulative). Thus, a human cured three times  in  a  single  day
would  require 12 gallons of water. Failure to meet the water requirement  is
treated according to standard dehydration rules.

character  will swirl, untuck, unbutton, unclasp, twist, fold, chafe  or  any
other  action  that could disrupt the character's activity.  A  saving  throw
versus death magic negates the spell.
In  game  terms,  the target creature is at a -2 penalty on attack,  defense,
saving  throws and initiative. Spellcasting is not ruined by this spell,  but
all casting gets an initiative modifier of 2, since the caster must slow down
to avoid mistakes. Note that the target creature must be wearing some form of
clothing  for  the spell to be effective. The spell lasts for one  level  for
every two levels of the wizard casting the spell, up to a maximum duration of
10  rounds  (1  turn).  The  material component for  Euclarke's  cantankerous
clothing  is  a  small square of cloth, which must be twisted, stretched  and
pulled during the casting of the spell.

within  the  area effect to make a saving throw versus death  magic  or  fall
victim  to  Euclarke's offhand remark. The victims, should  they  fail  their
saving throw, suffer a highly unusual urge to perform all activities for  the
duration of the spell with their off hand. For example, right-handed fighters
will  use  their  left hand (with appropriate penalties)  and  a  left-handed
scribe will attempt to use his right hand to pen a scroll.
Spellcasters  under  the effect of Euclarke's offhand remark  suffer  similar
difficulties - any spell that requires somatic components gets an  initiative
modifier  equal  to  20  minus  the victim's Intelligence  to  cast,  but  is
otherwise unaffected.
To  effect the spell, the caster needs a small silvered mirror which must  be
polished  carefully with the caster's off hand. Ambidextrous  characters  are
not  affected  by this spell. Unfortunately, no ambidextrous wizard  can  use
this spell either.

This  spell  is  used  to  advance the target up the  evolutionary  scale  of
development,  whether real or imaginary. It can be only cast in a  laboratory
situation  where  the caster has no outside influences and  the  creature  is
confined or constrained.
The  spell  will  scan  the creature for any and all  aspects  which  can  be
described  as  a  product  of  evolution. This  includes  Strength,   Wisdom,
Constitution,  Dexterity,  organizational  habits,  activity   level,   diet,
alignment, natural Armour Class, movement speeds and forms, Hit Dice, natural
fighting  skills (THAC0, number of and attacks and the damage per  attack  in
game  terms), special attacks, special defences, magic resistance, size, grow
patterns  (for example, a frog begins as an egg, becomes a tadpole, polliwog,
and  finally a frog), and spellcasting ability. Also, the caster is  able  to
determine  what  intrinsic  capabilities could  be  improved  to  change  the
creature  through  an advancement of possible evolutionary development.  This
means  that  lizards  could become dragons (of a sort), ponies  could  become
horses, horses could become griffins, hippogriffs or pegasi.
The  casting  time is one round plus one round for every single  item  listed
above  which the wizard would like to discover (though DMs may want to expand
on  this). During this time no saving throw is allowed to avoid the  analysis
of  the creature in question, although, the creature must be held in relative
security so that the wizard will not be disturbed by any distractions  during
the  casting. An initial check against any magic resistance either avoids the
entire spell or allows it to function.
At  the end of the analysis the wizard may force the creature to move forward
upon   a   possible   evolutionary  scale  which  could  alter   or   develop
characteristics not previously owned. The possible changes are  immeasurable.
DMs  need to assure that changes are built upon a reasonable framework. While
giving  a  bird  the powers of a phoenix may be nice, unless the  wizard  has
prior specific knowledge of a phoenix's extraordinary powers (through use  of
this  spell's  analysis) he has no chance of duplicating the  abilities.  The
caster  is  able to alter 1 aspect for every 3 levels of experience possessed
at  a  rate  of  1  per  round. Any interruption  of  the  spell  during  the
alterations leaves the creature at the state it was in on the previous round.
The  creature  must make a successful saving throw versus spell  against  the
change  as it happens: each change requires a saving throw. Success versus  a
change  does  not  mean that the wizard cannot try the same change  the  next
round.
Using  the  bird  for an example, let's say that we have a  large  bird  that
normally fishes for its food by diving at the water for fish. Based upon  the
imaginary possibilities we could give the bird the ability to breath water or
flight  through water to make fishing a little easier. The wizard would  have
to  effect  two separate changes to achieve both effects. Now, if  we  had  a
human  subject that lives in a faerie woodland we could give him the  ability
to use aspects of other creatures in the woods. If we knew that the dryads in
the  woods had the ability to plant door we could even apply this ability  to
the  human in question. If we changed a horse into a pegasus, though,  simply
giving  it wings does not give it the ability to fly. That instinct  requires
another aspect slot to be used.
Changing a creature does not necessarily cause it to be charmed or enthralled
by  the  caster. Even if you turn it into a slobbering idiot or a genius  the
creature  will  not  automatically become loyal to the caster.  Although,  an
inventive  wizard  could make the creature fixated with a ritual  or  concept
which  would  make  the wizard the central aspect of the creature's  heritage
(such  as  a  totem or deity), thereby assuring the creature  is  predisposed
rather well to the wizard's commands.
This  spell  can also tell if a person has been the target of  the  7th-level
devolution spell or any other genetic retarding or decreasing spells. It  may
be used to specifically alter the effects, essentially returning the creature
to  a  normal state. Also, no ability score may be raised more than 2  points
above the previous racial maximum and never more than a score of 20.

The material component of this spell is a vial of aqua vitae (the essence  of
life),  which  can  only be made by a master alchemist.  Aqua  vitae  may  be
purchased  at the nominal price of 10,000 gp per vial due to its  rarity  and
usefulness in creating artificial life forms. Laboratory, for means  of  this
spell,  simply means a non-combat situation. The source of this spell is  the
Telnorne Mageocrat.

This  spell  causes fire to hurl itself at a victim for up to five  feet  per
point  lost  for a maximum of sixty feet. Upon contact with the  victim,  the
fire  does  1d4  points damage per level of the wizard minus range  loss  and
divided  by two if a saving throw versus spell is successful. Since the  fire
is  dragged  from a source (the material component), that fire is effectively
lost  from  the  source. Candles supply 1 point each, torches  can  supply  6
points,  flasks of lighted oil supply 12 points, and average sized fireplaces
or campfires supply 30 points.

This spell, when used, gives the wizard a great deal of information about the
immediate  area. The wizard receives the effects of the following  spells  or
spell-like  powers: detect charm, detect curse, detect enemies, detect  evil,
detect  good, detect illusion, detect invisibility, detect lie, detect magic,
detect  phase,  detect poison, detect psionics, detect secret  doors,  detect
snares and pits, and detect traps.
The  spell  remains  in effect constantly, and the wizard  receives  all  the
information  at  once. There is no problem with assimilating  the  data.  The
range of detection for this spell is 5 yards per level of the wizard.
With  the  appropriate  reversed spells, the wizard using  this  spell  could
become blind to some or all of the things that the spell detects for as  long
as  the spell would normally last. For example, the reverse of know alignment
cast  upon the wizard will cause him to be unable to detect evil or good.  In
some  instances,  it  will  become obvious to the wizard  that  some  of  the
detections are lost.
The  wizard  does not have to concentrate to use this spell, the  information
arrives immediately and the wizard knows instantly. The wizard can cast other
spells while this spell is in effect.
The  reverse  of  this spell, reduced awareness, causes one  creature  to  be
unable to detect, by any means, any of the above things for the magic of  the
spell  will render all attempts ineffective. There is no saving throw against
this effect.

The  material component of this spell is a miniature platinum telescope worth
at least 3,000 gp.

This  spell allows the wizard to enchant one or more coins with an  explosive
charge; the more valuable the coin, the more potent the explosion (see  table
below). The coins will retain their enchantment until used or dispelled;  the
explosion  will  be  triggered when the wizard utters a command  word  chosen
during  the  incantation. Alternately, the wizard may choose a  delay,  after
which  time the coin will explode; the length of this delay may be  up  to  1
turn  per  level of the wizard (measured from the time the wizard speaks  the
chosen command word).
The  following table gives the amount of damage for each type of coin,  along
with  the  burst radius, and what level is required to enchant  a  particular
type of coin:

     Type Damage    Level     Radius
     copper    1d3  5    2 feet
     silver    1d4  8    2 feet
     electrum  1d6  11   5 feet
     gold 1d8  14   5 feet
     platinum  1d10 16   10 feet

A  maximum of 10 coins may be enchanted per casting of this spell;  also,  no
more  than  20  of these coins may be brought within 30 feet  of  each  other
safely; if this occurs, each owner must make a saving throw versus spell  for
each  coin.  If a coin fails its throw, it explodes normally;  if  the  throw
succeeds,  the  coin simply vanishes in a puff of smoke. This spell  has  the
additional limitation that it may only be cast once per two day period.
The only material component for this spell is the coin to be e; the coins are
consumed in the explosion.

The  target of this spell comes under the eye of Set and will become sick and
slowly waste away. The target loses 1 point of Strength and Constitution  per
day and 1 HP per day. This cannot be healed. It stops when a remove curse  is
cast,  which  has 10% chance of curing per level of the caster while  a  heal
always  cures. After the remove curse or heal, lost hit points can be  healed
normally and lost Strength and Constitution points recover at a rate  of  one
per day. The material component for this spell is an eye of a creature killed
no longer than one hour before the spell is cast.

In  order to cast this spell, the wizard must have in his possession  an  eye
stalk  from  a  beholder. The stalk is pointed at the intended  victims,  and
after  the incantations are complete, one of 10 possible effects shoot  forth
from  the  eye stalk towards the targets. The exact result (including  saving
throws,  range, duration, etc.) are determined at random from  among  the  10
functions  of a beholder's eye stalks, as given in the Monstrous  Compendium.
The eleventh eye function (anti-magic ray) is never one of the spell results.
The only material component for this spell is the eye stalk, which is used up
when  the spell is cast. In order to achieve different effects, an eye  stalk
from  a  spectator, gauth, or an eye of the deep may be substituted  for  the
beholder's stalk.

This  metamagic spell enhances the effectiveness of all ray-type spells, such
as  ray  of enfeeblement, the cold ray version of Otiluke's freezing  sphere,
Sanh's  Ray spells, disintegrate, prismatic spray, etc. The spell causes  the
energies to radiate from the wizard's eyes instead of his hands (the spell is
split  into  two converging rays). This affords the wizard better control  of
the  spell,  as he hits what he sees. As a result, all saving throws  against
ray-type  spells are made at -4. If the wizard has only one eye,  the  saving
throws are at -3.
One  ray-type  spell  can be so affected per 4 levels  of  the  wizard.  When
casting  a ray spell, the wizard must declare whether or not the eyeray  will
be used. The spell is active until all its uses have been exhausted. Only one
casting of eyeray may be active at a time. The material component is one pair
of  gems  of the same colour as the wizard's eyes per 4 levels of the wizard,
and  a few of the wizard's eyelashes. The gems must be worth at least 100  gp
apiece.  If  the  wizard is missing an eye, only one  gem  per  4  levels  is
required.

This spell enchants the touched creature (possibly the caster) with abilities
similar to those of a beholder with respect to the eyes. By using this spell,
the  eyes of a creature (or the caster) can be enchanted with one spell  like
power  each. For most demihumans and humanoids this is two. The casting  time
is  one  turn  for  each  enchantment cast  plus  the  casting  time  of  the
enchantment. To cast this spell, the caster first casts eyes of the  beholder
and then casts the desired enchantment. The first spell captures the energies
of the second spell and those energies, which cannot be dispelled, flow in an
eye of the caster's choice. The creature affected can then cast that spell as
though  it were an innate ability. The DM rolls a 1d6 to determine the number
of days the spell lasts for each eye affected and keeps the result secret. As
long as the spell is in effect, eye colour generally changes to represent the
effect  of  the  enchantment.  For  every level  of  the  caster  beyond  the
enchantment  cast upon the eye, the spell remains in effect for another  day.
This spell has the potential to be very powerful especially if both eyes  are
enchanted  with  wish. In this case, DMs are advised to use this  spell  with
caution  and possibly reserve it as a psionic enchantment. On the plus  side,
the  material  components are difficult to get: one of an  actual  beholder's
eyes  is necessary to cast this spell. The DM may also rule that the eye must
have the same enchantment that the caster wishes to bestow.

With  this  spell, the caster causes his eyes to burn as bright as  the  sun.
Anybody  within  10 feet of the caster who meets his gaze  must  save  versus
breath  weapon  or become blind. As detailed in the Dungoen  Master's  Guide,
creatures  surprised  by  the  caster  automatically  meet  his  gaze.  Those
attempting  to  avoid the gaze by looking in the caster's  general  direction
without  looking  into his eyes risk a 20% chance each round of  accidentally
meeting  the  caster's gaze but suffer no combat penalties. Those  completely
averting  their  gaze or closing their eyes suffer the normal  penalties  for
fighting  blind ( 4 to attack; +4 to Armour Class; +2 to initiative).  Unlike
most  gaze  attacks,  looking into the caster's gaze in a reflecting  surface
(such as a mirror) has the same damaging effects as looking directly into his
eyes;  should the caster be tricked into meeting his own gaze,  he  too  must
roll  to  save  against blindness. Undead, and other creatures  sensitive  to
sunlight,  suffer automatic damage as if exposed to sunlight as long  as  the
caster gazes at them, and they are within 10 feet of the caster.
While  the  caster's eyes shine brightly, they produce no heat and cannot  be
used  to  light fires (unless using a magnifying glass); they can be used  to
light  a passage in the dark up to 10 feet before the caster. The spell  does
not  interfere with the caster's vision. Since this spell burns the  victim's
retina,  a cure blindness will not restore his sight; rather, stronger  magic
must be used, such as a restoration or wish.

When  cast, F.A.E. creates a large (25 feet long, 5 feet in diameter at base)
indestructible  missile from the wizard's concoction (described  later)  that
heads  to  its  target, better known as ground zero. The  missile  cannot  be
stopped  or  manipulated  naturally  or magically,  it  always  gets  to  its
destination  (of  course DMs may make exceptions to this rule).  Once  ground
zero  is  reached,  the  missile lightly disperses a  very  strong,  somewhat
gaseous,  magical  alcohol that is then ignited, causing immense  damage  and
complete loss of oxygen in the area of effect.
The  spell's range to ground zero is 1000 feet for every level of the caster.
This  allows an 18th-level wizard to centre the spell as much as three  miles
away.  This  would indicate that the wizard is well within enemy  borders  in
most  cases when the spell is cast, although he is still a distance from  his
target. The area of effect is a sphere with a 200-foot per level radius.  The
caster  cannot control the area of effect. Thus, if the wizard is 18th-level,
he  will always cast an F.A.E. that is 7200 feet in diameter. Given that 5280
feet comprise a mile, this is quite a distance. The wizard better be good  at
judging distance, or he might suddenly find himself inside the area of effect
of his own spell.
Damage  to  the  victims come by two means. The first is the  combustion  and
compression  of the explosion which does 10d10 points of damage. Victims  get
no  saving throw because the area of effect is too large and the explosion is
in  the  very air around the victim, rendering escape impossible. The  second
means of damage stems from the suffocation resulting from the explosion  that
uses up all the available oxygen in the area of effect. Every round beginning
the  round  the  spell is cast, 2d8 damage is taken from lack  of  oxygen.  A
victim  that has a chance to take a large breath of air and does not  perform
strenuous  exercise while holding his breath and is not fully encumbered  can
hold  his breath for a number of rounds equal to   his Constitution,  rounded
up  (non-strenuous  exercise  includes such activities  as  normal  movement,
searching  for  secret  doors,  etc.). If a victim  is  performing  strenuous
exercise,  the  number of rounds is cut in half (strenuous exercise  includes
combat,  attempting  to subdue or move an uncooperative creature,  trying  to
lift  heavy weight, moving at high speed, etc.). If a person does not have  a
chance  to  take a deep breath before the spell takes effect, the  amount  of
time  is halved (rounded up). This halving is cumulative with that caused  by
strenuous  exercise. Note that anybody can hold his breath for at  least  one
round.
When his breath runs out, a person does not immediately suffer the 2d8 points
of damage caused by lack of oxygen. Each round after his breath runs out, the
person  makes  a  Constitution check. The first check has no  modifiers,  but
there  is  a  -2  cumulative modifier each round thereafter. A  failed  check
indicates  that  the victim tries to inhale oxygen, which is not  there,  and
suffers  the 2d8 points of damage. He will continue to suffer 2d8  points  of
damage  each round until oxygen diffuses back into the area of effect,  until
he leaves the area of effect, or until he dies. After detonation of the spell
which rids the area of effect of oxygen, the oxygen will diffuse in at a rate
of 50 feet per round.

The  material components of this spell are usually rare, typically expensive,
and  quite  bulky.  During  casting,  the  following  ingredients  are  mixed
together:
           Ten gallons of pure alcohol are required. If there is any trace of
impurity before casting, the spell will backfire causing the wizard to be the
centre  of the area of effect. Many armies have foiled wizards by sending  an
assassin  to  place a foul liquid, such as skunk water, in the  alcohol  thus
causing the wizard and his comrades to be victims of their own spell.
           One  gallon  of  the  highly poisonous blood  of  a  Milwaukee  is
required. Many adventurers have died trying to kill a Milwaukee just  to  get
its blood.
          One gallon of holy water created by priests of Malus Temulentia (or
another appropriate god of the DM's choice).
          A pint of blood from a 9th-level priest of Ebrietas.
           All  alcohol  from a gland of an alcohol dragon is required.  This
material  component is difficult to get because the gland must be  filled  to
get  alcohol from it. Thus, if the alcohol dragon used its breath weapon, the
gland  would be empty. Only clever adventures can kill an alcohol  dragon  to
get  the  gland  without having the dragon use its breath weapon.  Note  that
capturing  the alcohol from the breath weapon won't work because the  alcohol
enters an impure state. The pure state of the alcohol can only be found in  a
gland.
After the ingredients are blended together, the following items must be added
to the concoction:
          One living boozeworm.
          A dash of salt and a squirt of lime.
          The ivory tusks of a pink elephant.
          The hide of the sinister Clydesdale breed, Pravus Clydesdale.
          The corpse of one giant alcohol black ant.
          One diamond that has a value no less than 1000 gp.

The  material components are perhaps the biggest problem with this spell, for
without  them  the  spell  cannot  be cast.  DMs  should  make  the  material
components hard to come by and adventures should be made just for that.  Only
very  rich people, like kings and other nobles, could afford to purchase some
of  the  more  exotic  material components. Thus a useful  partnership  takes
place: the ruler needs the wizard for the intense spell, the wizard needs the
ruler's  resources to collect the components. This spell is a closely guarded
secret by those that are fortunate to possess it. Using F.A.E. offensively is
great, but being on the receiving end of the spell is not to fun.
Is this spell too powerful?
18 is the minimum level the wizard must be to cast this 9th spell. Hopefully,
few  18th-level  wizards are roaming around. If a DM allows  a  character  to
reach  eighteenth level, one of two points can be assumed. Either the DM  has
been very careful to create game balance, in which case the DM will make this
spell very dangerous to cast (via collecting and keeping material components,
getting  safely  to the target area which is no doubt deep in  secured  enemy
territory, etc.), or the DM is an out-of-control Monty-Haulic, in which  case
it  doesn't  matter if the spell is to powerful; the argument  would  be  "Is
ninth level to high?".

This  spell  acts as a phylactery of faithfulness in that it will  alert  the
priest  to  any action or item which will adversely affect his alignment  and
standing  with  his  deity,  if a prior moment is taken  to  contemplate  the
action.  Furthermore, if the priest is forced by some form of  possession  or
domination  to act contrary to his alignment, the spell bestows a 10%  chance
per level of breaking free of the mind control, as well as a saving throw  to
not  carry out the offending act. The material component of this spell  is  a
drop of holy water.

Developed  by the evil mage Falerin while taking a trip through  limbo,  this
spell  is  not  evil  in and of itself. Similar to charm person,  this  spell
creates  a 10-yard cube, extending from the caster. All creatures within  the
area  of  effect that are equal to or exceeding the level of the caster  must
make  a  saving throw or be charmed. Creatures of lower level than the caster
may  also  make a saving throw, but at a -4 penalty. Creatures which normally
have  a  resistance to charm spells have no resistance to this spell, nor  do
any Wisdom bonuses apply.

This  spell  will  cause the recipient to think he is much stronger  than  he
actually  is. The recipient will fully believe this to be true, and no  words
to  the contrary will change this. The creature will act accordingly, such as
a  goblin runt, who will bravely rush in to kill a dragon singlehandedly. The
reverse of this spell, weakthoughts, will cause a powerful creature to  think
he  is weak and small, and to act irrationally. Such as a storm giant fearing
a newt.
Only a remove curse, cast by a higher level caster can cure this curse before
its  duration is up. A limited wish, or wish will also cure its effects.  The
material  component  for  this spell is a bull's eye  for  falsehood,  and  a
mouse's tail for the reverse.

By  casting  this  spell, the wizard conjures forth a huge ghostly  firestorm
encompassing an area equal to half a foot radius per level of the caster with
the  wizard at the centre of the storm. Thus an 18th wizard would be standing
at the centre of a firestorm 18 feet in diameter. The storm will do no damage
to  the wizard or to any other beings caught up in the area of effect. As the
spell builds power, the wizard and any others in the firestorm take on fiery,
ethereal  forms. When the full turn is up, all that remains  is  the  ghostly
firestorm,  with  slightly visible images of the wizard  and  his  companions
within.  At this time, the wizard can begin moving the firestorm at any  rate
up  to  24  yards  per turn. Corners and turns may be navigated,  streams  or
crevasses  crossed, there is almost no terrain that will hinder the firestorm
(DM's  choice if a special terrain). Those inside the firestorm may  see  all
that  goes  on  around  them while they travel and cannot  be  harmed.  Those
objects  or creatures in the path of the firestorm will fell simply a strong,
hot  wind  (although the firestorm is scary looking, it  does  no  damage  in
passing).  The wizard may cease the spell in anytime during the spell.  Those
within the sphere will re-materialise exactly in the position they were  when
the  spell  was  cast  (i.e.: same marching order,  same  items  drawn,  same
positions).  Although  they might go from travelling 24  yards  per  turn  to
standing still, those within the sphere will feel no forward momentum on  re-
entry. The wizard has 2 ways to stop this spell:
     1.   The wizard can simply pause its effects. All will materialize, with
the firestorm still active, and take some action (grab a chest of gold, check
their map, etc.). The wizard may then restart the spell (this again takes one
turn,  plus however long the characters' actions take away from the remaining
spell  duration). Once restarted, the firestorm is free to move  again  until
the  remaining  duration runs out. Note: no one can leave the radius  of  the
spell  while  materialized or they will be unable to reenter  their  ethereal
state.
      2.    The  wizard  can end the spell. If this is done,  all  characters
materialize  as  above, with the added bonus of the spells  remaining  energy
being  released within the area of effect at the rate of 2 points  of  damage
per  turn remaining. The wizard and others who materialize take none of  this
damage.  Example:  an  18th-level wizard and 3 companions  are  chasing  some
enemies,  they get into attack position, weapons drawn, and cast  the  spell.
After  flying  along for 8 turns, they spot the enemy and fly  directly  into
them,  and end the spell. The excess energy of 10 remaining turns is released
for 20 HP of damage in an 18-foot diameter. All the characters may now attack
and probably go first with the surprise factor).

      This  spell allows the target's sight to be increased up to five  times
(the  target  has  control over this, and can change it  during  the  spell's
duration).  The  spell can be cancelled at any time. While the  spell  is  in
effect,  the target cannot see anything close; after the spell is  cancelled,
the  target  is  disoriented for 1d4 rounds and has a  5%  chance  per  sight
multiplier  used  to  fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds unless  a  Constitution
check  is made. The material component for this spell is a small round  piece
of glass which is consumed in the casting.

This  spell  causes the recipients innards to become consumed  in  a  magical
fire.  The  victim suffers one point of damage per level of  the  caster.  In
addition,  if  the intended victim misses his saving throw roll,  he  becomes
racked with intense pain and falls to the ground for 1d4+1 rounds. The victim
of  the  spell is unable to function in any coherent manner during this  time
period.  Observers may notice a stench and see wisps of smoke  emerging  from
the  victims  orifices  during this period. After the effects  of  the  spell
expire, the victim may begin functioning coherently again, however, the  pain
does not completely subside for 24 hours (only role-playing effects).
The  spellcaster  has the option of directing more than one  "dose"  of  this
spell  at one victim (provided that the caster is of a sufficient level).  In
the  case  where  two doses are directed at one victim, he makes  his  saving
throw  roll  at -2 to the die, suffers +2 points of damage per level  of  the
caster,  and is incoherent for 1d6+1 rounds. This should be extrapolated  for
more than two doses. The material component is a bit of rotten food.

The  priestess initiates the spell by lifting her head, putting her hands  in
the air and screeching. This screeching causes all those in a 60-foot cube to
be  affected. Those affected must make a saving throw versus spell or flee in
terror  for  the  duration of the spell (those who have seen  or  heard  this
before  may save at +2). This spell will also draw any bats to the  priestess
in  a  1-mile  radius.  The  bats  will be  friendly  to  the  priestess  but
communication is not guaranteed. Those who are deaf are immune to this spell.

When  this  spell  is cast, it fills the followers of the priest's  god  with
bravery.  For the duration of the spell, all of the followers will be  immune
to  any  form  of fear. There is one material component required.  The  spell
requires  the  ritual slaying of a brave animal, such as a lion.  The  priest
then  drinks  the  blood of the animal and then blesses the  followers,  thus
transferring  the  trait of bravery to them. That material  component  causes
some  druids to be upset, so there might sometimes be some frictions  between
the religions that use this spell and the local sect of druids.

When  this spell is cast, a magical field surrounds the wizard and moves with
him.  This  field slows free-falling or free-flying objects as per  the  1st-
level feather fall, subject to a weight limit of 2000 gp weight plus 2000  gp
weight  per  level.  This spell will affect all missiles,  including  giants'
boulders, but weight beyond the maximum limit will not be affected.

Constitution  are  permanently  reduced  to  3.  The  victim's  intellect  is

      This  power  is  much  like  feel  light,  except  that  the
psionicist  can feel  any wavelength, and not just visible  light.
In  effect,  this gives the  psionicist infravision,  as  well  as
ultravision.  Ultravision  can show details  not  visible  through
normal sight (such as the patterns of some flowers).
      If  a  large  part of the psionicist's body is exposed,  the
psionicist  receives more light through his body, and can see much
better in dark  conditions. Thus twilight and a moonlit night seem
like a normal day, and a  starlit night looks like twilight. Total
darkness is still total darkness, but a condition which looks like
total  darkness  to  a normal human might look like  starlight  or
moonlight to the psionicist.

Power  Score:  The psionicist can see more light even if only  his
head is exposed.

20:   The psionicist suffers 1 point of damage per round for  1d10
rounds when exposed to light.

This  spell  is similar to the 1st-level burning hands, but it is  much  more
potent. When cast, this spell will emit an arc of flames from the hand of the
caster; the arc may be one of four sizes as listed on the following table:

     Arc  Range
     90   200 feet
     180  150 feet
     270  100 feet
     360  50 feet

The  arc  of  flames will have a width of one foot, centred on  the  caster's
hand,  so  the  height  of  the wizard's hand at the  time  of  casting  will
determine the height of the flames; thus if the flames are at waist level, it
is possible to escape the effects of this spell if lying prone.
The  caster may elect to cast the arc in a "doughnut" shape; that is, he  may
create an area around himself that is untouched by the flames (a good idea if
the  caster is in the midst of a friendly party). The radius of the hole  may
be  any  size the caster desires, up to half the range as given in the  table
above.
Anyone  hit  by the flames suffers 4d10 points of damage, plus  1  point  per
level  of  the  caster (to a maximum of 4d10+20); a successful  saving  throw
versus  spell  reduces the damage by half. If a victim fails a saving  throw,
all possessions must save versus magical fire or be consumed.
These  flames are blocked by obstacles, and they will not rejoin  behind  the
barrier. This will create gaps in the arc; therefore, if a target is standing
behind a large enough obstacle, he will be shielded from the flames, even  if
the blocking obstacle is tens of feet away.

The  material component for this spell is a chunk of volcanic rock and a  lit
candle; the rock is consumed with the casting, but the candle is not.

This spell creates a cone of fire that streaks from the wizard's hand towards
the targets; this cone is 2 feet wide at the point of origin, 25 feet wide at
the base, and 10 feet long for every level of the wizard, up to a maximum  of
200 feet. Anyone caught inside the cone suffers 4d8 points of damage, plus  1
point  per  level  of  the wizard (up to a maximum of 4d8+20);  a  successful
saving  throw  versus  spell reduces the damage by half. Combustible  objects
must save versus magical fire or be consumed.

The  material component for this spell is a handful of red dragon scales that
must  be  tossed in the air when the spell is cast; the scales  are  consumed
with the casting.

This  spell  is  similar to a wall of fire, but it creates a dome  of  flames
instead of a wall. The dome has a radius along the ground of 10 feet  plus  5
feet  per level of the caster; it is 25 feet high at its peak. The dome  must
be cast so its base is resting on solid ground.
Unlike  a wall of fire, the flame dome gives off waves of heat on all  sides;
anyone  within 10 feet of the dome suffers 2d6 points of damage, while  those
within  20  feet suffer 2d4 points of damage. In addition, the dome  inflicts
3d8  points  of  damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster on  anyone  who
passes through the dome (like a wall of fire, creatures subject to fire  will
suffer  more  damage at the DM's discretion, and undead always suffer  double
damage). The procedure for trapping creatures with the dome, as well  as  the
duration of the spell, are as per wall of fire.

The  material  components  for  this spell are specimens  of  phosphorus  and
sulphur, both of which are consumed with the casting.

     When this spell is cast, a thin bolt of searing flames shoots forth from
the  caster's index finger. This bolt will automatically hit a single  target
inflicting 1d10 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster, up to
a  maximum  of  1d10+10. A successful saving throw versus spell reduces  this
damage by half. If a saving throw is failed, possessions do not have to  make
a saving throw, unless they were targeted specifically by the spell, in which
case  the  owner  suffers no damage, but the object must save versus  magical
fire (at +2) or be destroyed (only one object may be targeted per casting).

This  spell creates a fog resembling that produced by a cloudkill; the  cloud
may  be  created up to 10 yards away, and moves 10 feet per round as directed
by  the  caster.  Strong winds will move the cloud in another direction,  but
will  not disperse it, nor will they move the cloud back towards the  caster.
Thick  vegetation will break up the cloud in 3 rounds. The fog itself is  not
harmful,  and has no other effect besides obscuring vision. During any  round
after  the  spell is cast, the caster may ignite the fog with a single  word.
When  this  is done, the entire fog cloud becomes a roaring sheet  of  flames
inflicting 5d10 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to
a  maximum  of  5d10+20)  to those caught inside. A successful  saving  throw
versus  spell reduces the damage by half. Those victims who fail their saving
throws  must roll for all their possessions versus magical fire; those  items
that fail their saving throws are destroyed.
If  any  type  of  fire  comes into contact with the fog  cloud,  it  ignites
immediately;  if  a  fireball or similar spell is cast into  the  cloud,  the
damage  inflicted is cumulative, and a saving throw for each effect  must  be
made  separately. The material components for this spell are several  strands
of  hair  from a cloud giant, and the scales of a red dragon; all  components
are consumed when the spell is cast.

When this spell is cast, a jet of flames shoots forth from the wizard's hand;
this  jet is 5 feet wide and has a length of up to 10 yards per level of  the
wizard  (the wizard may vary the length from 1 foot up to the maximum range).
The jet travels in a straight line and is blocked by normal obstacles (stone,
metal,  etc.).  If the jet is blocked, it will it will not rebound,  but  may
flow around the barrier if it is small enough (less than 5 feet across).
Anyone struck by the jet suffers 1d10 points of damage per two levels of  the
wizard  (up  to a maximum of 10d10). A successful saving throw  versus  spell
reduces  the  damage by one half. If this saving throw fails, all possessions
must save versus magical fire or be consumed.
The flames from this spell will melt ice and ignite wood on contact; they are
able to melt a hole in a wall of ice in a single round (though they will  not
destroy  it), and can bring down a wall of fog instantly; other  wall  spells
are not affected by this spell.
The jet will remain in effect for one round for every 5 levels of the wizard,
up  to  a maximum of 4 rounds. A single creature must be chosen as the target
for  the jet (but others may be struck if they are in the path of the flames)
and a new target may be selected each round the spell is in effect.
If  the wizard chooses, two jets (one from each hand) may be employed instead
of  one; if this is the case, range and damage are halved (in some cases, one
jet will do one more die of damage than the other). A separate target may  be
chosen for each of these jets each round they are in effect.
At the beginning of each round the spell is in effect, the wizard may split a
single jet in two, or may combine two jets into a single one.

The  material  components for this spell are a powdered ruby and  a  powdered
fire opal which must be worth a least 500 gp together. The powdered gems  are
mixed  together in the hand(s) of the wizard at the time of the casting;  all
material components are consumed with the casting.

This  is an improved version of Fellstar's flame arc; it is identical to that
spell, with the following exceptions:
The flames fall to the ground from the height at which they were cast, so  in
effect,  anyone at the initial height or below is affected by the flames.  In
addition,  if these flames are blocked by an obstacle, they will flow  around
the  barrier  and will rejoin at a distance equal to the width the  obstacle;
therefore,  if  the  flames are blocked by a 2 foot wide boulder,  they  will
rejoin  2  feet  behind  the rock. This applies in both  the  horizontal  and
vertical dimensions.
The  flames  from  this spell will continue to burn for one round  after  the
spell  is  cast;  anyone hit by the flames on the first round  suffers  10d10
points  of  damage, and those hit on the second round suffer 5d10  points  of
damage.  On either round, a successful saving throw versus spell reduces  the
damage by half (saving throws for the second round are at +2); if this saving
throw  fails, all possessions must save versus magical fire or be  destroyed.
Note  that  damage is cumulative if caught in the flames on both  rounds  the
spell is in effect.

The  material  components for this spell are as per those for the  flame  arc
spell, with the addition of one or more gems worth at least 500 gp. The  gems
and the volcanic rock are consumed when the spell is cast.

When  cast,  this  spell causes the wizard's hands to glow with  a  soft  red
light; if the wizard scores a hit in combat, his hand will discharge a  sheet
of  flames  that will engulf the target. The victim suffers damage  equal  to
1d10  HP  +  1  HP per level of the wizard (a successful saving throw  versus
spell  reduces  the  damage by one half). This spell may be  used  twice  per
casting (once for each hand); both charges must be used within 5 rounds  plus
1  round per two levels of the wizard; after this time, any remaining charges
are lost. Two attacks may not be made in the same round unless the wizard  is
normally capable of doing so; in this case, two separate to-hit rolls must be
made, and each suffers a -2 penalty.
The flames from this spell will ignite any combustible material; these flames
may be extinguished the following round, if no other action is taken.

This  spell  calls  into being a spinning vortex of flames that  resembles  a
burning  dust devil; the vortex is 8 feet high and 2 feet wide at its widest.
The  caster  may direct the movement of the vortex in any direction  desired,
but it may not be moved across a body of water. The vortex moves at a rate of
10  feet per round, and the caster must maintain full concentration in  order
to  direct its movements; if the caster loses concentration, the vortex  will
move in a straight line at full movement rate until the caster can again gain
concentration. The wizard may not move the vortex further away than 10  yards
per level of the caster, or the spell terminates.
The  caster  may use the vortex to attack a single victim per round;  he  may
attack  the same target in following rounds, or may elect to move the  vortex
to  attack a different one. Anyone struck by the vortex suffers 1d4 points of
damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4). A successful saving
throw  versus spell reduces this damage by half. The flames from  this  spell
will  ignite  flammable materials on contact, but will not  harm  most  other
materials,  unless exposure is prolonged. That is, if a creature is  attacked
by  the  vortex  for only a single round, non-flammable possessions  are  not
affected;  if attacked on two consecutive rounds, all possessions  must  save
versus magical fire normally (but only if the target fails his saving throw).
Each  additional  round of exposure inflicts a -1 on all possessions'  saving
throws (no penalty in added to the target's saving throw).

The  material  component  for  this spell is a piece  of  flammable  material
suspended from a string; the caster lights the material on fire and twirls it
in  a  circle while casting the spell. He must continue doing this throughout
the  duration of the spell, and the material must remain lit; if it does not,
the spell ends prematurely.

This  spell will cause an area of water to instantly burst into flames as  if
covered with oil and set alight. The centre of the area of effect may  be  as
far  away  as  10 yards per level of the ; the area of burning  water  has  a
radius  of 10 feet per level of the caster, but may be smaller if the  caster
desires.  The spell must be cast on an open body of water, such  as  a  lake,
river, or ocean; it may not be cast at a container of water on the person  of
an individual.
If the centre of the area of effect is on the surface, the flames will remain
only on the surface; if the spell is cast underwater, the flames will form  a
sphere  (if  the distance between the surface and the centre of the  area  of
effect  is  less  than  10  feet per level of the  caster,  the  flames  will
obviously  not form a perfect sphere; in this case, the surface of the  water
will burn as well).
The  fire  will last 2 rounds per level of the caster, or until extinguished;
the  flames  cannot be doused with water, as this added water  will  burn  as
well. The fire must be extinguished by magical means (i.e., dispelled or  via
a fire quench or similar magic), or be allowed to expire. If cast underwater,
the duration of this spell is halved.
The  flames from this fire are sufficient enough to start ships on fire,  and
any  creature caught in the area of effect suffers 3d6 points of damage, plus
1 point per level of the caster (to a maximum of 3d6+20). A successful saving
throw  versus  spell reduces the damage by half. If this  spell  is  used  to
attack  a  water  elemental or similar creature, the damage is  doubled,  and
there is a -4 penalty to the saving throw.

The  material components for this spell is a vial filled with a water and oil
mixture.

This  spell is an enhanced version of the 2nd-level spectral hand; it differs
from  that  spell  in the following ways: it can be used to deliver  a  touch
spell  of  any level and it gives a +3 to the attack roll. It has  an  Armour
Class  of  -4,  but  it cannot be destroyed by any attack  (it  may  only  be
dispelled). Instead, any hit on the hand inflicts full damage on  the  wizard
(although  a  successful  saving throw versus spell reduces  this  damage  by
half).  The  wizard  may  end  the spell with a  single  word.  The  material
component for this spell is a glove.

      By  use of this spell an apprentice can convert the contents of a grape
into  fermented wine. It will not change the skin of the grape,  so  it  will
keep  its  shape. This spell is mostly used by apprentices tired of the  same
old  food from teachers who do not approve of alcohol, but it could  also  be
good in an emergency for use against alcohol-sensitive monsters.

This  spell  enables the caster to increase the fertility of the target.  The
target  may  be  either male or female. The fertility of a character  may  be
calculated as follows (as per The Carnal Knowledge Guide). A target's  normal
fertility equals the base chance plus constitution modifier, determined  from
the  table  below. If both participants are "fertile" at time of  copulation,
pregnancy results.

     Race Base Chance    Constitution   Modifier
     Dwarf     22%  01 03      6%
     Elf  13%  04 06      4%
     Gnome     20%  07 09      2%
     Half-Elf  54%  10 12     +2%
     Halfling  50%  13 15     +4%
     Human     77%  16 18     +6%

Successful casting of this spell increases a character's fertility  by  5d6%.
In addition, there is a probability, equal to the level of the caster (1% per
level), that successful conception will result in multiple births (roll 1d20:
1  17 twins, 18 19 triplets, 20 quadruplets). Multiple castings of this spell
on  the  same  individual (while the first is still in effect)  automatically
fail,  as  does casting on a pregnant person. This effect lasts  through  the
target's  next  copulation;  thereafter, the target's  fertility  returns  to
normal.  Fertility can also be countered magically by spells such  as  dispel
magic, infertility, or wish.
The  reverse  of  this spell, infertility, destroys the target's  ovaries  or
testes, and automatically results in a failed attempt at conception (assuming
that  the  target  did not save versus spells). The target remains  infertile
until a successful dispel magic is cast upon him or her, followed immediately
by  a  regenerate  (the  former dispels the magic,  the  latter  repairs  the
physical damage).
Note:  fertility cannot counter the effects of infertility, but if the target
is  already under the effect of the former, he or she receives a +1 bonus  to
save.
This  spell  and its reverse may also be cast upon animals (eg., on  horses).
The DM should adjudicate the animal's initial fertility based on type, breed,
and quality of animal.
The  spell  can affect up to one creature for every 3 levels of  the  caster,
unless  the  priest  worships  a  god  of  fertility,  creation,  death,   or
destruction,  in  which case the priest can affect one  creature  per  level.
Priests  who  worship  fertility or creation gods  cannot  cast  infertility.
Priests who worship gods of death or destruction cannot cast fertility.
The material components for fertility are the caster's holy symbol and a seed
from  any plant (the seed is not damaged). The caster's holy symbol  and  the
ashes  from  a  handful  of seeds are required for  the  reverse  (the  ashes
disappear during the casting).

This spell allows the caster to control the action in a combat round. Fiction
takes effect the round following the casting.
Any  person  must reroll any rolls thave made during the round if the  caster
wishes  it.  The  roll could be anything: THAC0, damage, saving  throws,  and
ability  checks.  The caster can only have the person reroll something  once,
although he can affect all the rolls made that round.
In all cases, except in instances where the caster wants to reroll a personal
toss, the second roll is taken. If the caster wishes to reroll one of his own
tosses they pick which result they want.

The material component is a leaf that is showing its autumn colours.

Final  strike is the ultimate spell cast in a priest's career. The  spell  is
cast when the priest believes that he is facing imminent death. The object of
the  spell is to allow the priest to terminate his life quickly and  to  take
his  would-be  killers  to their graves as well. At the  culmination  of  the
powerful spell, the priest's body explodes with the power of his deity  doing
1d4 100 points of damage to all creatures within the area of effect. A saving
throw  versus  spell  results in half damage. Further, all  creatures  within
twice the area of effect are stunned for 3d6 rounds.
Structures within the area of effect take 10d6 in structural damage.  Smaller
objects  must  save  versus disintegration or be vaporised.  All  plant  life
within  the area is destroyed, and water or other liquids within the area  of
effect  are vaporised. Any creatures viewing the explosion at up to 10  times
the  area  of effect must save versus spell or be permanently blinded.  Those
making  their saving throw are blinded for 2d8 days. The bodies of all  those
killed  by the blast are disintegrated, as are all their possessions (magical
devices  save  versus disintegration). The body of the  priest  and  all  his
possessions are disintegrated, and the spirit of the priest moves on  to  its
final  reward. Neither raise dead, nor resurrection or any magic short  of  a
wish can ever bring the priest back to life.
The use of this spell calls the attention of the priest's deity. If the deity
looks  upon the priest's actions with favour, there is a 5% chance  that  the
god  will grant the priest maximum damage for a final strike. Ever after, the
ground in the area of effect is considered sanctified.
This  spell  is  the  maker of legends. Its use is never trivial  or  without
purpose,  and in fact, the spell will fail if the deity does not  approve  of
its  use.  But  no  deity ever considers the proper use of  this  spell  with
anything  but the utmost respect. Use of this spell in the service  of  one's
comrades is considered the highest form of valour, and use in the service  of
one's  deity  is  thought  of as the highest form of  worship  and  devotion.
Exceptional use of this spell has even raised priests to demigod status.

With  this  spell, a time spirit can locate the counterparts  in  other  time
streams, or future and past versions of companions, world leaders, and  other
individuals  he  either knows through detailed accounts  or  personally.  The
caster immediately knows if the being he is trying to find is dead, alive, or
if  it  even  existed in this reality. The character is  also  aware  of  the
subject's  general  location.  The use of this  spell  has  a  5%  chance  of
attracting the attention of time guardians.

The  remaining  end twists around to point in the direction  of  the  nearest
source of fresh water within the spell range. The branch can twist but twenty
degrees, and then the diviner will feel a tug in the direction of the  water.
The  diviner can specify a minimum amount of water to seek (greater than  the
amount  in  a  human body, for example). Also, he can restrict the  depth  at
which to seek the water.

By means of this spell, the caster surrounds his body with an aura of magical
green  fire. The fire aura extends 1 foot from the caster's body and provides
illumination in a 10-foot radius. It provides complete immunity to all  forms
of  fire,  both natural and magical; the flames can be extinguished  only  by
dispel  magic  or  a similar spell. Those touching the fire aura  suffer  2d4
points  of  damage;  additionally, if the touched victim fails  to  make  his
saving throw, his body is set afire with green flames.
The flames persist for 2d4 rounds. Each round the victim is engulfed in these
flames,  he  suffers an additional 1d6 points of damage; the victim's  attack
rolls  are  made with a -2 penalty during this time. The material  components
for this spell are a scrap of singed paper and a piece of flint.

This  spell  enables the caster to breath a cone of fire  in  the  dimensions
indicated. The fire does 1d10 damage per three levels of the wizard  (rounded
up),  with a saving throw allowed for half damage. The wizard has the  option
of  breathing  the fire immediately, or waiting for up to one round  per  two
levels. If the spell is discharged in a round other than the one it was  cast
in,  it has an initiative modifier of +3. If for some reason the spell is not
discharged before the spell expires, the fire explodes in the stomach of  the
wizard, inflicting 3d10 points of damage.

      This  spell,  when cast brings into being a protection field  one  foot
distant  frthe caster's body. When detonated, the spell produces a  burst  of
flame  around the caster's body, doing 1d4+1 points of flame damage for every
two  levels of the caster (cf. magic missile). The flame does not affect  the
caster, his items, or any creatures immune to fire. The spell is set off when
something  attempts to cover up, engulf, grapple, or other  wise  engage  the
caster in unarmed combat (eg., green slime falling on the caster). The  spell
is  not set off by weapon attacks, be they melee or ranged, nor is it set off
by  other  spells (although it can, of course, be dispelled or end up  in  an
anti-magic  shell  or the like). All damage from the fire burst  is  resolved
before  the grappling attack is made, and the target gets a saving throw  for
half damage. The material component is a pinch of sulphur.

This  spell  causes a beautiful, gossamer veil of multi-hued flame  to  dance
around  any  normal fire larger than a torch flame. All creatures  within  30
yards  of  the  fire  must save versus spell or become  transfixed  with  the
spectacle. While so charmed, creatures are subject to suggestions  of  twelve
or  fewer  words,  saving at -3 for suggestions of average reasonability  and
suffering  this second charm for a full 1d6 rounds per level of  wizard.  The
fire  charm and suggestions are broken by physical attack. The fire charm  is
also broken by obscurement of the dancing flame.

Similar  to  magic  missile, this spell produces one  missile  per  2  caster
levels,  rounded  up,  with  a maximum of 5. The  difference  is  that  these
missiles  are  made of flames; thus, they can be directed against  non-living
targets, and also set any flammable materials they hit on fire.

This spell turns the caster's eyes into small fire globes. All creatures that
meet the caster's gaze must save versus spell at  4 penalty or be charmed  as
per  the spell (but those immune to charm person are not immune to this spell
as well).
The  target creature must be intelligent and have the ability to see. If  the
saving  throw  is failed, the caster can try to direct some  or  all  of  its
actions during the spell. Otherwise the creature becomes immediately hostile.
To  determine  who  meets  the gaze of the caster, use  the  rules  for  gaze
attacks.
This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This  spell  requires an expensive gem. The value of the gem depends  on  the
number  of spell levels that will be cast into the gem. The gem's value  must
be 5000 gp per spell level of the spell or spells (cumulative).
This  spell causes a gem to have a flame appear at the centre. The flame  has
no  real  significance other than that the gem is ready  to  receive  spells.
After  a  spell is cast into a gem it can be called forth in one tenth  of  a
round.  The spell will act at the level it was cast into the gem. The gem  is
destroyed in the process.
A  spell that is going to be placed into a fire gem must be equal to or  less
than  the wizard's level divided by four, rounded down. An 18th-level  wizard
could  put up to a 4th-level spell into a fire gem. A 24th-level wizard could
put up to a 6th-level spell into a fire gem.
If  permanency is used on a fire gem, it will allow the spell to  be  cast  a
number of times per day. To determine how many times the spell or spells  can
be  cast,  divide the wizard's level by five times the level  of  the  spell,
i.e., a 1st-level spell cast into a fire gem at eighteenth level will be able
to  be  cast  18/5 or 3 times a day. If a conduit spell is added  before  the
permanency  it  will  double the effects of the spell  (if  appropriate)  and
double the number of uses per day.
Remember  that  a  permanency and a conduit spell are a  total  of  19  spell
levels. Therefore a conduit, permanency and magic missile would require a gem
costing  20x5000 = 100,000 gp gem. Also the wizard would be  unable  to  cast
spells for 20 days (due to the effects of the conduit).

Fire storm is an expanded version of fireball. The instant after the spell is
cast, a 60-foot radius sphere is filled with extremely hot flames. The flames
do 1d6+1 damage per level of the wizard, with a saving throw allowed for half
damage.

This is essentially the same fireball as in the Player's Handbook, but with a
slight change in the material component. Since bats are almost unknown in the
Arctic, this spell was developed using whale oil. Note that like the paper in
fire  aura (q.v.), the whale oil is a replacement worked into the spell,  not
an  optional  substitution. A wizard learning fireball from the plates  would
need a supply of whale oil, although perhaps another organically produced oil
could substitute. In the tropics, dolphin oil should work fairly well, say  -
10%  to -20% on range and -1d6 damage. At that point, the wizard simply needs
to  convince  the local sailors (preferably Greek) to go kill a few  dolphins
and  bring back their carcases. Spell research into even other components  is
of course also an option.

A  fireblast is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low  roar
and  delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who  cast  it  -
1d10 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up  to
a maximum of 10d10). Unlike fireball, fireblast creates a lot of pressure and
generally  tries to conform the shape of the area in which it occurs  to  its
shape. In essence, it creates a 20 foot radius crater. Besides causing damage
to  creatures,  the  fireblast  ignites combustible  materials,  forces  non-
combustible items to save versus crushing blow or be destr melts soft metals,
and  creates general havoc. If cast indoors or within range of a building  or
other structure, structural damage will most likely occur as dictated by  the
DM.  Fireblast  otherwise performs and is cast just like fireball,  with  the
additional material component of saltpetre.

This  spell creates a ring of fire which sweeps inwards until within  half  a
second  a lake of fire of radius 10 metres per level of the wizard is formed,
giving  a visual effect similar to the napalm bombing scenes from the Vietnam
War.  This lasts for a few seconds and does damage as the 3rd-level fireball,
but  without the damage limit. The material components for this spell are the
same as those for fireball.

This spell allows the priest to command any fish within range as long as  the
fish  can  hear  him and he does not exploit it. Only normal  fishes  can  be
affected,  including  variants in size. Thus catfish,  sharks,  etc.  can  be
commanded  but  dolphins (mammals) or mermaids cannot. The  command  must  be
given  in  a  short sentence of at most 25 words. The fish will automatically
understand  the  language  the priest is speaking. Since  familiars  are  not
considered to be normal animals, they cannot be commanded by this spell.  The
material component of this spell is a fish's fin.

This  creates a large fist composed of the chosen element of the caster.  The
type  of  element may be any one of the classic four (air, earth,  fire,  and
water) and is chosen at the moment of casting.
The  fist  attacks any creature the wizard wishes within the area of  effect.
Its  THAC0 is that of a fighter of the same level as the wizard. As  long  as
the  wizard is concentrating he may have the fist attack once every round for
as  many  rounds as he has levels. While concentrating he may not cast  other
spells  or  be  in  melee. It is up to the DM's discretion how  affected  the
wizard is by distractions such as arrows and similar such attacks thamiss.  A
suggestion  might be 5% per level of retaining concentration, with  modifiers
if, for example, the wizard was actually struck.
The  fist normally inflicts 2d10 points of damage plus a bonus (see the table
below),  except against creatures that are composed of the opposite  element,
on which they do 4d10 plus bonus (note that a fire-fist would still do normal
damage on a fire-based creature).

     Caster's  Damage
     Intelligence   Bonus
     1    -4
     2    -2
     3-5  -1

     22   +5
     23   +6
     24   +7
     25   +8

The fist has AC 0 plus a modifier equal to the caster's Dexterity adjustment,
and it has a total of 40 HP.

The  material component is a fairly large area of the appropriate element and
a platinum fist (100 gold) encrusted with gems (200 gold). The fist is fooled
by  illusions,  invisibility and displacement, for example, though  once  the
wizard  is  aware of the creature he may make it attack with the  appropriate
penalties.
For  example, a 12th-level wizard, Intelligence 16, Dexterity 15, could  cast
it  160  feet  away, attacking in a 36-foot radius sphere for 12 rounds.  The
fist attacking with THAC0 9, AC -1, doing 2d10+1 damage.

This  spell  extends the range of any other spell by up to 5  miles.  It  can

When  a  priest casts this spell, he causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire  to
spring  forth from his hand. This blade is actually wielded as if it  were  a
scimitar  (but it is not a scimitar), and if the priest scores  a  successful
hit  while  employing the blade, the creature struck will take 2d6 points  of
damage    with a damage bonus of +2 if the creature is especially  vulnerable
to  fire  (it will work especially well versus undead or ice para-elementals.
The  flame blade will ignite combustible materials. The blade will not affect
creatures  that  can  only be hit by magic weapons, except  with  respect  to
undead.  In  addition to mistletoe, the priest must have a leaf of  sumac  in
order to cast this spell.

This spell allows the caster to throw forth 1d4 bolts of red and white flame.
The  number of bolts is up to the caster. During the round the spell is cast,
the  wizard  can  do  nothing  else, and must concentrate  on  summoning  the
energies  necessary to cast the spell. The caster can throw  forth  one  bolt
every  round  after  the initial one until his bolts  are  used  up.  A  bolt
inflicts  2d10 damage to everyone in its path (no saving throw). It  explodes
when  the  wizard wills it to, when it collides with a solid object  (like  a
wall),  or when it reaches the edge of its range. If the caster used 1  bolt,
it  explodes  in a 40-foot radius and to 10d12 damage (save for half  on  all
explosions).  Two  bolts have a blast radius of 30 feet and  do  5d10  damage
each.  Three bolts: 20-foot radius and 5d6 damage. Four bolts: 10-foot radius
and  5d4 damage. The material components of this spell are a lit torch and  a
dragon's bone.

This spell temporarily grants the priest the fast talking proficiency: during
the  spell's  duration, the priest is able to talk and talk  and  talk,  thus
gaining  the  undivided  attention  of those  listening,  provided  they  can
understand  the priest. Note that all hearing the priest will be affected  by
this fast talking: party members are affected too.
The  second  use  of  this  spell is to increase  the  morale  of  hirelings,
followers  and henchmen: prior to a fight, the priest can encourage  them  by
talking  vividly for one round, thus increasing their morale  by  two  points
plus  one for every two levels above first, up to a maximum raise of 5. Thus,
a 5th- or 6th-level priest will increase the morale by 4 points.
The material component for both versions of the spell is a bit of phosphorus.

The  spell  is a combination of wraithform and wall of fire. It  changes  the
caster  into  a moving magical flame. It may be dispelled. In flameform,  the
caster  can pass through cracks. He cannot be hit by material weapons (except
those  of +1 enchantment or more) and he is not affected by magical or normal
fire  and vapours. Magical cold causes double damage though. Creatures within
10  feet  of a flameformed priest take 2d4 points of damage, while  creatures
touched  or  passed through take 2d6 + 1 per level of the caster.  Undead  or
creatures especially vulnerable to fire take double damage. No other physical
attacks  are possible when in flameform, except against creatures that  exist
in  the  ethereal  plane, where all attacks (both ways)  are  normal.  Spells
cannot be cast. Granted powers such as turn undead and gate fire do function.
The  material  components of this spell are a bit of gauze and  the  caster's
holy symbol.

This spell conjures up a small fire elemental: AC 5, 2+1 HD, MV 130 feet  per
round, one attack for 1d6, and it can be hit by normal weapons. It appears to
be  a  4  foot  high child caught on fire. It will move as  directed  by  the
priest, but if it is ever separated from the priest by more than 30 yards  it
will  instantly  dissipate.  Any being from  the  elemental  plane  of  fire,
including  another  flaming child, can destroy it with a touch.  The  flaming
child will ignite all flammable things it touches.
The material component for this spell is a bit of dung.

This  spell will bring into existence a huge flaming image of the holy symbol
of the priest. Any worshipper of the god whose symbol was used, receives a +2
to  damage  and  hit while it is possible to see the symbol.  The  worshipper
needs only to be able to see the symbol, he does not necessarily have to look
at  it. Any priest or worshipper of an opposing cult receives a  1 to-hit and
damage  while it is possible to see the symbol. The material component  is  a
holy symbol, which is lost in the casting.

      In casting this spell, the wizard must expose a body part (knee, thigh,
shoulder,  or something more sensitive, as the caster desires) and  call  out
something  appropriate. It will only affect members of the  opposite  sex  or
homosexuals.  It  will  cause all creatures affected to  be  stunned  by  the
incredible  attractiveness of the body part they have just seen  exposed.  If
the victim makes its saving throw, the duration of the spell is halved.

This spell causes a stunning burst of fire to explode around the victim. Such
is  the  suddenness  of this burst that any creature so struck  must  make  a
saving  throw  versus paralysation or be stunned for 2d6 rounds.  While  this
explosive shock is intense in the extreme, it is also confined so that others
even  within a couple of feet of the victim will receive no damage. All items
on  the person of (or being touched by) the victim must save versus spell  or
be destroyed.
The  individual graced by this spell receives 1d6 (counting all ones as twos)
points  of  damage per level of the wizard. There is no saving throw  against
the  fire  effects of this spell unless the creature struck is  resistant  to
fire.  In  this  instance, a saving throw for half damage is applicable.  The
material component of this spell is a jasper stone worth at least 50 gp.

This  enables  the  caster to imbue a flask with an illumination  spell.  The
first round of casting involves preparing the flask, the second round is  for
casting  the  illumination  spell  wished  for  into  the  flask.  Thus   the
illumination spell must have a casting time of one round or less. This  spell
may  only be cast on any given flask once; a second casting will result  only
in  causing the same effect as if a dispel magic had been cast on the  flask,
which  has  a  100%  chance  of  removing the  casters  current  or  previous
enchantments.  The material component is the flask into which  the  spell  is
cast.

Only one object can be stored at any time. Reduction in size of the body past

This spell creates an invisible barrier in a space desired by the caster.  It
cannot stand by itself - all edges of the flexible force field have to  touch
something solid, although if movement later would cause these edges to expand
or  contract,  the field will expand or contract to allow  for  this  to  its
maximum area of effect (further expansion will dispel the wall). The flexible
force  field can have a living being as part of an edge, but if so that being
gets a saving throw versus death magic, success indicating that the field  is
dispelled.  Failure means only that the being is an edge - it does  not  stop
that  being  from moving around, which could soon cause the collapse  of  the
spell.  A flexible force field will allow only the following to pass: gas  of
all  forms  (including air), creatures able to move under their own volition,
objects held or worn by these creatures, and light.
Note  that sound will also pass through the field, being transmitted by  air.
Hence,  animate  plants, animals, (virtually all) monsters, undead  and  even
insects  can move through the field, but water, dirt, molten magma  and  even
spells (except those mentioned below) cannot pass through unaided. A crossbow
bolt  would  stop  dead  upon hitting the flexible  force  field,  whereas  a
mosquito  would  fly  right through it. The field will generally  last  until
destroyed  by  a  force  that  could remove a  wall  of  force,  for  example
disintegrate,  limited wish, wish and the like, as well as by  stretching  it
too  far, as discussed above. Otherwise, it will last indefinitely. Note that
although  spells  cannot pass through the field, they  might  create  effects
which can. For example, shout or sunburst will be effective through the field
as  it transmits sound and light, and summoned creatures will be able to pass
through it.
The  exact shape of a flexible force field is not subject to the whims of the
caster  -  it will form so that the least area is needed to contact  all  the
outside surfaces - like a soap bubble. Being a form of pure magic, the  field
cannot  be coloured or painted to disguise its true form. However,  the  only
clue  of  its existence is a faint blue glimmer, which is only 40% detectable
unless  looking for it (in which case this rises to 80%, roll once per  round
for  each searcher). These percentages are halved if the flexible force field
is at the boundary of substance with a blue colour - for example, underwater,
separating an air pocket from the sea. The material component is at least 500
gp  worth  of powdered diamond (under standard Player's Handbook  or  Dungeon
Master's Guide prices - this could be less near a diamond mine, or more in  a
forest community, depending upon the DM). This dust must be sprinkled over at
least part of each surface that has to form as an edge for the flexible force
field.  For example, if this was a mouth of a tunnel then dumping  the  whole
lot  at  the  bottom  of the mouth would do, whereas the average  constructed
doorway  would need a dab on both sides as well as the top and bottom,  being
made up of four pieces of wood joined together.

      When  this  spell  is cast, the target creature or object  undergoes  a
momentary  flickering  or  blurring. This  flickering  is  not  automatically
noticed by observers and all creatures viewing the target must make a  saving
throw  versus  spell.  Those who make the saving throw  fail  to  notice  the
flicker  and  are  unaffected by the spell. Those  who  fail,  however,  must
immediately make an illusion disbelief roll with a +4 modifier.

     Those passing this second saving throw think that the target is probably
illusionary and will react accordingly. For example, those seeing  a  rolling
boulder flicker might not move out of the way, suffering full damage, or  may
ignore  the illusionary thief circling them for a backstab. While the flicker
itself  lasts  for but a moment, the belief that the target  is  an  illusion
persists,  until it behaves in a way that is evidentially non-illusory,  such
as  supporting  weight  or causing damage. This instantly  reveals  the  true
nature  of  the  target, but any damage done in this manner cannot  be  saved
against.

      The target of the flicker must be a creature or object which could  fit
in  a  30-foot  cube.  Thus  a castle or a great wyrm  dragon  could  not  be
flickered  while a small tower or an ogre could be affected. Any one  target,
up  to  the  area  of  effect restrictions, including (but  not  limited  to)
bonfires, pits, monsters, and walls can be affected. The spell cannot be used
to  affect purely magical effects such as a wall of force or spells  with  an
instantaneous  duration, such as fireball. It does work on  real  objects  or
creatures summoned or created by magic, however.

     Individuals that know or suspect that an illusionist is present, or have
recently  encountered illusion magic, suffer a -2 penalty  to  their  initial
saving throw versus the flicker. The material component for this spell  is  a
small lump of candle wax.

      This spell will cause the victim to get the flu, which will last 1d6  +
the level of the wizard in days. Flu is very contagious: anyone within 1 yard
of  the victim will also get the flu. With subsequent victims, the flu is  no
longer contagious, however. Flu reduces surprise by 5%, and combat attack and
defense  rolls  by 5% for the duration of the spell. The flu will  start  1d4
hours  after  the victim has failed his saving throw. The material  component
for this spell is a handkerchief.

Invented by the wizard Alcimer (and once known as Alcimer's flying fist,  ere
he died and his apprentices all made use of it), thisspell enables the caster
to  create  a "fist" of force. Forming at the end of the round in  which  the
spell  is cast, the hand is invisible to all but the caster. It can  move  12
yards per round, but cannot pass beyond 10 yards per level of the caster away
from  the  caster.  The fist can hover in mid-air, swoop,  swerve,  and  dart
through  openings as the caster directs, but it will disappear if the  caster
casts  another  spell  or is rendered unconscious. Physical  combat,  speech,
climbing,  movement,  and  other activities on the  caster's  part  will  not
destroy the fist. Although the fist can exist for one round per level of  the
caster,  it can perform only three things. It can grab falling, floating,  or
levitating objects of hand-size or less, any 10 gp weight or less  and  carry
them  about  for up to 2 rounds ere it drops them. Such objects  (keys,  ioun
stones, etc.) may be in the possession of another creature, but the fist does
not have the strength to tear weapons free of fastenings, material components
or  scrolls out of a being's grasp, etc. It can overcome magnetic pulls,  but
can  only  hold its own against a gust of wind or other severe  opposing  air
disturbance.  It  can push or slap a single creature sufficient  to  cause  a
missile attack to be at -1 to-hit, a catching attempt by the being to be  20%
more likely to fail than otherwise, and to delay (not ruin) spellcasting  for
one  round. It can also attack, striking as a blow (not a missile, and  hence
unstoppable by a shield or any protection from missiles magic), as though  it
was  the  caster  (but  at  +2 to-hit), and doing 1d2  points  of  damage.  A
successful punching attack by the fist ruins spellcasting during the round it
strikes. A flying fist can be readily dispelled by a dispel magic cast on the
fist  or  on  its  caster, and cannot penetrate walls  of  force,  anti-magic
shells, or more powerful magical barriers. It is AC 4 (AC 7 to opponents  who
can  see invisible as an ability or by means of temporary magic), and can  be
destroyed  by  any attack that deals it 5 or more points of  damage,  or  any
combination of attacks dealing it at least 5 hit points of damage in a single
round (cumulative damage does not apply to the fist).

This spell creates a vaguely human shaped pillar of fog. The fog phantom  can
do  no  damage,  but  it can be controlled remotely by the  wizard.  The  fog
phantom  moves  at 1 foot + 1 foot per level of the wizard.  The  wizard  can
"see"  and  "hear"  through  the fog phantom. This  spell  requires  complete
concentration:  disturbances will cause the termination of the  spell  before
the  end of its duration. The fog phantom cannot pass through cracks  or  the
like.  Strong  winds and intense heat or cold will cause the fog  phantom  to
disintegrate. The material component for this spell is some smoke.

This spell creates a creature much the same in appearance of that created  by
the 2nd-level fog phantom (q.v.). This creature however can do damage (one to
half the level of the wizard hit points of damage per successful hit). It has
a  THAC0  equal to that of the wizard, and a Strength equal to  the  wizard's
level.  The fog warrior has a -2 Armour Class and can be hit only by  weapons
with a magical +1 or greater. It has 10 hit points + 1 hit point per level of
the  wizard.  It cannot be dispelled by wind or fire, although fire  and  ice
will do damage to it. The material component of this spell is some smoke.

This  spell creates an area of heavy fog where the nightmares of the  victims
are  given  form  in much the same manner as shadow monsters  and  phantasmal
killers. The fog blocks all sight (as darkness) and infravision. It is  heavy
and  magical;  wind  does not move it and fire will  not  burn  it  away.  It
automatically extinguishes normal fires in the area.
Those in the fog must save versus spell or suffer feelings of dread and fear.
Any under these feelings suffers -2 to-hit and damage. As well, anyone trying
to  leave  the  fog  must save versus spell at -3 or become  disoriented  and
wander  around  for  another  round. There is a  75%  chance  on  each  round
(starting  on  the first) that a monster will attack a creature  in  the  fog
(rolled  individually for each creature). This monster is either a phantasmal
killer  (25%)  or  a shadow monster (Hit Dice equal to   the caster's  level,
rounded up; the caster can choose the form of the shadow monster). New shadow
monsters can be of different types.
Shadow  monsters  and  phantasmal killers will leave  the  fog,  but  no  new
monsters will attack the victims unless they reenter the fog.

      A  wizard  can cast fools prior to casting any other spell in  a  given
round;  it  costs  the caster a +1 to initiative. When the spell's  power  is
called  upon, it makes the next spell cast by the wizard appear to be another
spell. An example: a wizard casts fools followed by domination in a court  of
law.  Since  other  wizards  are  watching, he  makes  domination  look  like
comprehend languages. Only spell tell, or other dedicated divinatory  methods
(detect lie) can detect the use of the fools spell.

Force  blast  is  a  more  powerful version of force bolt.  If  used  against
creatures they take 6d10 damage, are knocked back 1d12 feet, and must make  a
Dexterity  check to remain standing. Any objects exposed to the  blast,  most
likely armour or a shield, must make a saving throw versus crushing blow.  If
used  against  inanimate objects, the object must make a saving throw  versus
crushing  blow at -4 or be destroyed. The blast has a Strength of 22  against
doors,  etc.  It acts as a double-strength battering ram against  structures.
The  material components of this spell are a pearl of at least 250 gp  value,
and a giant's tooth.

This  spell  causes  an  invisible bolt to launch forward  from  the  wizards
fingertip. The bolt does not explode on contact with whatever it is  directed
at,  but  rather burrows through almost any object (note that a +5 or  better
magic  armour  deflects it). The bolt has 10 hit points + 2  hit  points  per
level  of the wizard, these hit points being "burrowing points". For each  10
hit points of damage a normal magical item takes it will loose a plus.
A  normal  shield or splint mail or leather armour will use up 5 hit  points,
chain  mail  will  use up 7 hit points, and full plate will  use  up  10  hit
points. For some reason, ordinary elven chain will always cause this spell to
reflect  (magical elven chain does not have this effect unless it  is  +5  or
higher).  Items  do  get a saving throw, and once an item  makes  its  saving
throw,  the spell is lost. The material component for this spell is a bit  of
iron.

This  spell creates a magical shield of force around the wizard at  a  6-inch
radius, which absorbs damage at a rate of one point per round plus one  point
per two additional levels per round. The shield also protects the wizard from
biting  insects, foul weather, and poisonous gases. However,  the  wizard  is
unable  to  make physical contact with anything outside (but not  under)  the
shield  for the duration of the spell. The spell may be broken at  will.  The
shield  provides total invulnerability to magic missile, power bolt, word  of
power, magic darts, mystic bolt, and arcane bolt. The material component  for
this spell is a small shield.

This spell calls into existence a whip-like tendril of force which the wizard
grasps and uses to strike foes. The whip inflicts 2d6 HP of damage on a  hit.
The wizard's effective Strength when using the whip is dictated by his level.
Consult the following table for the wizard's effective Strength.

     Level     Strength  Level     Strength
     9    9    20   18/60
     10   10   21   18/90

     19   18/30     30   25

Beyond  thirtieth level, the spell has reached its maximum potential; neither
duration nor effective Strength increase. The wizard is treated as a  fighter
of  half his level when casting this spell, and the wizard may cast no  other
spells  while using the whip (though he may prematurely terminate the spell).
The material component is a whip made of braided gold and mithril fibre worth
at least 200 gp.

When  casting this spell, the metamage tries to make another wizard,  priest,
or  spell casting monster forget a single spell. The target must save  versus
spell  at  -5.  If  the saving throw is successful, nothing happens.  If  the
saving  throw fails, the target loses a random spell. The metamage  does  not
steal  the  spell; the spell is simply forgotten. The material  component  of
this spell is a bit of gum arabic.

The  caster and all his possessions shapechange into a giant beast when  this
spell  is cast. The caster can't cast any spells when in beastform,  but  can
end  the  spell at will. The spell will also end after 24 hours have  passed.
Each deity has its own beastform, with its own characteristics   according to
the  deity's symbol, portfolio, and history. As an example, an indication  of
how the giant beast form of Set could look like is given.

sort  of  attack  that causes physical damage is  either  lessened
and/or  the psionicist has greater resistance giving them a better
chance to shake off the effects of such an attack.
      Specifically, the power will first add a +2  to  all  saving
throws  against  attacks  that cause  physical  damage,  including
spells  like fireball, cone of cold, etc., poison, breath weapons,
and  attacks  from magic items like wands that produce  spell-like
effects.   Second, the psionicist can subtract one  from  the  all
damage  die rolled for an attack that produces physical damage  on
him/her  and  also reduce poison damage by 25%.  In addition,  the
psionicist  is immune to death from massive damage,  and  further,
spells  like  Finger  of  Death will not  take  effect  until  the
psionicist  stops  maintaining the power, then  if  the  save  was
failed,  the  psionicist dies.  Finally, if powers are  used  that
convert PSPs to raw pure energy that can be used to blast enemies,
this power halves the damage from such an attack since it is using
psionics to resist psionics.

Power  Score:   The saving throw bonus improves  to  +4,  and  all
damage die suffer a -2 penalty.  Further, poison damage is halved.

20:  The psionicist immediately suffers 20 hit points of damage no
save,  and further, all saving throws are penalized by -1 for  the
next 24 hours.

This  spell  grants the recipient the benefits of protection from  paralysis,
and  the additional benefits of being able to function without penalty  in  a
constricting environment (such as water, web spells, entangle spells,  etc.).
It does not affect paralysis already existing, unless it is cast specifically
to counter such in which case it gives no further benefit.

This  spell  enables  the recipient to move and attack  freely  and  normally
whether  attacked by entangle, web, hold, or slow spell, or when  underwater.
In  the  former  case, the spells have no effect, while in  the  latter,  the
recipient  can  combat normally with hand-held combat (not missile)  weapons.
The material component is a drop of oil or a dab of grease.
If  the recipient has a familiar, it is affected as well for the duration  of
the spell, so long as it remains in contact with its master.

This  spell  can be used to free one creature summoned from the inner  planes
from  the  control  of  its summoner. Typically, it  is  used  on  elementals
summoned  by a conjure elemental spell or device, but it also works  on  such
creatures as aerial servants and invisible stalkers. The spell is cast on the
sumcreature,  and  unless the wizard who summoned it  makes  a  saving  throw
versus  death  magic that creature is freed from control. The freed  creature
may  return to its own plane (25%) but usually turns on the summoner and  his
companions  (75%).  This spell has no effect on creatures from  the  ethereal
plane.

     This spell instantly freezes a quantity of water in any shape the wizard
desires.  If a living creature has any part of it inside the area of  effect,
it  can  make a saving throw versus paralysation (with a +4 bonus) to escape,
or be stuck in the ice. The ice is non-magical and can be affected normally.

This  spell  will put one creature in temporal stasis for 1d4+1 rounds.  This
special temporal stasis cannot be dispelled, but the affected creature cannot
be harmed, contacted or influenced for the duration of the spell.
The short, variable duration makes this more of an "escape from the bad guys"
spell  than  an  attack spell, but you can always pick up your  newly-created
statue  and  do interesting things to him - as long as this is done  quickly.
This  works  best  if  you  have  cliffs or volcanoes  nearby.  The  material
component for this spell, which was researched by Whitewolf, is an hourglass.

Sage's note: this is a great roleplaying vehicle for some players, if one  of
their  characters gets this spell cast on him (or her). It could be real  fun
having a pervert for a character.

      A person subject to this spell begins consciously and subconsciously to
interpret everything in sexual terms. For example, the subject would perceive
a sword attack not only as melee but also as an attempted rape by a male, and
would  experience  eating a taco as... well, you get the idea.  The  material
component is a magic wand, and the verbal component is a lewd innuendo.

      This  spell  allows  the caster to speak with  one  person  at  a  time
completely understandable by subvocalizing (whispering under your breath) the
message. Who she is talking to can be changed, as long as all of the  talking
takes place within the one-minute time limit.

      I recommend that DMs actually time the message to one minute. This will
eliminate  hassles about whether or not there is enough time or  not  to  say
something (like "the solution is...").

When  a priest casts this spell, he causes a freezing icicle to spring  forth
from  his hand. This blade is actually wielded as if it were a scimitar  (but
it  is  not  a  scimitar), and if the priest scores a  successful  hit  while
employing  the  blade,  the creature struck will take 2d6  points  of  damage
with  a damage bonus of +2 if the creature is especially vulnerable to  frost
(it  will  work  especially well versus red dragons or fire elementals).  The
blade  will  not affect creatures that can only be hit by magic  weapons.  In
addition to mistletoe, the priest must have a leaf of sumac in order to  cast
this spell.

This  spell allows the wizard to create a breath weapon similar to a cone  of
cold.  Once the dweomer is cast the wizard may breath up to twice per day  as
if  the breath weapon were an innate ability, causing no harm to himself. The
area  of  effect for the breath weapon is a cone area 20 feet  long  with  an
ending  base  of  15  feet.  The damage is 1d4+1  for  every  two  levels  of
experience  the  wizard possesses, up to a maximum of 5d4+5 at  tenth  level.
Attack creatures may save versus breath weapon for half damage. Any creature,
including the caster, cannot have more than one of this spell active  at  any
given time.

The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered marble blown into
the  wind when the spell is cast. The source of this spell is the Ranger/Mage
Aramor.

Supposedly  designed  by a wizard by the name of Rakmos  Shearlight  for  his
friend's  wool business, this spell causes fur or hair to grow  on  a  living
creature at a rate of 1 inch per round. It even affects creatures that do not
normally  have  fur or hair (eg., one could create fur on  an  alligator).  A
saving throw is allowed and those that successfully save will not be affected
by  the fur or hair growth. Otherwise, the fur or hair will continue for  the
duration  of  the spell. The fur or hair will remain, even after the  spell's
duration  expires, and it is not magical. A dispel magic will only  halt  the
fur  or hair growth. Partial areas of large creatures have been known  to  be
affected by this spell (the face of the red dragon Scorch, for example).
In  itself, this spell is relatively harmless. The effects on the other  hand
can  be quite interesting. Tight armour has been known to break and fall off,
the  fur  or hair could catch fire (since hair is highly flammable), the  fur
can  serve  as extra insulation in cold climate, instant fur is provided  for
the lightning bolt spell, etc.

The material component for this spell is a bit of fur.

Casting of this spell fills the priest with the fury of berserker rage. It is
favoured by many of the priesthoods of gods of war and battle. When cast,  it
raises the priest's Strength to 18/00 (thus giving him a +3 to-hit and  a  +6
to  damage),  and  it hastes the priest as 3rd-level wizard spell  (thus  the
priest  functions at double its normal movement and attack rates and gains  a
2  initiative bonus). While in this fury, the priest cannot cast any  spells,
for  he  is completely enveloped in this berserker rage and in the battle  at
hand.
There  are  two  drawbacks to this spell. One drawback  is  that  the  priest
receives  no  bonus  to  Armour  Class for  Dexterity,  he  even  suffers  an
additional penalty of 1 to his Armour Class. The priest is completely on  the
offensive,  defense is not in his vocabulary. The second and  more  dangerous
drawback  is the strain put upon the body of the priest. For every round  the
priest  remains  in the fury, he loses 1d4 HP from physical  strain  (muscles
tearing,  blood  vessels  popping, chemical  imbalance  caused  by  too  much
adrenaline).
The  duration of this spell is up to a maximum number of rounds equal to  the
priest's Constitution. If the priest goes down to 0 or less hit points during
the  fury, he will still remain conscious because of the fury created by this
spell.  But  if the priest maintains the fury to 0 or less hit  points,  then
when  the  priest  dispels the spell or the maximum duration  is  reached,  a
system  shock roll must be made or the priest dies instantly. If  the  system
shock  roll  is  made,  the priest is barely alive and  can  only  be  healed
magically.  The  physical strain has put the body beyond its  normal  healing
capacity. If the fury is released before the maximum duration and the  priest
is  still  above 0 HP, then the damage can be healed normally. This spell  is
normally only cast in dire circumstances or by fanatical priests of  war  and
battle.
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This  is  a variant of Melf's acid arrow. Unless otherwise noted, this  spell
mimics many of the properties of Melf's acid arrow (q.v.).
When this spell is cast, a small black sphere a few inches across appears  in
the wizard's hand. The wizard then proceeds to hurl this sphere at the target
of  the  spell. If it does not strike the target or is not thrown immediately
after its creation the sphere fades into nothingness.
If  it hits successfully, on the spot which the sphere struck appears a huge,
black,  shiny leech-like creature which bites into the target and  begins  to
drink the target's blood. This leech can even bite into creatures hit only by
+1  or  better  magical weapons. The creature cannot be removed  by  anything
short of a dispel magic or the wizard's own hand until it has had its fill of
the  target's  blood and is sated, at which time the creature  falls  to  the
ground. The number of rounds this takes and the damage inflicted due  to  the
blood drain are as per Melf's acid arrow.
The  creature's bite carries an anaesthesia which makes the target  oblivious
to its presence if it is struck by surprise. The target will, however, notice
that  it  is  growing progressively weaker and may make a Wisdom check  every
round to spot the creature.
As  previously  mentioned, when the creature is satiated (or  if  the  wizard
removes it before this occurs), it will fall from its target where it may  be
collected later by the wizard. The creature will survive for up to  one  hour
after being removed from the target during which time it retains its immunity
to  all  attacks save dispel magic and the wizard's hand. After one  hour  it
will dissolve into a small puddle of blood. Before the end of this hour,  the
wizard  may  force  the leech to dissolve itself at any time  or  alternately
bleed  it slowly if he has a dagger or similar weapon on hand (again, only  a
weapon  wielded  by the wizard will be effective against this creature).  The
blood  may be collected in whatever receptacle the wizard has available,  for
later use in poisons, potions, other spells, sympathetic magics, etc.
If the target of the leech is not a creature of flesh and blood that would be
harmed  by  the leech's blood drain, then the bite of the leech will  inflict
only 1d4 points of damage before the leech falls off the target.
Although it should be obvious, it is worthy of note that this spell does  not
damage  the target's items as it does not shower the target in acid  as  does
Melf's acid arrow. Also, note the shorter range of this spell.

The  material  component for this spell is a leech which  has  fed  upon  the
wizard's  own  blood and has afterwards been lanced with  a  hot  needle  and
killed.

This  spell allows the wizard to turn the creature touched into a pink  cloud
of  gas,  for  the  duration  of the spell. If the  creature  touched  is  an
unwilling  recipient of the spell, he gets a saving throw, with a  successful
saving throw negating the spell.
The spell's effects are identical to that of the potion of gaseous form, with
regards  to movement rates, and the effects of a gust of wind spell. However,
the  wizard - if he casts the spell on himself - can turn non-gaseous at  any
time.

This  spell  causes an individual, as well as the non-living items  which  it
carries  or  wears  up to 1000 gp weight per level of the wizard,  to  become
gaseous in form and able to flow accordingly at a base speed of 3 per  round,
subject  to  wind  conditions. The gaseous form cannot be  physically  harmed
except by magical fires or lightning, in which case damage is normal, but the
gaseous creature may be affected by mind-related attacks such as charm,  hold
or suggestion spells. However, a whirlwind causes double damage to a creature
in gaseous form.
The  spell  lasts  for the entire duration and can only  be  removed  by  the
reverse of the spell. During this period, the creature can see and hear,  but
no  magic items or spells may be used. Psionics (except for body weaponry and
shape  alteration) will function normally, and psionic combat can take place.
Spells  cast  on the creature prior to this spell will remain in  effect  for
their normal durations (resist fire, protection from lightning, etc.).
The  reverse,  solidify form, allows the gaseous creature  touched  a  saving
throw versus death magic. If the creature touched fails the saving throw, the
creature  immediately resumes solid corporeal form and cannot resume  gaseous
form for the duration of the spell.
If the wizard casts this spell on himself, he may include his own familiar in
the  area of effect. If this spell, or its reverse, is cast on an unconscious
or dead creature, it is allowed no saving throw.

The material component for gaseous form is a mouthful of smoke; the component
for solidify form is a mouthful of rock.
Note:  this  spell  was researched by the mage Paul, also  known  as  Purple.
Gaseous  form  was  specifically  invented for  battling  vampires  with  its
reverse. Dimension door is a much better escape spell, and invisibility is  a
much better infiltration spell, but this one is fun to spring on new DMs.

This  spell is similar to the 7th-level gate lesser fiend, save that  as  the
power  of the fiends being gated goes up, so do the price and the risks.  Any
fiend  gated in with this spell may save versus spell (with a -2 penalty)  to
be free willed. Magic resistance is of no benefit. However, even a controlled
fiend will not automatically follow the commands of the wizard. All "control"
means  is that the fiend will not attack. Also, a free willed fiend will  not
always attack if the wizard acts swiftly (of course, sometimes they will...).
This spell summons a single fiend, to whom the wizard makes an offer. If  the
fiend  accepts,  it  performs a task, which is often just  fighting  for  the
wizard.  This offer is included in the casting time of the spell.  After  one
round  of  casting,  the fiend is on the prime material  plane,  and  if  the
concentration  of  the wizard is broken the fiend becomes  free  willed.  The
nature of the offer varies with each summoning, but it typically includes the
chance  to  kill  sentient creatures, and payment in the  form  of  magic  or
treasure  (gold and gems being the most common). Exactly how much  should  be
offered  is usually only found out by consulting sages, old tomes, or wizards
that  use  this spell often (of which there remain very few). A quick  wizard
will increase the reward to a free willed fiend. As with the lesser spell,  a
fiend  that does not kill a sentient creature will be free willed at the  end
of  the  spell, with the option of staying on the plane for an additional  10
turns,  having a lot of enmity towards the wizard. With fiends that  are  not
free willed, the wizard can dismiss them at any time, returning them to their
own plane.
This  spell  can  be used to summon the following types of  fiends:  abishai,
barbazu,  erinyes, hamatula, osyluth, farastu, alu-fiends  (no  genii),  bar-
lgura,  cambions  (either barons or major ones, no mages), and  succubi.  The
more  powerful  the fiend, the higher the price. The more intelligent  fiends
(erinyes, some alu-fiends and cambions, succubi) might demand as their  price
some  service from the wizard. The nature of the service will always be evil,
and the goal of the fiend is to entice the wizard into further summonings and
greater  evils so that eventually the fiends (of that particular  type)  will
control  the  wizard. If a deal cannot be reached, the fiend  is  immediately
returned to its home plane.

The  material component for this spell is a holy symbol from any  good  faith
(minimum value 1500 gp; it must have been made by that faith) which is broken
as the spell is cast.

This  is  the first of a series of risky spells developed to try and  harness
the  power  of  the  fiends of the lower outer planes. Obviously,  any  spell
dealing  with  these  evil creatures entails a good  deal  of  risk  and  the
potential  for  controlling a lot of power. With this spell, the  wizard  can
gate  in  a  number of lower-powered fiends. These fiends get a saving  throw
(with a -2 penalty). Magic resistance is not effective against this spell. If
the saving throw is successful, then they are free willed and will attack the
wizard and his allies. If the saving throw is failed, then they will obey the
wizard. However, before the spell is ended, the fiends must kill one creature
each,  or  they  will remain behind at the end of the spell's  duration,  and
become  free willed. Fiends with an average or higher intelligence  or  5  or
more Hit Dice must kill an intelligent humanoid creature (human, demihuman or
human-sized  goblinoid). If the wizard attacks the fiends, they automatically
become  free  willed.  Fiends  always can defend themselves  against  attack.
Because  this  is  a gate, not a summoning, dispel magic will  not  send  the
fiends  back where they came from; a dismissal or similar spell is  required.
Gated-in  fiends  cannot use their gating abilities. They can  perform  tasks
other  than  fighting  if the wizard requests this. The  following  types  of
fiends  can be gated in with this spell: 3d10 lemure (they collectively  only
need  to  kill  one creature to avoid becoming free willed),  3d12  nupperibo
(they  too  only collectively need to kill one creature), 2d6 spinagon,  3d10
manes  (they  collectively need to kill one creature),  1d6  rutterkin.  Free
willed fiends are automatically expelled from the prime material plane  after
10  turns. Casting this spell is an evil act, and will result in a change  of
alignment for good or neutral wizards.

The  material component for this spell is a holy symbol from any  good  faith
(minimum value 500 gp; it must have been made by that faith) which is  broken
as the spell is cast.

      This spell allows the wizard to read anything which is stored within  a
single  gem by another spell called gem write or gem store. This spell allows
the  character access to one gem per 3 levels. The gems have to be determined
during  casting. This spell may be made permanent with a permanency. In  that
case, all gems which contain information or other material may be accessed.

The material component is a single gem worth at least 100 gp per level of the
caster.  This  gem has to cut exactly in half, hollowed out and  then  to  be
filled  with a single drop of blood from the caster per gem which  is  to  be
accessed (up to the maximum of one per three levels).

This  spell is similar to Item Protector, but it works only for gems  of  any
kind.  It  is a little higher powered for its specific purposes. It  protects
the gem it is cast upon from two failed saving throws per caster level. These
saving  throws may be of any kind. If the effect normally does  not  allow  a
saving throw, this spell still protects from the damage done by the effect  -
at  the cost of five saving throws per such effect. This spell may be layered
up to 10 saving throws per caster level from the same caster. Once all saving
throws are gone, this spell ends.

The  material component is a gem of the same kind, worth the same amount, and
the  same  colour.  This gem then has to be encased in  adamantine,  then  in
hizagkuur metal and last in a case of gold from smelted holy symbols. All  of
these components vanish in casting.

This spell causes unliving, non-undead, non-animated material of any kind  to
be  reduced  in size and to be transported into a gem. No material  with  any
intelligence nor any kind of animating or life force may be contained  within
the  gem. Any material can be stored at any time that the wizard has the  gem
in  hand  (the gem must still have the required capacity) and the wizard  has
read gem active. If all these requirements are met, the wizard may add to  or
take from the gem anything he desires. This gem contains the material in  its
structure. It is not in itself magically stored. It thus cannot be changed by
dispel magic, anti-magic shell, or Mordenkainen's disjunction. If the gem  is
somehow  destroyed  or  alter significantly, the  items  inside  it  will  be
destroyed.  The gem can only be accessed by someone with a read  gem  active.
The  gem can hold a maximum of 1 pound per gold piece. If its "volume" is too
small  to  contain a caster's ability, it shatters. If the  duration  of  the
spell  runs  out  the  structure  of the gem changes  back  into  its  normal
structure  over the course of 1 week per 100 gp worth. Any items  in  it  are
destroyed after it has changed back over half of its worth.
If  the  gem  is not filled to capacity, there is a chance that items  stored
within  it  will  not be destroyed if the gem is altered or  destroyed.  This
chance  depends on the state the gem is in and on the amount of  space  still
left  within  the gem. The chance is a base 100%, minus 1% per percentage  of
storing ability used, minus 1% per fragment of the gem (two large pieces  -2,
many small splinters probably -2000%).

The  material components are two gems of the same kind, size, price,  colour:
everything.  One gem then has to be enlarged with an enlarge spell.  The  gem
has  to be cut in half, hollowed out, and one half filled with enough potions
of  reduction to be completely filled. For every 100 gp worth, one potion  is
required. The gem the has to be sealed with ultimate glue. Once this is done,
the  whole  gem has to be reduced again to its original size. Now it  can  be
used as a material component for the actual storing gem.

This  spell  empowers  a gem with the ability to store within  its  structure
written  information of any kind - except scroll spells. The gem may store  a
maximum  of  five  pages of tightly written notes per level  or  three  spell
levels  per  caster level. This written information is strictly non-magically
stored  within the gem: it is not actually a language or letters  but  it  is
encoded  in  the structure of the gem. This code can only be read by  someone
who  has an active gem read spell. This spell, gem write, cannot be dispelled
later  by dispel magic nor by an anti-magic shell nor any other kind of magic
destroying  power  -  unless  the  structure  of  the  gem  is  destroyed  or
significantly altered.
The  gem itself is also a limit to how much it can hold. For each 50 gp worth
of  gem,  one  page  or one spell level may be stored.  That  means  a  gem's
capacity  is determined by the caster's level and by its worth. The  material
stored  inside the gem stays within the gem indefinitely - unless the gem  is
destroyed.
If  a  gem  is not filled to capacity, there is a chance that if the  gem  is
altered (like cut apart or cut into a different shape), the material  may  be
found  within  a  piece of the gem. The chance is equal  to  100%  -  1%  per
percentage  actually used (if a 5000 gp gem (up to 100  pages  or  100  spell
levels)  is  made  by a 14th-level caster (maximum of 70 pages  or  42  spell
levels),  bur  filled only to 35 pages or 21 spell levels,  then  the  wizard
would  have a 50% chance to find the information in one of the pieces of  the
suddenly  smashed gem) - 1% per fragment of the gem (the more fragments,  the
worse).

The material component is a single gem worth at least 50 gp. This gem has  to
be  untarnished by any flaws. This gem then has to be rolled  into  a  single
scroll of incomprehendable magic and another scroll of reduction.

This  spell  allows  the  wizard to kill one or more creatures  of  the  same
species:  the wizard chooses a creature as the initial target for the  spell,
and  after the incantations are complete, a black bolt shoots forth from  the
wizard's finger towards the chosen target. If this creature makes its  saving
throw  versus  spell at -2 (or if it has 15 or more Hit  Dice)  there  is  no
effect and the spell terminates.
If  the saving throw of the initial target fails, the creature dies, and  the
spell  continues  as  follows: if there are no more  creatures  of  the  same
species  within the area of effect, the spell ends at this point.  Otherwise,
the bolt will continue jumping to other targets. The bolt jumps randomly from
one  target to the next; range is not a consideration - as long as the target
is  in  the area of effect, and it is of the appropriarace, it may be hit  by
the  bolt.  Each  creature that is hit with the bolt must make  a  successful
saving throw versus spell (with no modifiers) or die.
This  spell will affect a number of Hit Dice equal to: 10 HD + 1 HD per level
of  the  wizard  (the number of creatures is not a factor).  The  spell  will
terminate  when one or more of the following occurs: the Hit  Dice  limit  is
exceeded, there are no more potential targets in the area of effect,  or  the
bolt strikes a target with more than 15 HD (such a creature is unaffected  by
this spell). Each target hit with the bolt counts towards the Hit Dice limit,
whether its saving throw was successful or not.
The bolt will never jump to a creature of a different species, or to one that
has  already  been hit (whether living or dead). Any creature with  more  Hit
Dice  than  the  original target will not be affected by the  bolt,  but  its
number  of Hit Dice is still counted towards the Hit Dice limit of the spell.
If  a  target's  Hit  Dice would exceed the limit of the  spell,  it  is  not
affected (and the spell terminates).
The  bolt  will  never jump back to the wizard; in addition, the  wizard  may
choose  individuals to be unaffected by the spell simply by  naming  them  as
part of the incantations (usually used to avoid killing friends or allies).
Note  that  some races are closely related, but are not considered  identical
species  for purposes of this spell (i.e. goblinkind). "Half-breeds" will  be
affected by this spell if either of their parent-race is targeted, as well as
when  the cross-breed is specifically targeted. However, if a parent-race  is
named  as  the  target, a half-breed of that race earns a +2  to  its  saving
throw.  For example, a half-elf is affected normally if half-elves are  named
as  the target of this spell. They would also be affected if either humans or
elves were targeted, although they would gain a +2 to their saving throws  in
the latter two cases.
After this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful system shock roll
or  fall  unconscious for 1d10 rounds. Note that the DM may wish  to  inflict
other  penalties on the wizard due to loss of blood (see material  components
below),  especially if the spell is cast more than once is a short period  of
time.

The material components of this spell are a pint of the wizard's blood and  a
figurine  or  statuette of the race to be targeted. The blood is consumed  at
the  time  of  the  casting, and the figurine is also destroyed,  unless  the
wizard makes a successful saving throw versus spell.

The  Magic  of Nilrem is a series of humorous spells made in AD&D 2nd-edition
format.  They aren't intended for game use, but if a DM has a real  sense  of
humour,  pertinent game information is included. The following spell  is  one
not normally found in Nilrem's tome: it is actually useful.
This  potent spell creatures large cracks in the surface of the ground around
the  caster  out  of  which gushes water. The number of  cracks  that  appear
depends on the preparation time: 2d6 cracks of a maximum of 8 feet in  length
appears  for  every 3 days spent in preparation. The cracks (and  the  water)
last for 1d12+3 days for every 3 days the caster spends in preparation. After
casting, the cracks gradually appear over a period of 12 hours and the amount
of water gushing out reaches its maximum after that time. The water itself is
not  drawn from the surrounding lands (which would yield little) but from the
elemental  plane  itself.  After the spell has  run  its  course,  the  water
trickles to a stop and the cracks disappear soon after. The water created  by
this spell has a 10% chance of returning to the elemental plane every 60 days
causing  the  normal  effects of water loss in any  plants  or  animals  that
consume it. This effect's chance of occurring decreases by 1% for every level
above 20, to a minimum of a 1% chance at level 30. The material component  of
this  spell is a jewelled stave of at least 1000 ceramic pieces in value that
is  used to mark off the cracks and enough powdered crystal to distribute  in
even quantity over all the cracks, failure to do so results in spell failure.

The  wizard  casts  this  spell upon one speaker or  storyteller  before  the
creature  touched  begins telling a frightening story to an  audience  within
hearing range and can hear the tale clearly. When the storyteller begins, the
individual audience members must make a saving throw versus spell at  -4.  If
they  fail,  they become caught up in the story and listen attentively,  even
"oooo"ing and "aahhh"ing with genuine feeling, while the storyteller's  voice
and movements direct the spell's effects, enhancing lighting and sound in the
immediate  area. Those who save wander off, disinterested. Those  who  cannot
understand the speaker automatically save.
After  the  story's  conclusion,  those who failed  their  saving  throw  are
heartened  the  exhilarating performance and receive a +2  initiative  versus
undead and +2 to save versus fear for the next 24 hours. Those who saved  are
unaffected and receive no such bonuses.
The  reverse  of the spell, dishearten, causes those who failed their  saving
throw  become depressed and receive a -2 initiative versus undead and  -2  to
save versus fear for the next 24 hours. Audience members must sit through the
entire  story  to receive the bonuses or penalties. They do not  wish  to  be
interrupted,  but attack or similar interruptions can break  the  spell.  The
same applies if the speaker stops for longer than one round. If the spell  is
cast  on a bard, he has the conscious decision to allow or disallow the spell
to occur.
The  caster  performs  only  a  small  portion  of  the  verbal  and  somatic
components. The storyteller actually performs the rest through his voice  and
movements, thereby directing the spell effects himself.

Casting  this spell changes the casters hands into ghastly clawed  terminals,
much like a ghouls. The wizard may then attack with these decayed hands.  The
damage  is  1d3 per claw + Strength bonus. A saving throw versus paralysation
must  be  rolled  by  the creature hit. Those failing the  saving  throw  are
paralysed  for  1d4 rounds. Note that the caster can attack with  both  hands
with appropriate penalties.
Elves, slimes, undead, and automatons are immune to this spell.
Spellcasters may cast other spells while this spell is going, but  any  other
touch spell will negate the ghoul hands.

     Wizard's Level Summoned Giants
     16-17     hill (12 HD) or stone (14 HD)
     18-19     fire (16 HD) or frost (14 HD)
     20+  cloud (17 HD)

The  wizard can summon up to 1« HD per level. The giants summoned will  never

When this spell is cast upon a fighter or priest, the spell will increase his
Strength  to  that  of a giant. The particular Strength  gain  is  determined
randomly by a 1d20:

     D20  Strength  Giant     To-hit    Damage
     Roll Equivalent     Type Bonus     Bonus
     0    18/00     Ogre +3   +6
     1-6  19   Hill giant     +3   +7
     7-10 20   Stone giant    +3   +8
     11-14     21   Frost giant    +4   +9
     15-17     22   Fire giant     +4   +10
     18-19     23   Cloud giant    +5   +11
     20-21     24   Storm giant    +6   +12

The die roll is modified by the following:
          -1 on the die roll if the recipient is below ninth level;
           No  adjustment  if  the recipient is between ninth  and  fifteenth
level;
          +1 on the die roll if the character is above fifteeenth level.
Other information on boulders, opening doors, and bend bars/lift gates can be
found  in  the Player's Handbook under Strength, and in the Dungeon  Master's
Guide, page 63.

The  material  components of the spell are three hairs from  three  different
types of giants.
Note:  this greatly improved Strength spell play tested well in our campaign.
The limitation of "fighters or priests only" was put on by the researcher  to
prevent those nasty thieves from using it to backstab, since we multiply  all
damage in a thief's backstab attack.

This  spell opens a small gate to the quasi-elemental plane of vacuum. Within
the  area  of effect, all the air is suddenly eliminated. This does not  last
long enough to cause asyphixiation, but the resulting rushing of air into the
area  causes  1d6 damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum  of  10d6),
regardless  of  whether or not the victim(s) require  air  (even  undead  are
affected).  The  rushing  air also causes a massive  roar,  like  a  clap  of
thunder,  which  will  deafen victims for 1d10  rounds.  A  saving  throw  is
allowed;  if  successful,  reduce damage to half,  and  the  victim  is  only
deafened for 1 round.

The  material  component for this spell is a small lodestone,  encased  in  a
legume.

      This  spell makes the caster's hands very sticky, like being dunked  in
honey  and  let dry. This stickiness will add a +10% to climbing  percentages
and a +15% to pick pockets skills (this is added to thieves only, it does not
convey  the  ability  to  pick  pockets). The  spell  can  be  activated  and

This  spell causes an acid cloud to form anywhere within range of the  spell;
the cloud billows out to its full dimensions (10x10x5 feet for each level  of
the  wizard)  instantaneously and everyone caught inside the area  of  effect
suffers  4d6 points of damage; a successful saving throw versus spell reduces
damage  by  half. Anyone who fails the saving throw must roll  saving  throws
versus acid for all possessions to avoid destruction.
Immediately  after  the acid cloud forms, it bursts into  flames,  inflicting
another  4d6  points of damage to all inside. As before, a successful  saving
throw  versus  spell  reduces  the  damage by  half;  those  individuals  who
successfully saved versus the acid, receive a +4 bonus to their saving  throw
versus  fire. If this second saving throw fails, possessions must save versus
magical  fire  or  be consumed (the +4 bonus mentioned previously,  does  not
apply to these saving throws).

The  material components for this spell are the intestines of a black  dragon
and the heart of a red dragon; both are consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell is similar to Glamden's acid fire: when cast, this spell forms  a
gas cloud which is also highly acidic. Anyone caught inside the cloud suffers
8d6 points of damage. This spell requires two saving throws versus spell: the
first  is against the gas, and the second is for the acid. If neither  saving
throw  is  successful, full damage is inflicted on the victim; if one  saving
throw  is  made and the second fails, the victim suffers _ of the damage;  if
both  saving  throws are successful, the victim suffers half damage.  If  the
saving throw versus the acid fails, all possessions must save versus acid  to
avoid being destroyed; the gas has no effect on the victim's possessions.
If   a   target  has  immunity  against  one  component,  damage  is   halved
automatically.  It is reduced to one quarter of normal if  the  saving  throw
versus the other component is successful as well. Of course, if a target  has
immunity against both components, it is not affected by this spell at all.

The  material components for this spell are the intestines of a black  dragon
and the stomach of a green dragon; both are consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell  is similar to Glamden's other spells, acid fire and acidic  gas;
when this spell is cast, a jet of green gas shoots from the wizard's palm;  a
split-second  later, the gas erupts in flames. This jet is 10 feet  long  per
level of the wizard, and is 5 feet wide; anyone hit by the jet must make  two
saving  throws versus spell (one for the gas, and the other against fire)  to
avoid  suffering 8d6 points of damage. The procedures for saving  throws  and
immunity versus the two components are the same as for Glamden's acidic  gas,
except magical fire replaces the acid component.

The  material components for this spell are the heart of a red dragon and the
stomach of a green dragon; both are consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell  requires  the  wizard to have  a  potion  of  any  type  in  his
possession.  The potion is held in the wizard's hand, and when the  spell  is
cast, the content is instantly removed from its container and reappears in  a
potion  container  in  the target's possession. The DM then  makes  a  potion
compatibility check (see the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 135) for the target
potion and applies the results normally. If the target has one or more potion
containers in sight, the wizard may choose which one to affect. If the target
has  no containers in sight, then one is affected randomly; if the target has
no  potion  contaiin his possession, then the spell has no effect. This  will
also work on a potion that is just about to be quaffed, as long as the wizard
gains the initiative.
The only material component for this spell is the potion to be mixed with the
target's potion.

Globe of fire is a wizard's last line of defense. When cast, a fireball  goes
off,  centred  on the wizard. However, the caster takes no damage  from  this
fireball,  and can act as if the fire did no exist (i.e., can  see  and  hear
normally).  Any  creature within 5 foot per level of  the  caster  takes  1d6
damage per level of the caster.
Notice  that the actual area of effect is left up to the caster,  though  the
maximum  size  is 2 foot per level. Also, the spell lasts for a short  while,
protecting  the  wizard from physical attacks (i.e., swords,  arrows,  claws,
etc.,  miss since the wizard is effectively shielded from view), spells (fire
based  spells  add  an  extra  round per damage die,  cold  base  halves  the
duration,  and all other spells are left up to the DM), breath  weapons,  and
gaze  attacks.  The material component of this spell is a  pinch  of  diamond
dust, worth at least 400 gp.
As example, Jasper the mage is in way over his head. While travelling, he was
beset by 20 bandits. So, he casts globe of fire to keep the attackers at bay.
Since  he is a 10th-level wizard, a globe of fire springs up that is 20  feet
in  diameter.  Anyone caught in the area of effect takes 10d6 damage,  taking
half if saved.
However, note that Jasper's horse is probably dead.

This spell causes a transparent globe, 2 metres in radius to form around  the
wizard.  The  globe  acts as a barrier to all matter: no  creature  may  pass
through  the barrier in either direction, nor may any attack be made  through
the  barrier using physical weapons either against or by the wizard. It  does
not  impede magic in any way: if the wizard is the target of a fireball or  a
blue  dragon's breath weapon, he will still take full damage. The wizard  may
terminate the spell before the full duration, but he may not lower the  globe
of  force without terminating the spell. A successful dispel magic will bring
down  the globe. The material component for this spell is a golden globe with
silver linings, worth at least 300 gp.

      This  spell causes the object or person affected to emit an eerie glow.
The  colour ranges from blue to green. It cannot be dispelled but it  can  be
negated by a darkness spell. The saving throw is made at +1 per level (or Hit
Die)  of  the  victim, but at a -1 per level of the wizard. The glow  is  not
bright enough to read by, but is easy to spot in the dark.

The material components of this spell are some fireflies.

      This  spell  causes any smoothed, ordinary pebble to glow  with  enough
light  to  see about 20 feet well. The spell requires a pebble  held  in  the
caster's  hand  while  arcane words are muttered. Unfortunately,  this  spell
works only on small, rounded stones, which are consumed by the spell (imagine
yourself in the middle of a desert or sea and all you have is a small,  uncut
diamond: agony).

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level priest spell glyph of warding. Unlike
the  glyph of warding, the glyph of shielding is actually cast on the  priest
himself. If, in combat, the priest is successfully hit by an attack roll, the
glyph  of shielding is set off and affects the attacker. This occurs even  if
the  priest  took  no  damage (i.e. was protected by a stoneskin  or  similar
magic).  The priest is not affected by the glyph of shielding. See  the  3rd-
level priest spell glyph of warding for restrictions and typical glyphs.  Any
priest spell or its reverse may be used as a glyph of shielding, provided the
priest is high enough level to cast it. The material components of the  spell
are determined by the type of glyph (if any are necessary).
Spells  which  normally require only a successful to-hit roll  and  allow  no
saving  throw  (destruction, cause serious wounds, harm, etc.)  are  given  a
special  saving  throw. The attacker must save versus spell with  a  negative
penalty  equal  to the priest's level divided by 3 (i.e.:  1 per  3  levels).
Success  equals  half damage or negation depending on the type  of  glyph.  A
special case is the destruction glyph, where a successful saving throw  stuns
the  target for one round. The damage from the attack against the priest  and
the damage from the glyph of shielding are simultaneous.
The  material component for this spell is a golden statue of at least 400  gp
value, portraying the caster.

This spell is similar to the 3rd-level priest spell glyph of warding and  the
4th-level  spell  glyph of shielding. Unlike glyph of warding  and  glyph  of
shielding,  glyph  of smiting is cast on a melee weapon used  by  the  priest
himself.  If  in combat, the priest is successfully attacks with  the  weapon
with the glyph of smiting on it, the glyph is set off and affects the target.
Damage from the glyph replaces any normal weapons damage.
This  occurs even if the target would normally take no damage from the attack
(i.e.:  was  protected by a stoneskin or similar magic). The  priest  is  not
affected  by  the  glyph  of  smiting,  but  the  weapon  must  save   versus
disintegration or be destroyed, regardless of the type of glyph. See the 3rd-
level priest spell glyph of warding for restrictions and typical glyphs.  Any
priest  spell or its reverse may be used as a glyph of smiting, provided  the
priest is high enough level to cast it. The material components of the  spell
are determined by the type of glyph (if any are necessary).
Glyph  of smiting may be combined with the spiritual weapon spells (spiritual
hammer,  spiritual staff, spiritual flail, and spiritual mace) by casting  it
on the material component of the spell (i.e. the weapon) prior to casting the
spell  itself.  Note  that  a successful attack  which  sets  off  the  glyph
immediately ends the spiritual weapon spell.

The  priest  can summon a swarm of gnats to bother and harass the victim  for
the duration of the spell.
For  example: a man is stalking Bob-the-wonder-druid through the forest.  The
fellow  gets closer than Bob would like, and, unless he acts fast, is  liable
to  get spotted (a situation he'd like to avoid). The man has a 30% chance to
spot  Bob  normally, but with the swarming gnats, his attention is elsewhere,
so  his  chances are cut to 15%. The material component for this spell  is  a
dead gnat.

The  wizard casts this spell by snapping his fingers. After doing  this,  the
wizard is instantly transported behind his opponent (the wizard must be  able
to  see  this area). When this happens, an image of the wizard remains behind
and  imitates the actions of the wizard for two rounds, then disappears.  The
foe  receives a saving throw versus spell to believe the image is unreal. The
material component for this spell is a bit of sulphur.

This  spell, when cast while a wizard is memorising his spells for  the  day,
calls  upon  the  gods  of chaos to grant the wild mage  a  small  amount  of
priestly  power. The wizard can substitute one or more of his  spells  to  be
memorised for priest spells of the sphere of chaos, albeit two levels  lower.
For  example, the wizard can memorise the spell random causality (a 3rd-level
priest spell of the sphere of chaos) instead of a 5th-level wizard spell.
This  spell can only be cast if the wizard is in good standing with the local
gods of chaos. If the wizard has fallen out of favour with these gods, or has
never  been  religious in the first place, no god will hear the request,  and
the casting of godly chaos will be wasted.
Note that the chance of spell failure for low Wisdom must be rolled when  the
granted spells are cast, if applicable. Failure indicates that the spells are
lost, without replacement.

The  material  components of this spell are offerings of incense,  and  other
valuable  items,  worth  no  less than 200  gp  per  level  of  priest  spell
requested,  which are burned in prayer during the casting of this spell.  Any
material components of the granted priest spells must be available when those
spells  are  cast, while an inscription of the wizard's sigil can  substitute
for a holy symbol.

Upon  casting  this spell, the caster raises the moral of friendly  creatures
and  any saving throws they make against fear effects by +5. Furthermore,  it
favourably  modifies all of their other 1d20 rolls by 4. This spell  however,
may  only  be  cast upon creatures not engaging in any other activity  during
that round. Once a creature has come under the effects of this spell, it  may
leave  the  50-foot  cube  and still retain its effects  until  the  duration
expires.
The  reverse of this spell, godly damnation, forces all creatures within  the
area of effect to save versus death magic or suffer a negative modifier of  4
to  all  future  1d20  rolls  for the duration of  the  spell.  The  material
component for both versions of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

By  casting  this spell, the priest calls down the attention of his  divinity
and  invokes the righteous wrath of the deity. As the earthly consequence  of
this  godrage,  the  priest goes berserk. He will, for the  duration  of  the
spell, instinctively attack in melee combat any unbelievers (creatures  of  a
differing alignment) within a 60-yard radius, giving preference to  the  most
extreme  alignments  first.  The spell does not give  knowledge  of  specific
alignments, only a feeling of who is the most worthy of being punished.  Note
that  use  of  this spell may result in the priest attacking  his  own  party
members.
While under the effects of the spell, the priest attacks on the fighter table
and  gains  a  temporary skill level with his weapons  (note:  in  my  world,
specialisation is more developed and certain priests can specialise  to  some
degree,  those who are not specialised gain the basic level of specialisation
for  the  duration of this spell). Furthermore, the presence of the  divinity
surrounds the priest in the form of an aura that reduces all damage taken  by
the  priest  by  2  HP (1 HP minimum). Godrage is a state  not  unlike  going
berserk,  but it differs in that while the priest engages solely in  physical
combat, he is still able to make intelligent decisions on how combat is to be
conducted.  After the spell ends, the priest must rest 1 round  for  every  2
rounds  under the spell's effect. The components for this spell are  a  short
verbal sermon given to the unbelievers and a consecrated weapon.

By  means  of this spell, the wizard converts a number of gold pieces,  minus
some  random percentage, into a single gem of equal value. The wizard  places
the  gold  pieces  in the left pan of an ordinary balance, speaks  a  command
word,  and the coins vanish. A single gem appears in the right pan, equal  in
value  to  the amount of coins minus 1d10%. This extra amount is the material
component. The wizard can convert up to 200 gold pieces per level per use  of
the spell. Thus, a 5th-level wizard could convert up to 1000 gold pieces into
a single gem.
The  reverse  of the spell, gems to gold, converts a single gem  (subject  to
level  limits), placed in the right pan of the balance, into  gold  coins  of
equal worth, minus 1d10% of the value of the gem. If too many coins, or a gem
of greater value than the wizard can convert at his current level, are placed
on  the  balance,  the spell is lost but nothing is expended materially.  The
type of gem obtained cannot be specified by the wizard.

When cast, this spell causes the victim to be followed by a crazed man who is
convinced  that the victim is a gopher. The man has a magic wand that  shoots
magic missiles as projectiles. However, the man always misses but he shows up
at  the worst times, for example when sneaking up on a sleeping dragon.  Even
though  he  misses he will continue to attempt to shoot the victim succeeding
in destroying the area where the victim is.
The  man  has AC -2, 200 HP, regenerates 2 points of damage per melee  round,
has  an  Intelligence of 5 and a Wisdom of 3. He just loves to  yell  "freeze
gopher!"  at the top of his voice. While this spell is in effect, the  victim
has a -95% to his chance to surprise. The material component of this spell is
a gopher tail.

This  spell  causes  the  creature touched  during  the  spell's  casting  to
instantly  fail its Constitution checks for intoxication during the  next  12
hours.  A  creature in this state will become rapidly drunk  no  matter  what
strength  of alcohol they are drinking. The victim is generally not aware  of
the  spell's existence on itself and may be puzzled by its lack of tolerance.
The  duration of the spell is one turn or until used, whichever comes  first.
The somatic component is a friendly pat on the back, and the verbal component
is a cheery "Drink up!".

This  spell is actually a class of spells, which have been researched in many
forms  by  many different wizards. The spell creates a blast  in  a  20  foot
radius, which does 1d6 per level damage, with a saving throw for half damage.
In  the  invocation versions, the spell creates a condition in  the  area  of
effect;  this version does not expand to its full volume in confined  spaces.
The evocation version creates a small point of fire, cold, or whatever, which
instantly explodes to full radius.
The  most  basic  form of the spell is the fireball. Other  versions  include
iceball, steamball, etc. A wizard who knows any one version of this spell can
research  any other version at 50% of normal cost; he may also research,  for
free, versions of the same spell that differ only in the kind of damage done,
after  experience  in the appropriate elemental plane. If  you  use  "maximum
number of spells known per level" in your game, extra versions of this  spell
of the same level as versions already known do not count towards the limit.
The  basic  version of the spell is third level and does a  maximum  of  10d6
points of damage. Versions of this spell above third level exist, the spell's
level being determined by the following additions:

     Cost Effect
     Free Different damage type (iceball, steamball, etc.).
     +1   Invocation version (does not expand in confined spaces).
      +1    Spell does 1d6+1 or 1d8 damage per level (same maximum number  of
dice).
      +1    Can  be  reduced to half radius at casting time,  which  adds  an
additional     +1   point per die damage and gives -2 on saving throws.
     +2   Spell does a maximum of 15 dice of damage.
      +3    Delayed blast for up to 5 rounds (cannot be used with  invocation
version, since there is no explosion to delay).

For instance, a delayed blast fireball that did 1d8 damage per level would be
a 7th-level spell (+1 for damage, +3 for delay).

The  material  component is a small ball made of bat guano and  a  relatively
common  substance  associated with the type of damage caused  by  the  spell:
sulphur for fireball, salt from boiled water fosteamball, etc.

This  spell causes a number of arms equal to the level of the wizard to reach
out  of the ground and grab at the target. The hands themselves do no damage,
but when they pull a victim under, that victim begins to suffocate.
Victims  have  to make a saving throw every round they are  in  the  area  of
effect  and for every extra hand they have a -1 on their saving throw.  In  a
graveyard  or similar corpse-infested area there is an additional -2  to  the
saving  throw. If a victim fails its saving throw, it is dragged  underground
and  starts  to  suffocate.  Others can dig  the  victim  out,  mundanely  or
magically.  He will be found two feet or so under the ground, paralysed,  but
quite  aware  of  what happened. A really high-level wizard could  cast  this
spell and affect many people by giving five arms to this target, four to that
one, and so on.

A  greater  death star enables the caster to create one or more death  stars,
fist  sized  balls  of negative energy that slowly drain the  life  from  all
around  them.  This  spell can create one large star or many  small  immobile
ones.
Doomstar  (one large): this is a 5-foot radius ball of swirling  light.  This
volatile  globe  drains life force at a rate of 1d10 +  1  HP  per  2  caster
levels.  For  example, a 10th-level wizard does 1d10+5 points of  damage  per
round.  The  doom star drains life from all within 25 feet of it. The  caster
can move it 30 feet per round in any direction (even up). The spell caster is
immune to this version of the spell.
Star  Swarm:  this spell creates one death star per level of the caster.  See
the  2nd-level  death star spell for a description. These  cannot  be  placed
within 10 feet of each other.
Both  versions  can be dispelled by the caster at will. Creatures  immune  to
death star are also immune to this spell.
Components  are a drop or swamp water, a pinch of diamond dust, and  shavings
from a lodestone.

This  powerful  spell  is a long range, heavy version of  disintegrate.  When
cast,  a  sizzling blue beam springs from the wizard's hand  destroying  1000
cubic  feet  of  matter  (10-foot long cube) per level  of  the  wizard.  The
material  component is a pinch of residue from a lodestone that was  used  to
cast a normal disintegrate spell. The saving throw is made at a -2.

This spell allows the caster to create a stationary wall composed of material
from  his  elemental plane of worship (templars may cast this  spell  in  any
form). As with the other elemental wall spells, greater elemental wall covers
a  20-foot-square  area  per level (the thickness  varies  depending  on  the
element); this area may be arranged in any manner to form a rectangular wall,
as  long  as neither dimension falls below 5 feet. While this set  of  spells
share common characteristics, such as duration and area of effect, the wall's
specific properties differ based on its composition.

     Element   Properties
      Air   Creates a wall of poisonous gas that is 20 foot thick. Damage  as
per cloudkill (page 166, Player's Handbook).
      Water     Creates a wall of boiling water that is six inches thick. Any
creature  passing  though a greater water wall suffers 3d8 points  of  damage
plus  1  point per level of the caster. While it is possible to fire missiles
through  the wall, these attacks are at a  4 to-hit and damage. Water created
by this spell disappears after the duration expires.
      Fire  Creates  a  wall of flames that is only inches thick  and  causes
damage as a wall of fire, as presented in the Player's Handbook (page 225).
      Earth     Creates a wall of iron that is ª inch thick per level of  the
caster.  Treat  as  a wall of iron (page 172, Player's Handbook).  Note:  The
duration  of  a  wall of iron is not permanent on Athas (page  93,  Dark  Sun
Resource Book).

The  material component is a bit of the element (air, water, fire, earth)  of
which the wall is composed.

This  powerful cloaking spell offers complete undetectability  to  the  user.
Even  true seeing is ineffective, as this spell was specifically designed  to
foil  this  type  of  magic. A limited wish will partially  foil  the  spell,
allowing  the  opposing wizard to see a blurry outline (-4 to-hit).  A  wish,
however, will bring the spell down. This spell is ineffective against  detect
individual,  because  of  the narrow scope of that divination.  The  material
component is invisible stalker ichor.

This  spell  creates  within  its area of effect  a  sticky,  incredibly  hot
material that adheres to whatever it touches. This material erupts into flame
when  in  an  oxygen atmosphere, will not be extinguished by fire,  and  will
cause  damage even when not flaming due to its incredible heat.  It  is  only
extinguished by the consumption of its fuel or application of enough cold  to
stop the reaction. Once warmed back up it will reignite, i.e., you can't  put
it out: it must burn out.
In game terms, the following effects take place:
           Fireball. The spell effect may be created up to 10 yards away from
the  caster for every level of said caster. The initial area of effect  is  a
sphere  of 1 foot in radius for every level of the caster. The initial damage
caused  by  the spell is 1d4+2 points of fire damage for every level  of  the
caster, save versus spell for half damage.
           The gift that keeps on giving. Everyone within the initial area of
effect  who  missed  their saving throw versus spell will take  1d4+(caster's
level)  points  of fire damage from the superheated paste adhering  to  their
person.  This  damage  continues  for the caster's  level  in  combat  rounds
irrespective  of  where the individual moves. A saving  throw  versus  dragon
breath  will  result in half damage. Two consecutive saving  throws  indicate
that  the  paste has burned out (the saving throw versus the initial fireball
counts  towards these two consecutive saving throws) and no more damage  will
be sustained from the paste.
           Splish  splash... An area of 5 feet around the initial  fireball's
area  of  effect is prone to having paste thrown out to it by heat  vortices,
thrashing  victims,  etc. Anything subject to heat damage  must  save  versus
dragon  breath (those with a Dexterity bonus versus directional  attacks  get
that  bonus) or suffer 1d4+(caster's level) points of fire damage from  being
struck  by  the superheated paste. A saving throw versus dragon  breath  will
result  in  half damage. One saving throw will indicate that  the  paste  has
burned out and no more damage will be sustained from the paste.
           Fire. Inanimate objects touched by the paste (or anyone with paste
on  them)  must  save versus normal fire or begin combustion. PCs,  NPCs  and
monsters must save versus petrification or be burned for 1d4 fire damage.
          Lingering... This stuff is nasty in that it will only be safe if it
is  left  to  burn  itself  out, indicated by the spell's  duration  of  open
flaming,  or by the indicated saving throws. If extinguished by reduction  in
temperature to -5 C (+23 F), or by magical means which end flame or heat, the
paste  will lie dormant until it heats up or is given oxygen. Then the  paste
will continue to burn for the remainder of the spell's duration.
Material   components:  pitch  or  tar,  sulphur,  saltpetre,  magnesium   or
phosphorus, oil or alcohol.

On  casting greenfire, a bolt of green luminescence appears from the wizard's
fingers, and impacts on the target (a successful saving throw means the  bolt
missed the target, but it hit somewhere...). From this impact point, a  green
sphere begins to grow, at a rate depending on the material consumed. Items in
this  area of effect must save versus disintegration every round. Items  that
save  halt  the  progress of the sphere until they fail their  saving  throw.
Note:  the spell expands for a set time, not to a set radius, so an  artifact
that  continues  to  save will halt the growth of the  sphere  for  the  full
duration of the spell.
Rate of growth:
           200  feet per round in air alone: (not an aerial weapon),  but  as
soon as it hits something solid, it will take one tenth of a round to consume
it.
          10 feet per round in an air-solid mix (cliff face, floor, person).
          5 feet per round in just rock (ordinary rock gets no saving throw).
           1  foot per round in water (but it draws everything to it  like  a
sphere of annihilation).
Notes:  the sphere begins at a 1-foot radius, and does not appear  until  the
bolt  either strikes something solid or reaches maximum range. The  point  of
origin of the sphere remains constant, even if in midair.

The material component for this spell is an emerald worth at least 50 gp.

spell activity is known as well. If a saving throw versus death magic is made
by  the  caster, he is granted some additional information about  the  spell,

selected  persons.  To  activate  the  spell,  the  wizard  must  touch   the
recipient's  body anywhere a shadow is visible. A saving throw  versus  death
magic  on  the  part  of the recipient negates the spell.  Failure  to  save,
however,  causes the target's shadow to be replaced by Gregori's  shadow  for
the  next 24 hours. During this time, the caster can concentrate and be  able
to  hear and see all that is occurring around the recipient within a 20  foot
radius.
Gregori's  shadow is made ineffective by the recipient entering  an  area  of
total darkness, such as that of a underground cavern or a darkness spell.  In
this  case,  the spell is ineffective until the recipient enters a  condition
where  a  shadow  is  again  created. In addition, Gregori's  shadow  can  be
dispelled by a successful application of a dispel magic or remove curse  cast
upon the victim.
Gregori's shadow is only effective on creatures of the prime material  plane.
If  the  recipient or caster enters another plane of existence, the spell  is
instantly  broken.  Also,  the casting of light or  continual  light  on  the
recipient allows another saving throw with a +2 bonus on the die.
It  should be noted that during the course of the spell, the caster will  not
demonstrate a shadow whatsoever.

this  spell  to  potentially reduce the effectiveness of enemy wizards.  When
cast,  the target creature must make a saving throw versus death magic or  be
affected  by  Gregori's  spell damper. Failure  to  save  causes  the  target
spellcaster's spells to be reduced in effectiveness, which is represented  as
a temporary reduction of the target's level with regard to the spell's range,
area of effect, damage and duration only. This in no way reduces the target's
true level, number of castable spells or other abilities.
For  each  round  the  spell damper is in effect, the caster  rolls  dice  to
determine the damping effects for the current round. If the caster  is  tenth
level  or less, roll 1d2. Wizards of eleventh through fifteenth level  use  a
four-sided die and those of sixteenth through twentieth level use a six-sided
die.  Spellcasters of twenty-first or higher level also use a six-sided  die,
but  add one to the result for every even-numbered level above twentieth. The
maximum amount of dampening that can occur with Gregori's spell damper is six
levels.
In  order  to cast this spell, the wizard must create a miniature  drum  from
platinum  and  perfect  sheepskin  then  stuff  it  with  the  purest  cotton
available.  Total cost of the material components would be approximately  400
gold pieces and two weeks of construction time.

This  spell  is exactly the same as the 1st-level wizard spell magic  missile
except  for  two  changes: (1) the area of effect - everyone in  spell  range
could  possibly  be  hit  with 1 or more missiles - and  (2)  the  number  of
missiles  that can be fired by the wizard - for every 3 levels of experience,
the  wizard  can fire two magic missiles (i.e., level 1-3: 2 missiles,  level
4-6: 4 missiles, level 7-9: 6 missiles, etc.).

By  casting  this  spell,  the wizard alters the entire  composition  of  the
subject's  body so that it becomes more elastic. The benefits gained  by  the
elasticity  are  as follows. The affected person can turn his  head  180   in
either  direction,  can stretch all of his limbs up to 3  feet  further  than
normal,  and  only takes half damage from bludgeoning type  weapons  (with  a
minimum  of  1 point of damage). Increased flexibility of all body  parts  is
also gained. The material component is a lump of soft clay.

This  spell  allows one person the ability to stretch either or both  of  his
arms  up to 1 foot longer per level of the caster. The outstretched arms  may
be  lengthened or shortened as often as desired while the spell is in effect,
although  they  may not be shortened more than they were to begin  with.  The
person  affected  may  fight with outstretched arms at  -1  to-hit.  Thieving
abilities  involving  the  hands  may be performed  with  outstretched  arms,
although with a -5% penalty for every 2 feet the arms are outstretched. If an
outstretched arm takes more than 15 points of slashing damage in one blow, it
is severed. This spell can only be cast once per person while the spell is in
effect  (that  is, a caster may not cast this spell on the same person  twice
before  the duration of the first spell is finished, and neither can  another
caster). The material component is a bit of gum Arabic.

This spell alters one person's feet so that they are able to grasp as well as
his  hands can. The recipient of this spell must not be wearing shoes, or 1d3
points  of  damage  will be taken due to the lengthening of  the  feet  in  a
cramped space (soft leather boots must save or rip apart). The recipient must
also be human or humanoid for the spell to take effect, and unwilling victims
are  allowed  a saving throw. The prehensile feet will add +30%  to  climbing
rolls.  If  in  a position to use feet to attack with weapons, this  is  also
possible,  though at a non-proficiency penalty if the attacker is  proficient
with  the  weapon, and double that penalty if the attacker is not proficient.
Somatic  components of spells of third level or lower may be  performed  with
prehensile  feet. The material component for this spell is a  bit  of  monkey
fur.

The  priest can cause a single plant to show a week's worth of growth in  one
day.  This  spell  can be cast at most once per day per plant.  The  material
component for this spell is some fertiliser or humus, and some water,  to  be
given  to  the plant (the components are not consumed by the spell, but  they
are  by the plant). If the priest wishes to continually cast this spell, then
he  should be prepared to furnish additional fertiliser and water to  sustain
the plant.

The spell animates and enlarges (to M size) an intricately carved statue. The
statue needs to be of such craftsmanship as to fetch at least 1000 coins, and
should  be depicted wielding a weapon of some sort. The weapon carved on  the
statue becomes the guardian's specialised weapon.
The  guardian  is  a  fighter of 5 levels lower than the wizard  casting  the
spell,   i.e.,  a  15th-level  wizard  creates  a  10th-level  fighter   with
9d10+3+(Constitution bonus) hit points, who gets 2 attacks per round with his
specialised weapon.
If  a  shield is carved on the statue then the guardian also gains a  buckler
and  becomes  proficient in sword & shield specialisation. Otherwise,  he  is
specialised  in  single-weapon-style. If the statue  is  very  finely  carved
(worth  2000 gp or more), the fighter gains an extra specialisation  in  one-
weapon-style.

This spell summons a small quasi-earth-elemental (1d4 HP) to stand watch.  If
some  creature moves across or under the ground into the area of effect  that
weighs  more than 1 pound, the elemental will cause the ground to shiver  and
wake  people up (detection of creatures is by movement and vibrations  across
the  ground).  The elemental can also form a hand and try to  trip  intruders
(the  guardian is semi-intelligent and can remember simple commands from  the
priest,  like who the party members are). The guardian is hard to detect  and
will  almost  always trip from surprise. Opponents get a saving throw  versus
death  magic  to avoid tripping   a successful saving throw means  they  just
felt  something  trying to grab their leg. The material  components  of  this
spell are the priest's holy symbol and a live worm.

This  spell creates a dim, floating light of variable intensity that  follows
the wizard. At its brightest, it is enough to read with good eyesight, and it
can  be  extinguished  and restored at will during  the  duration.  No  light
produced  by the spell escapes the 5-foot radius, preventing the wizard  from
being given away by his light, so this spell is ideal for thieves. Note  that
background light penetrates the area of effect freely, so the wizard is in no
way  concealed by this spell. The material component for the spell is a  silk
black blindfold.

      One  wire (up to 10 feet long) can be stretched across a hall, or such.
The  wire  becomes camouflaged - undetectable without find traps.  The  first
creature  to attempt to pass must save versus rod, staff or wand (adding  its
Dexterity defensive adjustment) or be caught when the wire springs free.  The
wire will twine tightly about the ankles of its victim, tripping him. It must
then  be tediously untangled (or sawed loose) which takes at least 30 seconds
under ideal conditions. If hacked loose in combat, it will take 1 round,  and
the  victim will take 1d4 points of damage unless an enchanted blade is  used
(which  will  cut  without effort). Note that the wire is required,  but  not
consumed. The material component is a small spring.

This  wild  magic spell bends light waves around the recipient,  creating  an
effect  similar to the 2nd-level spell blur and a cloak of displacement.  The
recipient's  form is both blurred and sways (regardless of movement),  making
him much more difficult to hit. When the spell is cast, roll 1d4 to determine
the Armour Class and saving throw bonus.
This spell was developed by the wild mage Gymlainac, in an effort to create a
wild magic version of invisibility.

This  spell summons a rain of stones in the area of effect. The spell  causes
1d3  points  of damage per level of the wizard to all within the area,  to  a
maximum  of  15d3. However, the wizard must make a normal to-hit roll  versus
each creature in the area to see if they are hit by the stones. If the to-hit
roll is unsuccessful, the creature takes no damage. The material component is
a handful of small stones.

This  spell  is  an  improved  version of unseen  servant.  The  servant  has
rudimentary intelligence so that it can remember some small details  or  some
minor  instructions over a given period of time. It can  be  delayed  in  its
actions, so that it will do something even if nobody gives it an order to (it
will  close  a door behind the wizard if he gave it the order to close  every
door  behind him). It can also write or manipulate delicate objects if it  is
under  the  direct control of the caster. In this case the caster has  to  be
present  (within the range of the spell) to give the specific orders.  It  is
still  not  stronger  than the 1st-level spell (only a  maximum  lift  of  30
pounds).

This  spell is identical to hallucinatory forest (q.v.), save that the priest
causes an area to appear as if it is a relatively flat plain or clearing.
The greatest uses for this spell would be to hide a forest to protect or trap
others. Other uses would be to hide a chasm, mine, or to extend a cliff...

      This  spell, when cast, will cause the affected person to keep thinking
there  is  a  just one more step (or stair) in front of them, you know,  like
when you go up 10 flights and start forgetting you have got to a landing  and
take  that  extra  step.  It reduces movement rate by  5%  and  is  extremely
annoying.  This effect happens, even when the affected person is  walking  on
flat ground.

This  powerful spell is invoked primarily against invading armies or in siege
warfare. The spell's primary effect is to destroy troops or fortifications of
creatures who have done unredressed damage to a priest or his companions. The
spell  begins with the priest describing the atrocities an army  or  band  of
marauders  is guilty of. The priest must have first-hand knowledge  of  these
crimes,  or  must have heard testimony from a witness under the effect  of  a
zone of truth or true speak spell.
The  spell strikes as a great column of force that descends from the sky. The
area  of  effect is a circle whose radius is 5 feet per level of priest.  All
creatures  within  the  area of effect take 1d6 HP per  level  of  priest  in
damage. Creatures making a saving throw versus spell take half damage.  Small
objects  must  save  versus crushing blow or be destroyed. Structures  suffer
damage  as if hit by a heavy catapult (2d12). Any creature unfortunate enough
to  be flying over the area of effect takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10
feet  above the ground the creature was flying to a maximum of 10d6 plus  the
normal damage due to the crushing blow of the spell.
When  cast over water, the spell raises a wave 10 feet high per level of  the
priest, travelling 30 feet per minute in a circle that grows outward from the
area  of  effect.  On land, the force of this spell often crushes  trees  and
rends the earth producing a great cloud of dirt and dust, obscuring the  area
for 1d4+1 rounds.
The  material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol and  a  war
hammer  which the priest throws into the air as the spell is cast. The hammer
is destroyed in the casting.

A  target of the hand of Ithiqua, failing to save versus paralysation will be
pinned  to  the  ground by an invisible force. The force is illusionary,  but
will  seem completely real to the victim, so that he will be unable to  move.
The victim will be pinned to the ground at a location of the wizard's choice,
and  despite any struggling will have a movement of 0 regardless of Strength.
The subject will be very prone, +4 to be hit (with no Armour Class adjustment
for Dexterity) and -4 to attack.

By casting this spell, the next spell the wizard casts will be held (will not
take effect) until either the duration ends or the wizard says a keyword that
will  set off the spell. The spell that is held must be third level or lower,
and a wizard can only have one spell hung at any given time. For those spells
that  require  a direction or a special action (like pointing  a  finger  for
lightning  bolt), the wizard will have to say the keyword and point  at  that
time. It takes 6 seconds for the held spell to go off (no casting time,  just
a  delay  in  going off), and the wizard should be given  a  bonus  of  3  to
initiative. When the keyword is spoken by the wizard, it is only  letting  go
of stored energy. The wizard still has 80% of his activity left in the round:
the  wizard can make one attack or cast one 1st- or 2nd-level spell  late  in
the round.
The  spell  to be held must be cast with extreme caution. It will take  twice
the casting time and twice the components it would normally take to cast that
spell. If the wizard tries to cast another spell while another spell is hung,
the hung spell will fizzle.
No  material components are needed to cast hang, but those needed to cast the
next spell after are doubled.

Upon  casting  this  spell,  the  wizard  causes  a  burning  boomerang,   of
approximately 2 foot, to appear in his hand. This boomerang can be thrown  on
any  target the spellcaster desires and explodes the moment it makes contact.
If  the  target is missed the boomerang will return to the caster.  Once  the
boomerang reaches the caster he can try to catch it.
The  caster is immune to any fire damage the boomerang causes, but not to the
explosion.
The  caster can throw the boomerang over a range up to 60 yards (60 yards  is
long  range;  40 yards is medium range; 20 yards is short range).  Apply  the
appropriate to-hit penalties for the range.
The  wizard  is able to, mentally, guide the boomerang, for which the  caster
receives a +5 bonus on his attack roll. If the wizard is not proficient  with
the  boomerang,  the bonus will negate the penalty for not being  proficient.
The target must be in a line of sight.
If  the caster uses the boomerang as a club, it will only do 1d6-2 damage and
the caster will receive a -2 to-hit because the weapon simply is not designed
to be used as a club.
The  boomerang inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage when it hits the target.  This
damage  is  bludgeoning damage and not fire damage. If the wizard misses  his
target,  but  still  hits the unmodified Armour Class of  the  opponent  (the
Armour  Class  without the protection from shield and armour),  the  opponent
will only receive the fire damage and not the bludgeoning damage.
After  the  initial  hit,  the boomerang explodes in  an  outburst  of  fire,
delivering  another  1d6  fire damage per 3 levels of  experience  (up  to  a
maximum  of  5D6).  The  explosion fills an area of 3-foot  radius  which  is
enlarged  by  another  1  foot for each 5 levels of the  caster.  Combustible
materials  are  set afire when they do not save. Creatures  in  the  area  of
effect also receive a saving throw versus spell for half damage.
There  is  no  saving  throw,  because, once hit  by  the  boomerang,  it  is
impossible  to  jump  out  of  the area of effect  of  the  explosion.  Magic
resistance  will negate the fire damage (if successful checked) but  not  the
bludgeoning damage. As long as the caster holds the boomerang in  his  hands,
it will not explode. To catch the boomerang, the wizard must make a Dexterity
check  with  a penalty of -2 or -3 if the boomerang was thrown on  medium  or
long  range.  If the boomerang is caught, the wizard can throw it  again  and
again,  up  to  5 rounds +1 round per two levels of experience  (provided  he
catches the boomerang each time). He can only throw it once per round with  a
weapon  speed  of 4. The boomerang can only be caught if it  didn't  hit  the
target and returned to the wizard.
There is a chance that someone or something tries to intercept the boomerang.
If  this someone or something tries to intercept the boomerang, roll  on  the
following table:

     D8 Roll   Result
     1    Interceptor becomes target and boomerang explodes: roll for damage.
      2-3  Boomerang bounces off the interceptor and falls 1d6 foot from  the
interceptor  after  which  it explodes. Damage to everyone  in  the  area  of
effect.
     4-5  Interceptor intercepts and the spell wears off. Boomerang vanishes.
      6-7  Interceptor misses the boomerang. Boomerang returns to the caster.
Roll to catch.
      8     Interceptor manages to get the boomerang off course.  The  wizard
must  make a Dexterity check with a -4 penalty (cumulative to range modifier)
to catch the boomerang.

If  the wizard did not catch the boomerang, it will fly randomly through  the
area  in which it was thrown for 1d4 rounds. The cater cannot mentally  guide
the  boomerang any more. If the boomerang was thrown at short range, it flies
through  an area of 20 yards. Every creature (including the caster) shmake  a
Dexterity check to avoid the boomerang. The boomerang has no target any  more
thus  it  will explode against the first object or creature it hits. So  that
object or creature becomes the target.
If the boomerang reaches the caster after a complete circle through the area,
the  caster  cannot  catch the boomerang any more,  he  now  has  to  make  a
Dexterity check to avoid the boomerang, just like any other creature.

The  material components are a bit of sulphur and a boomerang worth at  least
50 gp.

     When cast on an arrow, this spell enables that arrow to ignite itself as
soon  as it's in free flight (shot, thrown, fallen, etc.). As soon as nothing
is  in  touch with the arrow any more, it will spring to fire and act like  a
normal burning arrow.

      The  arrow radiates light in a 30 foot radius, just like a torch  does.
But  when  it hits a target, it delivers damage as an arrow, +1  due  to  the
fire.

      After the arrow ignite, it will burn for 10 rounds, setting fire to all
combustible materials which come into contact with the arrow, unless the fire
is extinguished.

      After  the  arrow  is  used, it is completely  burned  up.  If  it  was
extinguished, it will disappear. If the arrow wasn't used, it will become  an
ordinary arrow after the spell's duration expires.

     The fire is not magical and the arrow does not count as a +1 weapon when
fighting against creatures that can only be hit with a +1 or better weapon.

The material components for this spell are the arrow and a bit of sulphur  to
be applied to the arrow.

Haste  allows  the psionicist to force his body and any  equipment
his is carrying, through the space-time continuum at a little over
twice  the  normal  rate.  This gives the  psionicist  double  his
normal  movement  rate, double his normal number  of  attacks  per
round,  all three of  the ability scores for double his dexterity,
and  divides  his  initiative roll in half.  It  also  causes  the
psionicist  to  have to pay double the maintenance  cost  for  all
powers,  including  haste, used while using  haste.   All  of  the
advantages  and  the  disadvantage  last  until  he  stops  paying
maintenance  cost for haste.  Haste does not cause the  psionicist
to age any more rapidly then normal.

Power  Score:   The psionicist becomes a blur and he  receives  an
additional -4 to his armor class.

20:  The psionicist jumps through time 1D4 hours and receives 1D10
hit  points of temporal burn damage.  All equipment he is carrying
must also make saves verses fire or be burned up in the jump.

Do to their unique physical nature, creatures from the elemental planes (air,
water, earth, and fire) and the paraelemental planes (rain, silt, magma,  and
sun)  cannot be cured by normal means while on the prime material plane. That
is  to  say,  spells from the necromancy school, such as cure  light  wounds,
heal, and regenerate, produce no effect. In order to repair damage to such  a
creature, the priest must act as a conduit for healing powers specific to the
creature's  home  plane; heal elemental allows the caster to  serve  as  this
conduit.  Thus, the priest may only heal creatures from his plane of worship.
Neither Dark Sun druids nor templars are able to cast this spell, since  they
do  not  have  a  direct link to the elemental planes (a druid's  powers  are
granted  via  the  spirit  of his guarded land, and a  templar's  spells  are
granted by his sorcerer-king).
Upon the initiation of this spell, the caster must establish physical contact
with  the elemental creature (he cannot be wearing gloves) and maintain  this
contact  for  at least 1 round. For each round that he maintains contact,  he
heals  1 HP per his level. For example, Baltasar, a 9th-level priest of  air,
summons  a lesser air elemental and sends it into battle. Although the  first
wave  of  opponents are defeated, the elemental has taken damage.  Since  the
enemy's reinforcements are several rounds behind, he casts heal elemental and
may  restore 9 HP to the elemental per round until battle is resumed or until
all  hit points are restored (it cannot have more hit points than it did when
initially conjured).
While  it is possible to cast the reverse of this spell, harm elemental,  the
caster must still touch the target and maintain contact for at least 1 round.
Needless  to say, the elemental will experience this treatment as  an  attack
and  attempt  to fight back; however, if the priest can keep  his  hold,  the
elemental suffers 1 HP per level each round. Use the wrestling rules  in  the
Player's Handbook to determine what type of hold the caster achieves  and  if
he  can  maintain  it after the initial round; in addition,  wrestling  moves
normally  inflict no damage on such creatures (do to their immunity  to  non-
magical attack forms) above the damage from this spell. Since the priest  can
only affect creatures from his plane of worship, he must be very careful with
the use of this spell lest his powers be revoked.
Note  that this spell does not convey resistance to the elemental's  element;
thus, using this spell on a creature from the elemental plane of fire or  the
paraelemental plane of magma   in the absence of some protective magic   is a
hazardous proposition.

Unlike cell adjustment healing will not cure any type of diseases,
but  it  does  have  a better hit point to PSP ratio  for  healing
wounds.   The  psionicist will heal one hit point  of  damage  for
every one PSPs they spend (1:1 ratio).

Power  Score:  The patient is totally healed and only one  PSP  is
spent.

20:   The  psionicist  suffers the number of  hit  points  he  was
healing, but the patient is unaffected.  If the psionicist is  the
patient he still suffers the damage.

This  spell  induces a sudden heart attack in its recipient. A  saving  throw
versus  death  magic is allowed. If the saving throw is failed, the  creature
must make a Constitution check. If the check fails, the creature dies. If the
creature survives, he will be totally incapacitated for 1d6+6 game weeks.  He
will  also  permanently  lose  one  point  of  Strength  and  one  point   of
Constitution, and will have a 5% chance of a future heart attack  every  time
he  is ever again required to make a Constitution check. Note that this spell
does require its victim to have a heart, so not all creatures can be affected
(golems, undead, slimes, etc.).

This  spell  causes  the affected creatures' footgear  to  become  very  hot,
blistering the victims' feet. Because of this, the target fights  with  a  +2
bonus  to-hit, a +2 penalty to its Armour Class, loses any Dexterity bonuses,
and  moves  at 5/6 of its normal speed. The reduction in movement rate  lasts
until  the  blisters  have healed. Creatures that are immune  to  fire  don't
suffer any of these effects. Flammable footgear must save versus normal  fire
or be ruined; footgear that saves is merely a bit charred.
Alternatively, this spell can be used to counter the effects of natural cold.
In this mode, the spell will keep the affected creatures' feet comfortablwarm
for 1 turn per level of the wizard, even in snow or ice.

The material components for this spell are 2 leaves of stinging nettle.

This  power  will create a shield of hot air around the psionicist
that  will absorb cold around the psionicist.  It will reduce  the
damage  of  cold based attacks by 1 hp/die or give  a  +1  to  any
saving  throw.   It  will  also  protect  a  character  from  cold
environments   such  as  a  tundra,  but  not  from   super   cold
environments like the elemental plane of ice.  It will  also  make
the  character invisible to infravision.  Anyone trying  to  touch
the  character  without  some kind of protection  from  heat  will
suffer  1d6  hp/round.   The psionicist, however,  will  take  1d4
hp/round  damage  from  heat  if this  power  is  used  in  a  hot
environment.

Power Score:  The power is doubly effective, causing 2d6 points of
damage, conferring a +2 bonus and saving 2 hp/die.

20:  Cold Shield power is activated instead, even if the character
does not know it.

This  spell  causes the affected area to become warm, maintaining a  constant
temperature of 40oC (96oF). This is intended primarily as a heat source,  not
an  attack, although if used against cold-based creatures, they will take 1d4
damage per round they remain in the area of the spell.
The spell is reversible (chill), causing the area to lower in temperature  to
0oC  (32oF). Used against heat-based creatures, they will take 1d4 damage per
round during the time they remain in the area of effect.

This  spell causes excitation of air molecules so as to make them emit  heat.
The  heat thus created is equal to that of a small fire in intensity, but its
radius is limited to 1 yard in diameter. It lasts for the duration indicated,
or  until the priest utters a word to extinguish the heat. The heat will melt
1/12  cubic  foot  of ice per round. The spell can take effect  wherever  the
priest directs as long as he has a line of sight or unobstructed path for the
spell.
If  this  spell  is cast on a creature, the applicable magic  resistance  and
saving  throw  rolls  must be made. Success indicates that  the  spell  takes
effect  in  the  area  immediately behind the creature, rather  than  on  the
creature  itself.  Failure indicates that the target  creature  will  take  2
points  of  damage  per  melee  round from the  heat  unless  some  means  of
protection from heat is available. The material components for the spell  are
a  tinder  box and some wood shavings. Fire resistance (through a  potion,  a
ring,  or  the protection from fire spell) totally negates the effects  of  a
heat spell, as will immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cone of cold
or ice storm.

fountains  and  wondrous sculptures out of water (or water-like  substances).
For example, the caster can make a portion of a lake into a flowing fleur-de-
lis or a courtyard pool into a shimmering fountain. There are no restrictions
on  what  shape or form the water may take, save the artistic talent  of  the
caster.
This  spell may only be cast upon still, or nearly still portions  of  water.
Any  attempt  to  use  this spell on turbulent waters  will  fail.  Heethem's
hydromorph can be cast upon a creature from the elemental plane of water, but
the creature is allowed a saving throw versus death magic (at +4) in order to
avoid  being  reshaped  by this spell. In any event, the  creature  is  still
allowed  all  of its normal attacks and may resume its natural shape  at  the
beginning of the next round.
If desired, a permanency or semi-permanency (see the Dragon Kings supplement)
may  be placed on Heethem's Hydromorph, although complete evaporation of  the
liquid will break the spell.
This  spell will not function on the elemental plane of water or its adjacent
plane  of  ooze, but operates normally on any other plane that can contain  a
liquid.

This  spell is a compromise between the 5th-level teleport and the  7th-level
teleport  without  error. It allows a wild mage to  improve  his  chances  of
teleporting  on  target by up to five categories on the Teleport  table,  but
these category improvements must be split between separate rolls for position
and velocity.
Unlike  the standard teleport, the wizard must roll twice on the error  table
(see  the players handbook, page 172). The first roll indicates the error  in
position,  as in a normal teleport. The second roll determines the  error  in
velocity - a high roll indicates that upon arrival, the caster will be flying
up into the air, and a low roll indicates that the caster will be flying down
towards  the  ground. The speed of travel is equal to 1 foot per  second  for
each percentage point by which the caster is in the high or low region on the
table. This added velocity will add 1 hit point of damage per foot per second
to any falling damage incurred, and will stun the wizard for 1 round per foot
per  second (even if no falling damage is incurred: if the wizard arrives  on
target  travelling down at 12 feet per second, he will not take  any  damage,
but will be stunned for 12 rounds).
The five categories of improvement can be applied to either of the two rolls,
at the wizards preference. For example, a wizard teleporting to an area never
before  seen may choose to apply three categories to the position roll  (thus
rolling  on  Studied Carefully for position) and two categories  to  velocity
(rolling  on Seen Casually). Any improvement beyond Very Familiar results  in
no possibility of error.
Note  that  unlike  teleport without error, this spell  cannot  be  used  for
interplanar travel.

This  spell causes the healing benefits of sleep to be threefold (i.e., 3  HP
are  healed  per  day rested). Additionally, this spell causes  any  and  all
curative  spells cast during its duration to have maximum effect plus  1  HP.
The  individual  to  be affected must be able to sleep, and  must  be  asleep
during  the  spell's effect. The casting time of this spell is 6 turns  minus
the priest's level, with a minimum of one turn. The material component is the
priest's holy symbol.

becomes  even  more  severe, being 1 energy level per round.  If  all  energy
levels are drained, then the victim becomes a half-Strength wraith under  the
control  of  the  caster.  There are several ways to  stop  or  extinguish  a

This  is the ultimate revenge spell. The caster prepares for this spell in  a
quiet  and safe place and spends the next week casting the spell. After  this
week  the spell takes effect and the caster slips into a heavy sleep for  one
month.  The  effects  are  well worth the lost time  though.  The  victim  of
hellfire immediately bursts into flames. The flames not only consume the body
of the victim, they also consume the soul. After 24 hours all that is left of
the  victim  is a crusty, burnt out corpse. This person can never be  brought
back to life by any means. The victim's soul is being eternally burned, never
to  be  healed. The only way to save the victim is as follows: before the  24
hours  is  up the victim must have cast upon him limited wish, cure  disease,
remove  curse,  and bless all at the same time. If this is done,  the  victim
permanently loses half of his hit points (recoverable by a wish only)  and  4
Constitution  points.  The caster loses a quarter of his  hit  points  and  1
Constitution  point. Note: if during the one week of casting  the  caster  is
interrupted he suffers the effects of the hellfire in a backlash type effect.
Components: a belonging of the victim, a 500 gp ruby and a magic weapon of +3
enchantment or greater.

      The power allows the psionicist to determine the location of
the  spelljammer/helm  aboard an active spelljamming  vessel.   It
works like clairvoyance, providing an image of the helm room, just
as  a  clairvoyance would.  The difference is that the  psionicist
need not know where the room is.  The image is suitable enough  to
allow  the  psionicist to teleport, dimension door, etc.  to  that
room  (using  the  requisite power,  of  course).   It  does  not,
however, show where in the ship this room is.  The interior of the
room may reveal this.

1:  Power works, but helmsperson is aware of being watched.

Power  Score:   Psionicist does know where the  helm  room  is  in
relation to the rest of the vessel (but not necessarily how to get
there).

20:  The psionicist sees a random room in the ship instead.

This  devotion is useful only for spelljamming psionicists.   This
means  they must be using a serial, pool, or other helm which  can
be  used by psionic creatures.  If the power succeeds, the  MV  of
the vessel increases by 1 while the SR increases by 3.  This lasts
for a duration of three rounds.
      The  psionicist can not use the power again during that day,
due  to  the  stress induced on the hypothalamus  by  this  power.
Should the power be attempted a second time, there is a 55% chance
that  it  will fail, leaving the psionicist insane (although  with
his  powers intact).  Such insane helmspersons have been known  to
decide that ramming a larger vessel (or even ordering a full stop)
are excellent combat options.
      In  a serial helm, several psionicists could use this power,
but  not  all at once.  Using more than one of these powers  on  a
helm has no effect.

1:  The MV is unchanged, but the SR still increases.

Power Score:  Lasts for 5 rounds.

20:  The helm is inoperable for 1 round.

This spell is a powerful weapon against undead creatures. When it is cast,  a
thin  ray  of about 1cm in diameter springs forth from the priest's  pointing
finger  and  strikes the selected target. Any undead creature so struck  must
save versus spell or take 6d8 points of damage and roll on percentile dice as
if  hit  with a mace of disruption. If the saving throw is made, the affected
creature  takes  4d8 points of damage, with the remaining  2d8  striking  the
priest in a backlash of energy.

haste (or a potion of speed) is immune to hesitate.

Through the use of this spell, the priest establishes a link between his life
force  and the subject creature's. The effect of this link is that  half  the
damage  sustained by one is transferred to the other. This link is  evidenced
by  a  golden, pulsing, thread connecting the two through the ethereal plane.
When  the link is in existence, the two creatures cannot be more than 1  mile
per  level of the priest apart or the link will snap, ending the spell. Those
able  to perceive the ethereal plane can see this link. Note that the  damage
transfer  is  two  way. A duly consecrated altar, holy or  unholy  water,  an
appropriate  sacrifice (DM's discretion) and the creature to be  linked  with
are the material components for this spell.
Side  note: I used this for an evil priest the party was trying to kill.  The
priest  kidnapped  the betrothed of the paladin and performed  this  ceremony
upon her. This really messed up the party, since now, they couldn't just rush
in  and hack up the priest in an orgasm of hack 'n slash. They had to capture
the priest and remove him from his sanctuary alive. I run consecrated grounds
as  being  "home  field"  for priests and very disadvantageous  for  would-be
desecrators.  Examples: a  1 penalty on everything per alignment  difference,
cumulative bless for priests and generally bad luck for the intruders.

1  damage  (may be zero). The priest must touch the arrow immediately  before
being  shot and the arrow is destroyed after begin shot, whether  or  not  it
hits.
This  spell will not affect magic arrows or crossbow bolts but will work with
a magic bow. The priest needs his holy symbol for the blessing.

This  spell summons the spirit of a dead dog to act as the priest wishes  for
the  duration of the spell. The dog has one Hit Die for every odd  level  the
caster  has (1 HD for levels 1 and 2, 2 HD for levels 3 and 4, etc.). A  non-
combative dog is useful mostly for warning and will vanish after one  warning
or  1d6  hours  +  1 hour per level, whichever comes first. A  combative  dog
fights  as a dog with Hit Dice as generated by the summoning and lasts  until
killed  or  1d6  rounds + 1 round per level. Both have  an  Armour  Class  in
inverse  proportion to caster level up to level 10 (level 1: AC 10, level  2:
AC 9, etc.). Past level 10 the dogs have AC 0.
The  material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, dog  fur
(for a non-combative dog) or a dog tooth (for a combative dog).

were  actually present. The maximum time in the past that may view safely  is
100 years per level of the caster. The wizard can try to view even further in
the past, but for every 50 yea or fraction thereof, additional, there is a 3%
chance that caster will permanently lose 1d4 points of constitution. Thus, if
an  18th-level wizard tried to view an event two-thousand years in the  past,
there  would  be a 12% chance that his Constitution would be reduced  by  1d4
points.  In  any  event,  at  the termination  of  the  spell,  the  caster's
Constitution is temporarily dropped to 3 for a number of days equal to  twice
the number of centuries viewed backward in time, rounded up.
The  region being viewed is the same location as where the wizard  casts  the
spell,  albeit in the past. While "in the past", the caster may  move  around
and  visually inspect anything in sight, but any attempt to touch an item  or
person  nets  a  negative result (i.e., the caster's hand  passes  harmlessly
through the person or item).
Also,  the caster has the option of changing which time period he is viewing,
subject  to the same limitations mentioned above. This allows the  caster  to
"fine-tune"  the  date  he is viewing without having to  re-cast  the  entire
spell.  During  the spell's duration, the caster's mind has effectively  left
the  body,  thus  making  the wizard's body a prime  target  for  possession.
Normally  suitable  protections  are  in  place  before  attempting  to   use
hindsight.
During the casting of the spell, the caster is required to burn numerous rare
spices  and  rare  woods  (worth at least 20,000 gp)  in  an  unused  brazier
specially constructed for this purpose.

      This  spell  allows the wizard to "tune in" to the psychic  impressions
left  on an object or small area. This power gives the wizard the ability  to
divine  hidden  purposes,  prior owners, secret  compartments,  and  powerful
alignment bends.

      The spell will not identify a magic item per se, but would for instance
tell the wizard that the ordinary looking golden ring he holds is in fact the
signet ring of a long deceased noble house. Further, use of thehistory  spell
doubles  the  chance that the value of an antique or relic will be  correctly
guessed.

     This spell is usually used on non-magical plunder, books, and items sold
at  auctions  (to  verify  claims made about their antiquity).  Although  the
casting  time is long, it is unobtrusive, and only a single touch is required
to  make the spell work. The material component for this spell is a page from
an encyclopedia.

Hobar made a few minor adjustments to a previous spell and also gained a  few
levels  before  designing this improved version of nasty shards  (q.v.).  The
spell's  effects are the about same, but the shards are larger  and  tend  to
resemble daggers. A 17th-level wizard would be able to hit 4 targets.
Material  components  are  a silver dagger and a  lodestone.  The  dagger  is
destroyed during the casting, but the lodestone remains intact.

Hobar  created this spell for use on creatures immune to fire and cold.  Upon
utterance of this spell, metal shards fly from the casters fingertips to  the
target doing 10d4 points of damage. An additional target may be selected  for
every  3  levels of experience the caster has (damage done is still 10d4  per
target).  Therefore, a 10th-level wizard can hit 3 targets.  The  target  may
save  for  half  damage.  Material components are a  porcupine  quill  and  a
lodestone. The quills are destroyed during casting, but the lodestone remains
intact.

When  a wizard cast a hold non-evil spell, he causes a paralysis upon one  or
more  creatures of non-evil alignment. The number of creatures  that  can  be
affected  is a function of Hit Dice or level. The spell affects 1d4  HD  plus
one  Hit  Die  per level of the caster. A maximum of 14 HD can  be  affected.
Creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected first.
This  spell can be memorised only once per week, but the number of times that
it  is cast affects the saving throw allowed. The first and second time  that
the  spell  is cast, the creatures don't make any saving throw.  After  that,
look the table:

          Creature
     Number of Saving Throw
     Times Cast     Modifier
     3    +1
     4    +2
     5    +4
     6    +5
     7    +7
     8    +8
     9    +9
     10   +10

The  spell can be cast 10 times before re-memorising it. The wizard  can  re-
memorise  the spell to avoid the modifier in the saving throw,  but  he  need
twice  time  to  do it. This spell was created by a lawful good  wizard,  who
wanted to avoid fighting non-evil persona.

including  conjured spirits and spirits possessing another creature.  If  the
spell is cast at 3 or 4 spirits, each gets an unmodified saving throw. If two

at  -3.  Held beings remain aware of events around them and can use abilities
which do not require motion or speech. The material component for this  is  a

The  orb  is  a  spell normally granted to a priest who expects to  encounter
enemies whose alignment (with respect to good or evil) opposes his own.  When
cast,  the  spell  streaks from the caster's hand to  the  desired  point  of
effect, where a sphere forms. The sphere drains the essence of life from  the
targets in the area of effect. Unintelligent undead are immune to this effect
(as they are animated, not "unliving").
The  sphere does damage based on the alignment of the caster with respect  to
the targets. If the alignment is opposed to the caster (good versus evil) the
damage  is 6d6 HP plus 2 points per caster level, and saving throws are  made
at   2.  If  the  alignment is only one removed from the caster (good  versus
neutral  or  evil versus neutral) the damage is 6d6, with saving throws  made
normally. If the alignment is the same as the caster's the damage is  6d6  HP
minus 2 points per caster level, with the saving throw being made at +2. Note
that  more experienced casters may thus cast this spell into a melee  without
harming  friendly forces. The material component for this spell  is  a  small
glass sphere of the appropriate colour: clear (holy orb   good caster), dusty
grey (orb of balance   neutral caster), or black (unholy orb   evil caster).

This spell can be cast only by a priest of (any) good alignment. It generates
a  brilliantly radiant image of the casting priest's holy symbol.  No  matter
from  which direction the image is seen, it always appears to be viewed  from
the front. Creating the image requires a powdered gem of not less than 25,000
gp  value,  which is consumed entirely. The colour of the symbol is dependent
on  the  alignment  of the priest, as well as his strength of  faith.  White,
silver,  and  gold are taken for lawful, neutral and chaotic aligned  clerics
respectively. These colours are ethereal, wispy, and pale;,as  if  the  image
were made of smoke or flame.
The  first, immediate, effects are ones that take place to affect  undead.  A
maximum 25 HD of undead may be affected: lowest first, and any fraction  left
over can still affect the next creature if at least half of its Hit Dice  can
be affected. The following effects take place:
           All  undead  5 HD or less must save versus death magic  at   2  or
disintegrate to dust, 6 HD or more must save versus paralysis  at   2  or  be
rendered immobile for the duration of the spell.
           All  mindless undead still present must then roll versus spell  at
2,  or  forget their instructions and wander aimlessly, while sentient undead
must roll versus spell at  2 to remain conscious.
           While  bathed in the light of the holy presence (in  the  area  of
effect), all undead must take 5d4 plus the caster's level in damage per round
and fight at  2 to-hit.
Next,  the  general effects of the spell take place. A maximum of  30  HD  of
living  opponents  can be affected: lowest first, and a  fraction  left  over
still affects the next creature if at least half of that creature's Hit  Dice
can be affected. This affects the living as follows:
           Diametrically opposite aligned opponents take immediate damage  at
the rate of 5d4 plus the caster's level every round, and will continue to  do
so  until  they  either leave the area of effect, the  spell  expires  or  is
dispelled. The affected know what is causing the damage unless under charm or
feeblemind or something like that.
           Those  who  are evil, but not diametrically opposite,  still  take
damage,  but  only  when the spell is initially cast: 3d6 plus  the  caster's
level in damage the first complete round the spell is in effect.
Additionally,  the caster can choose two of the following additional  effects
to take place:
          The caster is given +2 to everything: to-hit, damage, Armour Class,
saving throws, checks, turning, etc. Those with a bow have unerring aim  with
normal  shots,  called  shots get a 0 penalty. Anyone attacking  the  casting
priest while the spell is in effect suffers a  1 to-hit and a +1 Armour Class
penalty.
           Any  opponent  with  magic resistance  loses  some  of  its  magic
resistance in order to break this spell. Diametrically opposed have a penalty
of  20%,  identical  alignments have a penalty of 5%,  all  others  10%.  For
example:  a lawful good priest casts holy presence. A chaotic evil  demon  of
25%  MR is penalized 20%, and is therefore effectively 5% magic resistant for
the breaking of this spell.
           Any other spell, or item used to give a spell effect, cast or used
by  the  priest  at this time does maximum effect. Some may  even  be  doubly
effective, as determined by the DM.
           No  outer planar creature may enter the area of effect unless  its
alignment  matches that of the caster. This spell operates on the astral  and
ethereal  plane, and on the first layer of all the outer planes,  at  reduced
efficiency to be determined by the DM.
           An opposing priest of at least 4 levels higher than the caster  is
able to dispel another presence in effect, by casting his own version of  the
presence spell.
Two diametrically opposing presences with overlapping areas of effect cause a
vortex to consume all matter contained therein within a fraction of a second.
Also,  they cause a 10% chance that one of the involved deities will send  an
envoy  to  investigate  such a major disturbance. If each  side  successfully
sends such an entity, the event could become highly escalated. Any other  two
presences may overlap, combining or cancelling their benefits and penalties.
A  few  notes:  the  spell does take into account that  people  of  differing
alignments may make up the caster's party, and they are counted as allies and
friends  of the caster. On this point, the spell only acts against those  who
were counted as foes by the caster at the moment the casting of the spell  is
complete. Anyone who was in the caster's party is exempt from the spell, even
should they turn on the party while the spell is in effect.
Also,  it may be that the spell will fail those who have been less devout  in
their  practices. Either the spell may not work at all, or it might  backfire
and affect those of his own alignment doubly, or something the like. Increase
the  chance of being noticed by the deity to 5% while this spell is in effect
things would have to be pretty serious to cause such a casting, or the priest
is  showing off and needs chastisement. The material component of this  spell
is the caster's holy symbol.

Homophobia  causes a person, regardless of orientation, to become  angry  and
nauseous  at the concept or sight of any person or behaviour which  might  be
construed as homosexual. The subject will attempt to evade and void any  such
thing and, if evasion proves impossible, hostile and even violent.
Homosexuals  affected  by  this spell will be constantly  ill  at  ease.  The
reverse, heterophobia, has exactly the same effects, except that the aversion
is  towards  heterosexuals and heterosexuality. The material component  is  a
lump of mouldy cheese shaped like a triangle (or a square, for the reverse).

When  cast  on the end of a length of rope, that end may be tossed away  from
the wizard (being subject to gravity), where it will remain hanging in midair
at  its furthest point from the wizard for the spell's duration. Five persons
may  climb the rope and hide at its end (in extra-dimensional space), unseen,
drawing the slack with them as they go. Also, the spell may be used as a make-
shift grappling hook when there is nothing for a hook to catch onto. The rope
may  be  thrown upwards up to 3xStrength feet at most and generally  less  if
accuracy is desired. Horizontal throws may be twice this number if there is a
ten  foot radius of swing room. The material components for this spell are  a
paper Moebius ring and a string of yarn.

To  cast this spell, the wizard must hold the palms of his hands against  his
mouth,  in  a horn-like shape. The issued sound causes severe mental  anguish
and  suffering to evil creatures in the area of effect. At the  beginning  of
each round, each of such creatures rolls a saving throw.
If this is failed, then:
          the creature suffers 1d6 points of damage;
          there is a to-hit and Armour Class penalty of -1;
          all spells about to be cast are lost.
If  the  saving throw succeeds, the creature suffers only the second penalty.
In  order to maintain the spell, the caster must concentrate, but he can't do
so  for more then one round per level. Non-evil creatures aren't affected  at
all.  Note that the spell will affect even deaf creatures, as the sound  sort
of  goes inside their brain, bypassing the hearing organs. The spell  can  be
reversed by evil wizards to become a horn of evil. The material component  is
a violin string.

      This spell causes the wizard and all his clothing to become engulfed in
flames.  These flames do not harm the wizard or his equipment but  cause  1d4
points of damage to anyone within 5 feet and an additional 1d6 to anyone  who
actually touches him. The flames themselves are only about as hot as a  torch
but  the  surrounding  area  will feel like a  blast  furnace.  The  material
component for this spell is a burning torch, which is consumed in the casting
and must be used to set fire to oneself.

By  casting this spell, the wizard appears to be covered in a mist of  water.
One  version is coloured blueish green; the other is coloured violet or blue.
Any  creature striking the wizard with body or hand-held weapons will inflict
normal  damage upon the wizard, but the attacker will take double the  damage
so  inflicted.  The other powers of this spell depend on the variation  being
used:
Blueish  green: any electrical attacks will be saved at +2 on  the  die,  and
will  do  either half damage (if the saving throw is failed) or no damage  at
all  (if the saving throw is made). Acid based attacks are normal, but if the
wizard  fails  the  required  saving throw, he sustains  double  damage.  The
material component for this version is a bit of tree gum.
Violet  or blue: any acid attacks will be saved at +2 on the die and will  do
either  half  damage (on an unsuccessful saving throw) or no damage  (if  the
saving throw is successful). Electrical attacks are normal, but if the wizard
fails  to make the required saving throw he sustains double damage from  that
attack. The material component for this version is an alkaline substance.

The  victim  of  this spell must save versus magic or be  hypnotized  by  the
wizard,  thus  obey all commands of the wizard, except those that  are  self-
destructive  or  radically against his alignment. While under the  "unclosed"
spell,  it  will  be  somewhat apparent that the  victim  is  under  a  charm
(Intelligence and Wisdom checks apply), however, the spell may be "closed" by
the  wizard until the duration expires. To do this, the wizard may  give  the
victim  a  set of instructions to obey under a specific set of circumstances.
Until  those  circumstances arise, the victim will act normal  not  realizing
that he is under the spell.
After  the  spell  has elapsed, the victim will have no recollection  of  any
events while under hypnosis unless the wizard has instructed him to remember.
In  this way, the victim's long-term memory for the hypnosis period can  also
be  programmed.  To effect the hypnosis, the wizard must use  a  small  shiny
object  to catch the victim's attention. This object is not consumed  in  the
casting.

Upon casting this spell in conjunction with another type of spell, the wizard
delays  the effects of the second spell until certain conditions  are  met  -
named  by  the wizard. For example, the wizard could cast if ...  then  at  a
doorknob,  then direct a fireball into if ... then, and then name  conditions
that  the  fireball  will  activate when someone touches  the  doorknob.  The
casting of the second spell must be started within 1 turn after finishing the
casting of if ... then.
If ... then spell must be cast upon a non-living object. If ... then actually
absorbs the second spell's effects and holds it until the conditions are met.
This  hold  can be for thousands of years. The conditions that  activate  the
spell  must  be easily recognized and simple. The DM can decide  whether  the
conditions  are  appropriate.  For example,  a  wizard  could  not  have  the
condition,  "If a good creature comes into the room...", but could  have  the
condition, "If an orc enters the room...".
Only one if ... then spell can exist at a time in a 5-foot radius. If two  if
...  then  spells  come  within this range of each  other,  both  spells  are
dispelled.  Thus, a wizard could not have a collection of darts in  his  pack
that  all have an if ... then and an ice storm cast upon them. The spell used
with  if ... then cannot be a spell that must be aimed at an opponent.  These
spells  include magic missile, Melf's acid arrow, etc. However,  a  sleep  or
cloudkill can be used, and the object it was cast upon will be the centre  of
the effects.

The  victims  of  this spell will be overcome by revulsion and  be  otherwise
totally  grossed  out  by  a  sickening  illusion  of  the  wizard's  choice.
Particularly  inventive and disgusting illusions may warrant anadjustment  to
the saving throw of up to -5 (DM's discretion). The wizard may effect 2 HD of
creatures  per level. Note that after the spell is cast, it proceeds  without
the  wizard's aid for the normal duration. For a normal functioning  of  this
spell,  no  material components are required. However, use  of  some  proper,
imaginative, and especially yucky components may add an additional adjustment

By  means  of this spell the caster is able to ignite a single metal  weapon.
The  weapon  must  be  either  a  special constructed  blade  of  mithril  or
adamantite or a regular (steel) blade which has been consecrated in a special
rite  using a ceremony and bless spell and holy or unholy water. This confers
an  additional  2d6  points  of damage on a successful  hit  by  the  weapon.
Creatures  especially  vulnerable to fire take  an  additional  4  points  of
damage.  Conversely, creatures that are normally immune to  non-magical  fire
suffer  4  HP  less.  A  successful saving throw versus magical  fire  halves
damage. Note that attacks which hit the creature, but don't do damage  (i.e.,
didn't  penetrate  armour  or  hit  a  stoneskinned  or  similarly  protected
creature) will do half or no fire damage depending in the saving throw.
If  someone  besides  the caster wields the weapon, the  following  penalties
apply:
          The spell duration is halved
           The  wielder  takes 1d6 points of damage per round  (save  for  no
damage)
At  the  end  of  the spell's duration, the weapon has to make  a  successful
saving  throw  versus  magical  fire  with  the  following  modifiers  or  be
destroyed:

consecrated steel blade  0
mithril blade  +2
adamantite blade    +4
consecrated mithril blade     +6
consecrated adamantite blade  +8

If  the  weapon fails this saving throw the caster takes 4d6 points  of  fire
damage (no saving throw).

The  material component is a bit of sulphur and oil which is sprinkled on the
blade.

The  Illumine spell acts as a multiple light spell. The wizard may create two
globes of light, with an additional globe per two levels of experience of the
wizard above the seventh. Immediately after casting, two globes appear  where
the  wizard  wills. The additional globes appear in the following round.  The
wizard must spend that round specifying the centres of spell effect, and  may
take  no  other action in that round or all succeeding globes are  lost.  The
wizard  may  permanently dispel some or all of the globes at any time  during
the  duration of the spell. The material component for the spell is one piece
of  phosphorescent moss for each globe. In all respects other than  the  ones
above, this spell conforms to the restrictions of the light spell.
Illumine  was  the  fourth of six spells researched  by  the  wizard  Auralon
Deathrin  in  his  lifetime. It was developed as a partial  solution  to  the
annually  increasing crime rate in the capital of Travinthia. They make  good
streetlights with some form of spell extension!

      This  spell  generates the image of a large, brown  scaled  dragon-like
creature  (about  15-20  feet long). The illusory wyvern  is  realistic,  but
relies heavily on the wizard's Dexterity. It fades away if moved more than 50
feet  (yards outdoors) away from the wizard, but will fade back into view  if
moved  back  into range before the end of the spell duration. After  casting,
the  wizard  must  use his hands in order to manipulate the  motions  of  the
Wyvern,  and  her  Dexterity will affect the believability  of  the  illusion
according to the following chart:

The  wizard transfers memorised spells to his familiar. The wizard loses  use
of  one  spell from the spell level of the spell imbued to the familiar.  The
level and number of spells imbued depend on how many "imbue" spells have been
cast on the familiar (not cumulative).

      The  object that this spell is cast upon is imbued with the ability  to
deliver  the effects of one touch-based spell subsequently cast upon it.  The
caster  must  handle the item completely for the entire round this  spell  is
cast,  and must then cast a touch-based spell and touch the item. This second
spell  takes effect on the next creature to come in contact with  the  object
who is not already touching it.

     Thus, a wizard could cast imbue with touch upon an arrow, hand the arrow
to  his  fighter  companion, cast shocking grasp upon  the  item,  while  the
fighter  holds  his shot until after the wizard has touched the  arrow,  thus
imbuing  it  with  the  shocking power. Then, when the fighter  releases  the
arrow,  the  creature  it strikes receives not only  arrow  damage,  but  the
effects of the shocking grasp as well.

The  material component for this spell is a specially prepared oil,  used  to
anoint the object being imbued with the touch power.

This  spell is similar in nature to change self (q.v.), but allows the wizard
to  assume the form of a specific creature. There is, however, a chance  that
the  form  will not be accurately imitated, with some inconsistency or  fault
being noticed by the observers. The chance of an observer detecting this ruse
is as follows:

     Observer's Familiarity   Base Chance of Modifier for
     With Assumed Form   Detection*     Wizard's Familiarity
     Very well known     25%  -5%
     Seen often     15%  +0%
     Seen occasionally   10%  +10%
     Seen once 5%   +20%
     Never seen     0%   Not applicable
*  This is also the chance of a creature recognising a non-specific form as a
false one.

Additional Modifiers:
          +5% per level of the viewer
          -5% per level of the wizard
          +20% if listener attempts to determine authenticity
          +10% if only seen occasionally
          +5% if seen once or never seen
          -1% per one foot of distance
The chance of detection should be rolled upon initial contact, once for every
three  turns of exposure or one turn of direct conversation, and once for  an
attempt   to  determine  authenticity.  The  spell  may  not  be  immediately
recognised as an illusion, even if a fault is detected, for it could be  seen
as a disguise or a physical change (as with a doppleganger). Note that strong
physical  contact  could reveal the spell, as the illusion  is  only  visual.
Also,  unless  a  voice  spell  is also used,  observers  could  become  very
suspicious.  The size of the alteration can be 50% of actual. Note  that  the
change  is  entirely  illusionary (unlike alter self) -  no  actual  physical
properties are gained whatsoever and special abilities (gaze attacks,  horror
effects, etc.) cannot be reproduced so as to have these special effects.

This spell is capable of returning a creature down the evolutionary scale  to
a  form which would be considered a base ancestor of the creature. It can  be
cast in combat or a laboratory situation.
In the laboratory, where the wizard is able to have the specimen under strict
observation and control, the spell scans the creature for any and all aspects
which  can be described as a product of evolution or environment in any form,
whether  normal  or  magical. This includes Strength,  Intelligence,  Wisdom,
Constitution,  Dexterity,  organizational  habits,  activity   level,   diet,
alignment, natural Armour Class, movement speeds and forms, Hit Dice, natural
fighting  skills (THAC0, number of and attacks and the damage per  attack  in
game  terms), special attacks, special defences, magic resistance, size, grow
patterns  (for example, a frog begins as an egg, becomes a tadpole, polliwog,
and  finally a frog), and spellcasting ability. Also, the caster is  able  to
determine  what  the lowest base form of the creature would be  like  if  all
abilities were reverted back to the most common ancestor of a varied species.
So, all dragons would eventually become some prehistoric lizard, horses would
become miniature prehistoric ponies, etc.
The  laboratory  version has a casting time of one round initially  plus  one
round  for  every  single item listed above which the wizard  would  like  to
discover  (though  DMs  may want to expand on this).  During  the  laboratory
casting  no saving throw is allowed to avoid the analysis of the creature  in
question and magic resistance is reduced by a factor equal to twice the level
of the casting wizard. The creature must be held in relative security so that
the  wizard will not be disturbed by any distractions during the casting.  An
initial check against any magic resistance either avoids the entire spell  or
allows it to function.
At  the end of the analysis the wizard may force the creature to revert  back
to  a base form of its evolutionary scale. However, the surgical abilities of
this spell allows the wizard to selectively alter the above listed aspects of
the  creature  to conform to his analogy of what he would like  removed.  For
example, if a wizard somehow captured an adult dragon and was able to analyze
it, he would reduce its strength to that of a small lizard, but then he would
have  the problem of a multi-tonnage creature who was unable to life its  own
weight  unless he also reduced its size. The caster is able to alter 1 aspect
for  every  3 levels of experience at a rate of 1 per round. Any interruption
of  the  spell  during the alterations leaves the creature at  the  state  it
retained  in the previous round. The creature in question receives  a  saving
throw  versus  spell  at -4 every round a reversion is  attempted  (although,
saving  throws  based  upon Hit Dice may change during the  casting  of  this
spell). Success versus a change in one round does not prevent the wizard from
attempting the same change the next round.
The  combat  version of this spell is somewhat more haphazard. It allows  the
wizard to point at a creature and state a number of reversions which he would
like  to  take  effect, up to a maximum of 3. The analysis phase  is  totally
bypassed  and  the changes take effect in the next round. Backlash  from  the
bypass  automatically stuns the caster for 1d10 rounds and  he  must  make  a
successful  saving  throw  versus spell or be knocked  unconscious  for  1d10
turns. The creature must make a successful saving throw versus spell at -4 to
avoid  the  effects of reversion. Magic resistance is checked with a  penalty
equal  to twice the caster's level of experience. Whether or not the creature
saves,  it will be stunned for the same amount of time as the caster. The  DM
should  make  a quick list of possible changes and insert random changes  for
requested  ones  which would not fit the logical reversion of  the  creature.
Just  remember  that taking away breath weapons might just  make  a  creature
angry!
Surgical  removal can be very selective. Ability scores may only  be  lowered
and reversions should never change more than a single aspect or attribute per
round.  Movement requiring wings may be stripped in one round, but the  wings
would  take another round to remove. Ability scores can be reduced by  1  per
round.  Size  can be reduced by a maximum of 10% per round. Hit points  could
not be affected, though Hit Dice could, therefore lowering the hit points  of
a  creature. Claw attacks could be altered so as to cause a mere 1  point  of
damage  per  strike, or removed altogether (the creature simply  forgets  the
attack  form ever existed). The spell makes no moral alterations  and  cannot
change  attitudes concerning a certain idea. But, alignments can  be  altered
one  step  per round towards a neutral as The final product does not register
as  being  a polymorphed creature (it is a true creature of the form  it  now
embraces) and as such is unaffected by dispel magic. Devolution can also tell
if a creature has been the target of the 7th-level evolution spell, 9th-level
immediate evolution spell, or any other genetic advancing spells. It  may  be
used  to  specifically  counteract  these effects,  essentially  returning  a
creature  to its normal state. DMs should be free to play with the sanity  of
experiment subjects.

The material component of this spell is a vial of aqua vitae (the essence  of
life),  which  can  only be made by a master alchemist.  Aqua  vitae  may  be
purchased  at the nominal price of 10,000 gp per vial due to its  rarity  and
usefulness in creating artificial life forms. Laboratory, for means  of  this
spell,  simply means a non-combat situation. The source of this spell is  the
Telnorne Mageocrat.

This  spell  is used to transfer the "immortal" status of another  individual
into  the caster. It must be cast within the vicinity of an immortal  who  is
either unconscious from wounds, soul trapped, or dying from poison; in  other
words, defenceless but not quite dead.
There are nine immortals in existence at one time: one for each alignment. An
immortal can be of any race, and walks the earth as others of its kind. Also,
an immortal is not an avatar. When an immortal dies, there is no specific god
attached to it, that would in turn die also.
Normally when one immortal is killed, the major god of that alignment  sphere
chooses  another mortal to take the deceased place. The spell takes away  the
godly decision, and forces the immortal powers into the caster. However,  one
cannot  become  the  immortal of a given alignment  unless  one  is  of  that
alignment. If a wizard casts the spell in the presence of a dying immortal of
a different alignment, the spell does not function, and the major god of that
alignment will definitely punish the caster.
If  the  situation is appropriate and the spell is cast correctly, the caster
must  make  a  successful  system  shock roll.  If  the  shock  roll  is  not
successful, the caster dies immediately. If the shock roll is successful, the
previous  immortal dies and the caster becomes an immortal with the following
abilities:
          Immortals do not age. They are not affected by ageing from casting,
or  being  the  recipient  of,  certain spells (wish,  gate,  or  haste,  for
example).
           Immortals have a magic resistance to any magical effect  of  ninth
level or less. The magic resistance is 3% per level + 1% per point of Wisdom.
           Immortals  receive  a +2 to all saving throws.  Furthermore,  they
always  get  a  saving throw to any spell below tenth level. For  example,  a
magic  missile  spell (q.v.) cast at an immortal would  allow  the  target  a
saving throw versus every missile.
           Immortals are not affected by the innate aura effects of  any  god
(i.e. charm, fear, hopelessness, suggestion, peace).
           Immortals exist on a broader "length" of linear time than  mortals
and  therefore have a limited sight into the events of the next three rounds.
The  benefits of this "sight" are a +3 to Armour Class, surprise  rolls,  and
the saving throw bonus mentioned.
           Finally,  an immortal's mind cannot be scanned by any means  (ESP,
know  alignment,  etc.).  However, an immortal's  abilities  do  not  prevent
scrying, though it may be possible for an individual of this calibre to  have
additional protections.
It  is a common belief by players who watch too many movies, that an immortal
can  only be killed by having his head severed. This is not true. An immortal
can  be  killed by any normal means, as long as the means surpasses  all  the
additional defences that immortals are entitled to.

This  power works just like immovability, but it's used  on  other
people  or  objects.  The person or object becomes  immovable  and
will require a large amount of force to move it form its spot.   A
person that has been made immovable is also unable to move himself
without the psionicist allowing it by discontinuing the power.
      Moving the person or object will require a combined strength
total  that  is  at  least 10 times greater  than  the  psionicist
immovability other power score (Con -5).  If an individual  has  a
strength  of  move the 10 times the psionicist immovability  other
power  score  (Con  -5) he can not be held  by  this  power.   See
Immovability  page 61 of The Complete Psionics Handbook  for  more
details.

Power Score:  Moving the person or object becomes impossible.

20:  The psionicist can't stop the power; he maintains it until he
runs out of PSPs.

      This  cantrip allows the wizard to impersonate any speaker with  nearly
perfect  ability. The wizard can only speak in languages he knows,  and  must
possess a small item recently in close proximity to the original speaker (for
example,  an  article of clothing). The wizard's audience  will  probably  be
greatly amused if they can see who is speaking, or completely fooled if  not.
The material component is a mirror, which is consumed in the casting.

This spell allows the caster to implant one magical device into another being
or  himself for full effect. Weapons cannot be implanted, and there  must  be
space  in  the body for the item. Gloves can be sunken under the skin,  rings
placed  around  ribs,  etc. Only one item per 5 Constitution  points  can  be
implanted.

      This spell enables the spell caster to render one creature, himself  or
otherwise, impotent (incapable of sexual intercourse). The material component
is a bucket of cold water. The incantation consists of a specific personality
(such  as  "Baba Yaga") who might be unappealing to the creature. The  saving
throw  is  actually a check on the disgust the personality generates  in  the
creature.  If  the creature finds the person repulsive, he fails  the  saving
throw.

Optional effect: during the period of impotence, the creature will attack  at
-2  and  make  morale  and  saving throws at -2.  Wisdom,  Constitution,  and
Charisma scores are lowered by 1d3 points each for the duration of the spell.
Also, during this time the creature will feel downright miserable.

This  spell  creates life and, according to some mythos, a  new  soul,  in  a
creature capable of bearing young. Its reverse, abort, destroys unborn  life.
The casting of these spells upon a male, though theoretically possible, would
produce  unpredictable effects, although male pregnancy  is  not  impossible.
Casting  this spell on an undead is rumoured to result in the gruesome  death
of both undead and caster. Both of these spells, especially abort, are highly
controversial both for good and for lawful creatures. The material  component
for both is an arrowhead dipped in rabbit's blood.

This  spell impregnates a female creature with a healthy, normal foetus.  The
caster  may choose the foetus's sex. The incubation period for the foetus  is
half of what the normal time would be, but the recipient of the spell will be
in  considerable pain for the first week and last month of this period (i.e.,
there is a  2 to all rolls). The material component for this spells is a  15-
inch smooth obsidian rod.

This  spell  is an improved version of alacrity. It reduces the casting  time
oall  spells  up  to and including seventh level by half (round  down  if  an
initiative modifier unless below 1). Casting times of 1 round are reduced  to
an  initiative modifier of 5; casting times of more than 2 rounds are  halved
with  any fraction giving the modifier in the last round of casting  (a  7th-
level  spell  with 7 rounds of casting is affected, it has 3 full  rounds  of
casting  with  an additional modifier of 5 in the fourth round).  It  is  not
possible  to  reduce casting times to zero with this spell, but it  might  be
combined with other time reducing spells. Any spells up to seventh level cast
during  the  duration of this spell are affected by the reduction of  casting
time.  It  is not possible to affect more than one spell per round with  this
spell. Thus, even if speed casting is used, only one of the two spells may be
reduced  in  its  effective casting time (but it might  be  halved  and  then
reduced by 2 for the speed casting).

The  material  components is one hour glass which was created by  mistake  so
that  its  sands  run a lot faster than normal (lets say by a  factor  of  10
minimum).  This hour glass has to be made from diamonds so it costs  no  less
than 5000 gp.

This  spell  causes  the bones or lifeless bodies of animals,  humanoids,  or
monsters to become animated as skeletons or zombies, capturing the spirits of
the  slain and enslaving them into an existence which lies in a nether sphere
between  life  and  death.  These "undead" can be controlled  by  the  priest
through short, simple commands. Note that once the spell is cast, the  priest
no longer needs to concentrate to maintain control over the undead.

This  spell  is identical to the 1st-level armour, although it  provides  its
wearer  AC  2.  The improved armour lasts until dispelled  or  until  it  has
received 16 HP + 2 HP per level of the wizard worth of damage.
Note: The armour does not absorb damage nor is it ordinarily visible. It will
work with a shield (fighter/mages only), Dexterity bonuses, and other magical
protection  devices,  like  rings of protection  and  cloaks  of  protection,
although it will not protect a creature wearing artificial armour. Artificial
armour includes all manufactured armours, but does not include skin or  hides
that are a natural part of the creature to be protected.

The material component is a small piece of finely cured blessed leather which
the  wizard  must rub all over his body while casting. Note: the  leather  is
reusable.

#9#
This  spell is an improved version of the usual audible glamour.  It  can  be
used  to  create  understandable speech, but only those  languages  that  the
caster  can speak. The volume of sound is the same as the normal version  but
it  can reach the volume of up to 10 dragons roaring at the same time at  the
maximum  of sixtieth level (not that many characters would reach that  level,
though).  Reminder: a dragon roaring equals 24 men shouting at their  loudest
and a wizard gains the power to create sounds equal to four men per level. If
the  sound  volume reaches 2 dragons, this spell starts to  cause  damage  to
characters:  12  hit points at 48 men volumes plus one hit point  per  4  men
volumes  above  that per round in the sound area. The cone  extends  directly
from  the  point of origin which has to be within range. It causes structural
damage  in  the following relation: 1 structural point per 10 hit  points  of
character damage.

The  material components are a small silver horn plus a paper describing  the
sound in the most minute detail (it has to be understood by character who can
read musical notes).

This  spell will cause any humanoid to regard the wizard as a trusted  friend
and  ally to be heeded and protected. Although this does not grant the wizard
the  ability to command the affected humanoid as a robot, it does assure that
anything  the wizard says to the affected creature will be taken in the  most
favourable  way. If the initial saving throw is made, the creature  will  not
realize  that a spell had been cast on him. Otherwise, the affected  creature
must  recheck  his saving throw versus spell once per (20-Intelligence)  days
until  the  spell is broken (creatures with a twenty or greater  Intelligence
are not affected).
It is, however, possible to double or triple charm creatures, so even if they
break  the first charm, they must still contend with others (for the  purpose
of  saving throws, each charm is handled separately from the others). It  has
been  known,  however, for members of the opposite sex to on occasion  become
amorously  attracted  to the wizard, thus continuing the charm  indefinitely.
The  wizard  may  negate the charm at any time, unless  such  attraction  has
occurred.  One dispel magic will break all the charms on a creature,  and  if
the  wizard attempts to harm the charmed creature, this will also  break  the
magic. To further confuse matters, a creature may become charmed to more than
one wizard.

#9#
This  spell is similar to the 1st-level priest spell ring of hands  (add  all
levels  of  wizards in the circle to the benefiting wizard's level for  spell
casting  and memorising effects only) plus the added effect: the circle  does
not  have  to  see the wizard that is to benefit from the spell.  Thus,  this
spell  can be used over a long distance. Each and every wizard in the  circle
has  to  cast  the improved circle to make the circle work. This spell  works
through  the  telepathic link set up by the material component  (see  below).
This   telepathic   link   makes  the  caster   especially   susceptible   to
enchantment/charm  type spells - unless immune to such  spells  due  to  high
Wisdom  or  item effects. The spell's effect does not span planes.  It  lasts
until one of the wizards in the circle is disturbed in his concentration, one
of  the  wizards steps out of the circle, or the benefiting wizard  ends  the
spell  voluntarily.  Note: the benefiting wizard may be  hurt,  feebleminded,
slain,  resurrected, polymorphed or whatever, but his contact with the circle
is  not  broken  unless his body leaves the same plane or his  own  stone  is
broken or somebody real powerful interrupts the telepathic link (the smallest
of small chances, as this spell even goes through a mythal effect).

The  material  component is a stone with a permanent Rary's mindlink  on  it.
These  stones can be reused many times unless stolen or worn away  by  normal
use.  Each  wizard in the circle needs his own stone to make  the  circle  of
wizards complete.

This  is  an improved conjure elemental designed to lower the risks  of  that
spell.  In most respects, it is similar to the 5th-level spell. However,  the
elemental will have 12 HD, and there is only a 1% chance per round  that  the
elemental  will break free of its control. As well, the wizard  can  maintain
concentration  even  if  wounded or grappled if he  can  save  versus  breath
weapon.  Finally,  every three rounds the wizard can cast another  spell  and
still maintain control of the elemental.

This  spell  is  similar  to continual light (q.v.) except  that  it  can  be
controlled to move and can be formed by the wizard into nearly any shape. The
light is stronger than that of the continual light spell. It can blind easily
(with  an effective power of ¬ power word, blind (q.v.), in duration as  well
as in levels or HitDice affected). The chance of being permanently blinded is
only  5% - otherwise, the blindness is only temporary. The light can be aimed
as  a  sort of "flashlight". This spell can be reversed to improved continual
darkness (which will negate the spell). A continual darkness (the reverse  of
an ordinary continual light) will not affect this spell.

This  spell  enables  the priest to sense the aura of goodness.  Diviners  of

auras.  Diviners of seventh level and above may concentrate the  spell  on  a
single  individual, sensing the name of that individual's god (if  good)  and
noting  the level of devotion that person holds toward the god and the  state
of favour the individual has achieved.

This  spell  is  used  to  advance the target up the  evolutionary  scale  of
development,  whether  real or imaginary. It can  be  cast  in  combat  or  a
laboratory situation.
In the laboratory, where the wizard is able to have the specimen under strict
observation and control, the spell scans the creature for any and all aspects
which  can  be  described as a product of evolution. This includes  Strength,
Intelligence,   Wisdom,   Constitution,  Dexterity,  organizational   habits,
activity  level, diet, alignment, natural Armour Class, movement  speeds  and
forms,  Hit  Dice, natural fighting skills (THAC0, number of and attacks  and
the  damage  per  attack in game terms), special attacks,  special  defences,
magic resistance, size, grow patterns (for example, a frog begins as an  egg,
becomes  a tadpole, polliwog, and finally a frog), and spellcasting  ability.
Also,  the caster is able to determine what intrinsic capabilities  could  be
improved   to  change  the  creature  through  an  advancement  of   possible
evolutionary development. This means that lizards could become dragons (of  a
sort),  ponies could become horses, horses could become griffins, hippogriffs
or pegasi.
The  laboratory version has a casting time of one round plus  one  round  for
every  single  item  listed above which the wizard  would  like  to  discover
(though DMs may want to expand on this). During this time no saving throw  is
allowed  to  avoid  the analysis of the creature in question,  although,  the
creature  must be held in relative security so that the wizard  will  not  be
disturbed  by  any distractions during the casting. An initial check  against
any magic resistance either avoids the entire spell or allows it to function.
At  the end of the analysis the wizard may force the creature to move forward
upon   a   possible   evolutionary  scale  which  could  alter   or   develop
characteristics not previously owned. The possible changes are  immeasurable.
DMs  need to assure that changes are built upon a reasonable framework. While
giving  a  bird  the powers of a phoenix may be nice, unless the  wizard  has
prior specific knowledge of a phoenix's extraordinary powers (through use  of
this  spell's  analysis) he has no chance of duplicating the  abilities.  The
caster  is  able to alter 1 aspect for every 3 levels of experience possessed
at  a  rate  of  1  per  round. Any interruption  of  the  spell  during  the
alterations leaves the creature at the state it was in on the previous round.
The  creature must make a successful saving throw versus spell at -4  against
the change as it happens: each change requires a saving throw. Success versus
a  change  does not mean that the wizard cannot try the same change the  next
round.
Using  the  bird  for an example, let's say that we have a  large  bird  that
normally fishes for its food by diving at the water for fish. Based upon  the
imaginary possibilities we could give the bird the ability to breath water or
flight  through water to make fishing a little easier. The wizard would  have
to  effect  two separate changes to achieve both effects. Now, if  we  had  a
human  subject that lives in a faerie woodland we could give him the  ability
to use aspects of other creatures in the woods. If we knew that the dryads in
the  woods had the ability to plant door we could even apply this ability  to
the  human in question. If we changed a horse into a pegasus, though,  simply
giving  it wings does not give it the ability to fly. That instinct  requires
another aspect slot to be used.
The  combat  version of this spell is somewhat more haphazard. It allows  the
wizard  to  point  at a creature and state a number of alterations  which  he
would  like  to  take  effect, up to a maximum of 3. The  analysis  phase  is
totally bypassed and the changes take effect in the next round. Backlash from
the bypass automatically stuns the caster for 1d10 rounds and he must make  a
successful  saving  throw  versus spell or be knocked  unconscious  for  1d10
turns. The creature must make a successful saving throw versus spell at -4 to
avoid  the effects of alteration. Magic resistance is checked with a  penalty
equal  to twice the caster's level of experience. Whether or not the creature
saves,  it will be stunned for the same amount of time as the caster. The  DM
should  allow changes to take effect, but must base their creation on logical
steps  which would normally be required in the laboratory version  (note  the
pegasus example above).
Changing a creature does not necessarily cause it to be charmed or enthralled
by  the  caster. Even if you turn it into a slobbering idiot or a genius  the
creature  will  not  automatically become loyal to the caster.  Although,  an
inventive  wizard  could make the creature fixated with a ritual  or  concept
which  would  make  the wizard the central aspect of the creature's  heritage
(such  as  a  totem or deity), thereby assuring the creature  is  predisposed
rather well to the wizard's commands.
This  spell  can also tell if a person has been the target of  the  7th-level
Devolution spell, 9th-level Immediate Devolution spell, or any other  genetic
retarding  or  decreasing spells. It may be used to  specifically  alter  the
effects,  essentially  returning the creature to a  normal  state.  Also,  no
ability  score  may  be raised more than 2 points above the  previous  racial
maximum and never more than a score of 22.

The material component of this spell is a vial of aqua vitae (the essence  of
life),  which  can  only be made by a master alchemist.  Aqua  vitae  may  be
purchased  at the nominal price of 10,000 gp per vial due to its  rarity  and
usefulness in creating artificial life forms. Laboratory, for means  of  this
spell,  simply means a non-combat situation. The source of this spell is  the
Telnorne Mageocrat.

This  spell attracts a familiar to act for the wizard. The wizard may attract
a  familiar  of up to half his Hit Dice. The wizard may specify the  type  of
creature  preferred but not the specific creature. Hence he could specify  "a
cat" but not "Mrs Pike's Ginger Tom".
Furthermore,  the wizard gains the ability to communicate mentally  with  his
familiar  and  to  use  the  senses  of the  familiar  while  this  is  being
concentrated  on. Hence, he can "see" through his familiar's  eyes,  "listen"
with  its ears, etc. No other actions are possible during this concentration.
The range for this communication is 5 miles per level of the wizard.
The  wizard gains the hit points of the familiar when it is within  12  feet,
and  on  its death (if not released beforehand), will permanently lose double
the  amount of these hit points (regardless of the distance to the familiar).
If a familiar is in range, it must be of the same alignment as the wizard and
will  then willingly serve its master or mistress as long as it donot involve
a  threat  to  its  life and as long as suitable rewards  are  given  to  the
familiar  at  regular intervals (mice for cats, treasure or  souls  for  more
powerful  creatures).  Failure to provide such suitable  rewards  allows  the
familiar an additional saving throw versus spell (at +1 for each time rewards
have been ignored).
The DM determines the likelihood of the preferred creature being within range
and  determines all results including the type, size, Hit Dice and  abilities
of  the  attracted familiar. The range of the spell is one mile per level  of
the wizard.

The  material components of this spell include feathers, fur or skin etc.  of
the  creature preferred and a total of 100 gp worth of incense and herbs  per
Hit Die of the summoned familiar. The familiar so attracted receives a saving
throw  versus  spell to ignore the summons. The spell may be  attempted  only
once every 6 months.
This  spell is a specialised version of charm person or mammal, and rewarding
the familiar gives a strong chance of an individual offering his services to,
for  example,  a wizard or dragon for quite a period. Both stand  to  benefit
from the co-existence.
By  introducing this spell to a campaign, familiars should be more common  to
all wizards including dragons, drow, etc. It would be quite beneficial for  a
dragon to have a human familiar. The familiar is able to arrange delivery  of
suitable  bribes, slaves, information, treasure or whatever else  the  dragon
would  require. It can always be useful to have such a spy in an enemy  camp.
On  the  same basis, it also means that a powerful witch is able  to  have  a
troll  or doppleganger act as her familiar for several years. In return,  the
familiar gains treasure, knowledge or power or just food and security.
The  reverse  of this spell, release familiar, has a range of  0,  since  the
wizard must be able to touch his familiar to release it. This version of  the
spell has no material component and is permanent. Its casting time is 0,  and
the familiar is not entitled to a saving throw.

As  its  name implies, this is an improved version of the 3rd-level fireball.
It  has  one of two applications as chosen at the time of casting: the  first
option mimics fireball in all respects except that damage is 1d8 per level of
the wizard (up to a maximum of 10d8) and saving throws are at -1.
The second version of the spell has a 10-foot radius instead of the normal 20-
foot.  Due  to this reduced area of effect, damage is increased to  1d10  per
level  of the wizard (up to a maximum of 10d10) and saving throws are at  -2.
It is like fireball in all other respects.

The  material components for this spell are a pinch of and a fire opal of not
less than 200 gp in value.

This  spell  functions the same as lion's claw (cf. Dragon  magazine,  #132),
but,  in addition, the priest's toenails grow and thicken into claws. If  the
priest  scores  two finger claw hits during melee he gains the  advantage  of
raking  with its two foot claws that turn, each rake causing 1d8+3 points  of
damage.  As  with lion's claw, the priest needs some mistletoe and  a  lion's
claw to cast this spell.

Improved  magic  missiles  is actually a family of at  least  three  discrete
variants,  each optimised to enhance one characteristic of the spell:  number
of  missiles, damage, or range. If an improved magic missiles spell is found,
roll 1d100 on the following table:

     D100 Roll Result
     01-10     Range
     11-55     Numbers
     56-99     Damage
     00   Two spells, roll again

Range:  this rare spell doubles the range of magic missile to well  over  120
yards.  Ideal  for use against flying enemies. One in twenty copies  of  this
spell inflict 1d6+1 points of damage.
Numbers: range and damage are as per the magic missile. The wizard can  evoke
one  missile  per  level,  doubling the number of missiles  created.  A  rare
variant  (5%)  inflicts  1d3  points of damage, but  grants  the  wizard  two
missiles per level.
Damage:  the  spell is identical to magic missile, except that  the  missiles
inflict 2d4+2 points of damage a piece. 30% of the copies of this spell are a
weaker  variant  which inflict 1d6+1 points of damage per  missile,  but  are
otherwise identical to the 1st-level spell.

This spell is a much more powerful version of mirror image. Not only are more
images (1d6 + 1 per 2 levels) created, but they last longer, and the ruse can
only  be  detected with a gem of true seeing or similar device. The phantasms
are  solid for all intents and purposes, taking damage when attacked  instead
of  winking out. A wand of negation or dispel magic will destroy only one  of
the  phantasms.  The material component is a small mithril mirror  worth  not
less than 500 gp.

This  spell  is similar to the 8th-level permanency but it has the  following
additional effects:
           it  can  be  used  on  any  spell  with  a  duration  longer  than
instantaneous (if the spell was an insspell which was expanded to longer than
instantaneous by whatever means it can be affected) no matter whether area of
effect, personal, touch, etc.;
           it causes the person upon which a spell was made permanent to save
once  per week per improved permanency versus spell at the base saving  throw
(no  bonuses except race); if failed, the person loses one Constitution point
permanently;
           items  which  are made permanent with this spell get  an  improved
saving throw against Mordenkainen's disjunction or similar destructive spells
(either  the  level of the caster is doubled and this used as the  base  from
which  destruction  is  determined,  or the  item's  saving  throw  is  used,
whichever is better);
          spells made permanent by this spell are not automatically dispelled
if  the appropriate means are used successfully to bring them down (like  the
spells required for a prismatic sphere or wall spell) but the spells get  the
base  saving throw of the caster to resist dispelling (this even  applies  to
such means as Mordenkainen's disjunction or dispel magic).
The  game  effects:  the  spell draws half the caster's  Constitution  points
permanently,  it  draws  one  experience  level  of  the  finger's   creature
permanently  (as  though  the  level had  never  been  there:  it  cannot  be
restored),  the  spell  requires the body parts  freshly  taken,  not  stored
somewhere or something like that.

The  material component is a completely non-magically created candle  of  six
feet length and over one foot diameter. It has to be inlaid with a finger  of
the caster and one quart of blood of the recipient creature (if there is one:
otherwise  a  quart  of blood from the caster if it is an  item  to  be  made
permanent). The finger and the blood have to be freshly given as  they  still
need  to  contain  a part of the creature's life force and  experience.  This
candle is lit during the casting but is not consumed by it. It does not  burn
up  during time as it is the material component of this spell. It has to burn
like  a normal candle. As long as it burns, the spell which is made permanent
by  this  spell  is also permanent. The candle can be extinguished  like  any
other  normal  candle. It cannot be ensorcelled directly but the  surrounding
area in which it stands can be enspelled as desired. The candle does not have
to  be  carried  with the item or person which is made permanent.  This  link
works throughout all planes, through any barriers, in a mythal (except  in  a
mythal  which specifically prohibits this specific spell), and even into  the
phlogiston (as long as the candle burns).

This  spell works like a permanent advanced illusion with an included  bonus:
it  starts  to  have  touch components as well. Thus, it  could  be  used  to
simulate  something a character can touch in the illusion (even in disbelief)
and actually feel the illusion without the illusion vanishing. If a character
states  that he disbelieves he gets a saving throw versus spell at -4 due  to
the  power of the spell if that character actually touches the illusion -  it
does  not  work if he just sees it. If he succeeds, he can pass  through  the
illusion, but the illusion does not vanish for him. If they still disbelieve,
they  can attempt a second saving throw versus spell at their normal chances.
If  they succeed again, they completely disbelieve the illusion. If they fail
at  one of their saving throws they stay at their current state of belief  or
disbelief. Thus, if they failed at their first saving throw, they could still
touch and feel the illusion (with all the consequences that entails). If they
failed their second saving throws they could pass through the illusion but it
would  still  exist as a very good hologram for them - and they  would  still
take damage if it were the illusion of for example a wall of ice.

The  material components are a small sample of the material normally used  to
create the real article to be created by the illusion plus a small opaque gem
polished  to  mirror  smoothness which has to be so thin has  to  transparent
again.

This  spell, like its 4th-level counterpart, draws on the inner fears of  the
victim's  subconscious mind to create a terrifying monster that only  he  can
see. The killer has all the abilities of its lower level cousin. However,  it
attacks twice per round as a 6 HD creature, hitting any Armour Class on a  19
or 20.
The  defence for this spell is the same as for the 4th-level version.  Having
been attacked by that spell does not grant a bonus to this one. If the killer
is disbelieved, the wizard has a 4% chance per level of turning it onto a new
victim.  This chance drops to 3% per level for a third victim, 2%  per  level
for a fourth, and 1% per level for a fifth. The killer can also be turned  to
a  new  victim  if  it kills its current one. If any of the turning  attempts
fail, the killer is dispelled.
If  the killer is turned on its creator (by a reflection, for example),  that
wizard gets a +2 on a possible attempt to disbelieve. Anyone who reverses the
killer cannot direct it to any other victims except the original caster.

This spell is similar to the 2nd-level sense shifting spell from the Tome  of
Magic,  but  it can affect any spells cast in its duration but it can  affect
spells  of first to third level with two sense shiftings at once (sounds  can
be completely turned off but still no understandable speech) and 4th- to 6th-
level spells with one sense shifting.

The material component is a small silver tablet which is covered with a fresh
coat of heavily soaped and perfumed water so it scintillates in all colours.

This  spell is similar to the other two sense shifting spells, but this spell
has  a  much greater power: it can be given to another creature by touch  and
the  creature  may give it back or to another by touch (only if desired,  but
only  one creature can have the spell effects active at one time); the  spell
affects 1st- to 3rd-level spells in all senses, including completely quieting
sound,  or  providing  understandable speech (or  even  song),  changing  the
quality  of  sense to another (a fireball might be changed to an iceball)  to
the senses only - note that their effect stays the same (and a fireball still
cannot affect a fire elemental even if its sense is shifted into an iceball);
4th-  to 6th-level spells can be changed in 3 senses (to be completely silent
in their effect - not their verbal casting), and 7th- to 9th-level spells can
be changed similar to the original 3rd-level spell.

The material component is a freshly picked lotus blossom which is immersed in
a  mithril  bowl of no less than 3 feet diameter which contains 5 gallons  of
aqua  regia  which  has  to  have a thick (approximately  «  inch)  layer  of
concentrated  non-magical rose oil on top of it. As the  aqua  regia  quickly
dissolves the rose oil this has to be continuously reapplied during the whole
casting time. The whole arrangement is destroyed during the casting. The bowl
costs  no  less than 15,000 gp. Where you get a freshly picked lotus  blossom
from  is  your problem. The worst problems you will get from those  gardeners
which  won't  give  up their roses (a « inch layer of concentrated  rose  oil
which is 3 feet in diameter is approximately a whole years worth of rose  oil
from  a  whole planet (of normal planet that is). This does not  include  the
cost for the laboratory equipment to produce 5 gallons of aqua regia (and  it
also  does not contain the cost for the new lungs you will have to buy  after
standing  in  a room which contains 5 gallons of opened, highly concentrated,
smoking aqua regia with no good ventilation in the room for a casting time of
one hour).

This  spell  duplicates  the effect of vocalize for several  persons  over  a
longer duration. The persons have to touch each other when the spell is cast.
The  caster has to touch one of them to give the spell to those in the circle
who  he chooses. With this spell the recipients can choose whether they  want
their  spells to have verbal spell components or not. The caster  can  affect
one person for every five levels he has earned.

The material component of this spell is one clapper-less bell for each person
to be affected by the spell.

      By  means  of  this  spell, all sounds made  by  the  recipient  become
inaudible - breathing, talking, walking, and the like. Items on the  wizard's
person are likewise silenced, but thrown or dropped items may make noise once
released. While under the effect of this spell, the affected creature  cannot
cast  any  spells  with a verbal component. An unwilling  victim  receives  a
saving throw against this spell.

      Unlike a silence spell, inaudibility masks only the sounds made by  the
recipient or items in his possession, so it provides no defense against sound
based  attacks  such  as harpy singing, a horn of blasting,  etc.  The  spell
remains  in effect until it is magically dispelled, until the wizard  or  the
recipient  cancels it, or until its duration has passed; it is not  dispelled
by  the recipient attacking another creature. The spell can only be cancelled
by the recipient if the wizard has stated so when the spell was cast.

The material component for this spell is a small wad of cotton.

This  spell  causes  the towing capability of a helm  to  be  increased.  The
casting  time  is  dependent on the ship's weight in tons  which  exceed  the
normal  towing  capacity of the helm. It is possible to increase  the  towing
capacity of a helm by multiple castings of this spell (at once or in sequence
does  not  matter). Thus, it would be possible to significantly increase  the
towing capacity of a helm. Thus, if a casting time of 3 hours were to be used
it  would be possible to increase the towing capacity of a minor helm to  110
tons (20 tons per hour). It does not increase the helm's speed.
The reversed spell, decrease helm power, causes the towing capacity of a helm
to  be reduced by 1 ton per three rounds casting time. If the towing capacity
of  the  helm  falls below the ship's tons it does not function.  It  can  be
dispelled with a dispel magic.

The  material component is the bone of a giant and a potion of giant strength
for  each  ton  of ship to be increased. For the reverse, a scroll  with  one
enfeeblement spell per ton is needed.

This  spell  causes  a ghostly, glowing hand, shaped from the  wizard's  life
force,  to materialise within the spell range and move as the wizard desires.
Any  touch attack spell of sixth level or less that is subsequently  cast  by
the  wizard can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell attacks  as  the
wizard  at a +2 bonus to-hit. The wizard may perform other actions. The  hand
is  AC  -3  and may be hit by magic only. Any damage dispels it and does  1d6
points  to the wizard. The material component of this spell is a hand,  which
is consumed in the casting.

This  is the opposite power of Inflict Pain.  While no good  comes
from  it  (no  healing or curative effects), it makes the  subject
individual  shudder and twist in ecstasy.  If used in combat,  the
victim must save vs paralyzation in order to keep functioning  and
fighting.  Failure to save indicates a penalty of -4 on all attack
rolls that round, and any spells being cast are disrupted.
      The insidious effects of this power occur when it is used in
conjunction   with  Inflict  Pain.   By  using  the   two   powers
interchangeably, dependent upon the victim's actions,  the  victim
can  be conditioned to perform certain acts instead of other  acts
they would normally perform.  For each week of being subjected  to
this  treatment,  they must make a wisdom check,  with  a  penalty
equal  to  the number of weeks of "treatment" (i.e.,  3  weeks  of
treatment  =  penalty of -3) or have their actions  in  particular
scenarios predetermined by their conditioning.  Only one  area  of
behavior  may be affected per victim.  Depending upon the behavior
modification, there is a chance (DM's discretion) for an alignment
change by the victim.

Power  Score:   The pleasure is so overwhelming  that  the  victim
passes out for 1d10 rounds.

20:  The contact is broken.

This  spell  allows the wizard to freeze one creature or  object  up  to  100
pounds  per level, limit regardless of orientation. Creatures flying  through
the  air would be frozen in place (remaining in the air), immovable until the
second  command word. The wizard is free to cast this spell upon himself.  If
the  subject  of  the spell is unwilling, it receives a saving  throw  versus
paralysation, a successful saving throw negating.
The wizard must point at the creature or object to be stopped, and utters the
first  command word. If the spell is successful (guaranteed in  the  case  of
objects  within the wizard's weight limit), the item is frozen  in  the  air,
immovable, unless a dispel magic, or other such spell is cast, or  until  the
wizard  utters the second command word. Upon saying the second command  word,
the  object or creature resumes its initial motion. For example, cast upon  a
falling chest, would stop the chest in the air. Upon the second command,  the
chest would resume falling, even if someone had climbed on top of it. If some
poor  slob happened to be standing directly beneath the chest at the time  of
the second command... If cast at a knight on a horse, for example, the wizard
must  specify mount or rider. If cast at the mount, the rider would  probably
continue  in  his  original direction, just without his mount.  Cast  on  the
rider, he would stay hanging in the air, as his mount ran away.
Physical  force  is insufficient to move frozen objects, so they  could,  for
example,  be used as anchors for ropes, etc. The wizard must be able  to  see
the majority of the object of the spell, so he couldn't, for example, cast it
upon something in somebody's backpack.

The material component of the spell is a silver whistle, which is blown prior
to shouting the command word.

This  is  similar  to an inertial barrier, but  with  one  crucial
difference:  the  field is compressed, giving  greater  protection
from frontal attacks. It protects a 120 degree arc in front of the
psionic,
with coverage curving to reach over his head. (Think of it as  the
front  1/3 of an inertial barrier). To determine the damage,  roll
how  much  damage the missile would have done, then roll twice  as
many  hit dice to determine the shield's protection. If the shield
roll is less than, then subtract it from the missile's damage.  If
the  rolls  are  equal, then the missile simply falls  inside  the
shield  (but  explosions  could  still  injure  those  behind  the
shield).  If  the shield roll is greater than the  missile  damage
roll,  the  missile falls outside the shield, and  any  explosions
will also be absorbed by the shield.
     The inertial shield protects against the same forms of attack
as  the inertial barrier, but is less effective in some situations
(like gas attacks, or missiles coming from all directions).

Power Score:  The shield expands into a 180 degree arc at no extra
cost, or into 270 degree arc for 6 points per round.

20:   The  shield  works in reverse, doubling the damage  done  by
missiles.

This  spell  will cause any wounds to become infected, be they  scratches  or
large  wounds. Wizards do not need to hit their intended victims. The  victim
must make a saving throw versus death magic, and if he fails, his wounds will
not  heal  naturally.  Healing and herbalism will also  fail  to  heal  these
wounds. The use of magical healing will heal the infection, at the cost of  a
cure light wounds - no damage will be healed, but the infected wounds will be
negated.  The material component for this spell is a powdered opal of  10  or
more gold pieces value.

While the wizard is casting this spell, a dark ominous cloud begins to gather
in  a 1 mile-diameter region centred over the target. Upon completion of  the
spell,  a dark, fiery tornado of fire grows from the base of the cloud  until
it touches the ground. The whirling mass of fire proceeds to wander about the
area, incinerating everything in its path.
Each  round, the tornado travels in a random direction at a movement rate  of
20.  The  flames inflict 1hp of damage per tenth of a round of  exposure  for
every  level of experience of the spell caster. The diameter of the  cylinder
is  about 50 feet, and anyone within 25 feet must make a Strength check  each
round  to  keep from being sucked into the cylinder by the powerful blast  of
winds.

The material component of this spell is a large iron pot filled with charcoal
that must be kept burning for the duration of the casting. Sulphur and 500 gp
worth of crushed amber must be gradually added to the pot.

      Success  of each is determined as 10% chance of failure for each  level
the victim has higher than the wizard (maximum 99%, minimum 1%). The material

This devotion allows the psionicist to see in darkness, using  the
heat  coming from an object. For all intents and purposes,  it  is
identical to that possessed by elves and dwarves. It extends to 60
feet,  does  not  function in the presence of light,  and  can  be
blinded  by  "hot"  objects. A side effect is  that  any  form  of
ultravision  (being  able to see beyond  the  violet  end  of  the
spectrum)  is  negated  while this power is  in  effect,  and  the
subject  may have difficulty distinguishing colors past  the  blue
end of the spectrum.
      The  power works by shifting the photoreceptors in  the  eye
down  towards  the  red (and infrared) portions of  the  spectrum.
Demihuman psionicists who already have infravision cannot use this
power.

Power Score:  Range increases to 90 feet.

20:   The  character  becomes colorblind and sensitive  to  bright
light for 2-20 rounds.

      When cast, this spell causes the caster to go completely insane for one
round  per level. During this time, the caster is incapable of doing anything
but  babble, giggle, and play with his toes. But also during this  time,  the
caster  is  completely immune to any spell, power, or force that attempts  to
mess  with  his  mind:  ESP,  Charm spells, mind control,  unspeakable  elder
horrors  saying  "Boo!",  and  the like have  no  effect  on  the  character.
Afterwards,  the  character  is  once again completely  normal,  but  has  no
recollection of what happened during the period of insanity.

      Upon  casting this spell, the wizard creates an ink cloud in the water,
similar  to  that  which  an octopus releases. The  cloud  covers  a  20-foot
circular area, either at the casters position or at any location within spell
range. The ink cloud remains stationary for the duration of the spell, unless
cast in moving water (such as a river), where it dissipates in one round. The
cloud  will block all vision, including infravision. When the spell  expires,
the ink cloud vanishes.

The material component of this spell is the eye of an octopus.

      This  spell  causes  its  victim to sound and appear  crude,  insultand
arrogant, in all that is said or done, to all observers. The victim, however,
will  not  be  aware  that anything is amiss. While the  general  meaning  of
whatever is said will be the same, the illusion causes observers to  see  and
hear a twisted version in which the speaker is so insolent that all reactions
are  checked at -50%. Additionally, such speech might not be tolerated at all
in  some situations (for example, automatic dismissal from a king's court, or
perhaps even worse...). Even if the target makes his saving throw, the  spell
will  not be noticed (unless the somatic and verbal components of the  wizard
are seen and recognised).

     If an observer has reason to believe that something is amiss, he gains a
saving throw if an attempt is made to disbelieve. Such a saving throw is made
at  +4  if  the fact that it is an illusion has been communicated.  If  these
saving throws are failed, it still appears real.

The  material component is a bit of dung or spittle, which is wrapped in  the
wizard's hand. The hand is then subtly waived at the creature to be affected.
The verbal component is a low guttural sound made in the throat.

By  means of this spell, the caster may increase the Intelligence of any non-
fantastic animal with animal Intelligence to half the normal Intelligence  of
the  caster (fractions rounded down). This affects the ability of the  animal
to  understand concepts, situations, and commands, and allows for the  animal
to use individual initiative in unforseen circumstances.
This  spell does not grant the animal the power of speech (since few animals'
vocal chords are designed so that they can create human sounds), but when the
spell  is  completed, an Intelligence check should be made for the animal  to
see  if it is able to fully understand the language of the caster. This check
is  made at double Intelligence (so an animal with an Intelligence of 5  must
roll  a 10 or lower on a 1d20 to be able to comprehend the language). If  the
check  fails, then the animal can understand a wide variety of commands,  but
lacks the ability to understand conversations and dialogues.
DM  discretion is allowed here: if the animal is one that would seem to  have
the ability to use human speech (eg., a myna bird), then the DM can rule that
the animal is also capable of conversation.
The  casting  time  of  this  spell  is  two  months:  it  includes  constant
companionship and training, and only one animal at a time can be affected  by
the  druid  or  priest.  A  character with  the  animal  training  non-weapon
proficiency  can reduce the casting time of this spell in half (to  just  one
month). The material component is the food the animal is fed.
Note:  The  animal  must be prepossessed toward the spell caster  before  the
spell  begins. The spell does not affect loyalty, friendship, or anything  of
that  nature.  One may assume, however, that depending upon the treatment  of
the  animal, there would develop a strong bond over the time it takes to cast
this spell.

This  spell  is an extension of the 2nd-level talking mist spell and  can  be
"triggered"  to appear under certain circumstances. The spell  can  summon  a
Class  I  type of intelligent mist from the elemental plane of air.  Once  it
appears,  the  mist  delivers an introductory message, but doesn't  dissipate
immediately  after delivery. It can then stay for its duration  and  converse
with anyone in the area.
The  mist is actually a being from the elemental plane of air (albeit  a  low
powered  one).  The difference between intelligent mists and  other  summoned
creatures  is that the mists actually have access to the knowledge  of  their
summoner.  This  includes 1 language (chosen by the wizard)  and  information
(not spells) dictated by the casting wizard.
For  a detailed description of the different types of intelligent mists,  see
the  monster description provided with the 5th-level magic mist. As with  the
talking mist spell, the material component is the smoke of a burning piece of
paper with the initial message written on it.
Once the spell duration ceases, the mist returns to the plane of air, but  if
the  spell  is "re-triggered" before this happens, the same mist is  summoned
again, with knowledge of previous encounters.

This  power allows the psionicist to exchange physical places with
any  creature within sight, and 50 yards, of the psionicist.   The
creature  cannot be more than 150% of the mass of the  psionicist.
When the interchange takes place, the orientation between the  two
characters  remains the same, so any combat taking  place  between
the  two interchanged characters is unaffected (both physical  and
magical attacks.)
      If  the subject of the interchange power is unwilling to  be
teleported, they are allow a saving throw vs. paralyzation  at  -2
to resist the teleportation effort.  If the creature is willing to
be interchanged, no saving throw is required.
      Note:  In response to a question as to why there is a saving
throw  for  an unwilling target of this power; the Teleport  Other
power  works only an willing or unconscious beings...I  though  it
fair  to  allow  a saving throw for this power if the  victim  was
reluctant to undergo the Interchange.

Power  Score:  The saving throw of the subject of the  interchange
power automatically fails.

20:   The psionicist becomes disoriented, and suffers a -2 to  all
rolls for the next turn.

This  spell  causes the victims' bodies to burst into very hot  flames  which
have their origin within their bodies. The wizard can affect one creature per
round, up to a maximum of one creature per three levels (round down). If  the
wizard  takes  a round to do something else, the remaining potential  of  the
spell  is lost. However, the wizard only has to concentrate during the actual
casting  of the spell, and has an initiative modifier of 3 when attacking  on
subsequent rounds. Any creature attacked is allowed a saving throw  to  avoid
all damage, and is immune to further attacks from this particular casting  of
the  spell. Those who fail their saving throw take 2 hit points of damage per
level of the wizard. On succeeding rounds, the flames continue to burn, doing
1  hit point of damage per level of the wizard. On each of these rounds,  the
creature  is allowed another saving throw (at the beginning of the round)  to
end  the  spell. The flames cannot be put out by any non-magical  means.  Any
creature killed by this spell is completely reduced to ashes by the flames.

      This  spell allows the wizard to increase a person's intoxication state
by  one. Thus, a sober person would become slightly intoxicated, a moderately
intoxicated person would become greatly intoxicated, and so on (see  the  Net
Alcohol Guide for more information).
The  reverse  of  this spell, lessen intoxication, will decrease  a  person's
intoxication state by one. The material component for both versions is a pint
of pure alcohol.

This  spell renders the creature touched invisible to all creatures that have
the  ability to fly. This includes all such creatures, regardless  of  level,
Hit Dice or Intelligence.
Creatures  with the ability to fly include all these that can fly,  hover  or
simply levitate by their own power, without help from another creature.  This
includes  insects, birds or even wizards employing the fly  spell.  Creatures
with  a  "flying" movement rate are always included. It is not necessary  for
the  creature to fly, in order for the spell to affect them. If the  creature
loses the ability to fly during the spell, he will see the recipient.
Creatures with an Intelligence of 17 or higher receive a saving throw  versus
spell to disbelieve the spell automatically.
The  component is 2 gp of gold dust, sprinkled over the recipient. This spell
was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary units are for the
Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

      By  casting this cantrip, the wizard brings into existence a  field  of
force able to write on normal materials with a quill pen. The wizard must sit
quietly  for  the duration of the writing, and simply speaks what  is  to  be
written.  The  invisible  scribe writes in a  handwriting  vaguely  like  the
wizard's in any language the wizard knows how to read. It is fairly slow. The
material component for the spell is ink, which is consumed in the casting.

This spell protects the wizard from all forms of weapons. The spellcaster  is
totally  immune  to non-magical weapons. Magical weapons only inflict  damage
equal  to  their  plus, no strength or specialization bonuses apply.  Natural
weapons  (claws, bite, etc.) inflict -3 hit points per die of damage (with  a
minimum  of  one  point). This spell offers no protection against  spells  or
special  attack  forms,  or  even weapons created by  spells  (Mordenkainen's
sword,  for example). The material component of this spell is a normal  metal
weapon of any sort.

This  spell creates a full-face helmet on the subject's head. The helmet thus
created is in all respects a +1 magical helmet, thus granting the subject all
advantages  and  disadvantages from wearing such a  helmet.  For  example,  a
wizard  would no longer be able to cast spells, a psionicist could no  longer
use  his  powers,  but both would be protected against called  shots  against
their head and receive a +1 to their Armour Class.
If  the  wizard is of at least eleventh level, there is an additional effect:
the helmet has a lock that will lock in the round following the casting. This
can  be  avoided  by  removing the helmet before  the  lock  closes  (make  a
Dexterity check). If the helmet is not removed before the lock closes, it can
only be removed by a Dispel Magic or similar magic. The helmet will disappear
when the duration expires.
Note  that  since  the  target is not himself affected (the  helmet  is  only
created around his head), he receives no saving throw. The material component
for  this spell are a piece of leather and at least two square inches of cast
iron.

This  spell  has a similar effect as stoneskin. It was copied from  the  6th-
level  priest  spell  on  Athas (see the Dark Sun  books).  It  protects  the
recipient  from the damage of weapons, whether magical or normal unless  they
function by touch (like a touch spell). In contrast to stoneskin, this  spell
does  not  lose its efficiency if the weapon would not have hit. It  protects
against  1d6 attacks + 1 attack per 2 levels. Thus, if this spell would  have
been  cast  by a 16th-level wizard, it would protect against 9 to 14  attacks
that  would  have hit - don't deduct those that did not hit (including  those
parried by the character). Thus, if the roll had been 4, the recipient  would
be  protected against a full 12 hits, not against 12 attacks. If he had  been
attacked 20 times but only 10 would have hit, he still would have 2 protected
attacks.

The  material component is a minute full plate armour made from mithril  that
has  been  enchanted with enchant an item and a mending spell. This costs  no
less  than  5000  gp. This spell is not cumulative with  itself,  but  it  is
cumulative with one (and only one) stoneskin.

Causes  the victim to have an irresistible urge to scratch, if it  fails  its
saving  throw.  This  can be cast on any sort of creature  that  is  able  to
scratch,   and   dogs  save  at   4.  This  spell  works  with   embarrassing
effectiveness  on armoured folks. The actual location of the  itch  is  semi-
random (i.e., the DM rolls a dice, pretends it matters, then does whatever he
likes). Most of the time, though, it's on the back, the foot, or, on the  odd
occasion, less appropriate places.

This  spell  offers items carried by someone the possibility to  survive  any
failed saving throws as long as this spell is in effect. It offers protection
for  one  failed  saving throw per 2 levels of the caster.  It  includes  all
effects  of  saving  throws  like  those against  fireball,  lightning  bolt,
disintegration, meteor swarm, crushing blow or any other saving throws  which
the  carrier  fails  to  save  against except  dispel  magic,  Mordenkainen's
disjunction, and sphere of annihilation. The effects above have their  normal
chances to affect or destroy the items as usual.
The spell may also be used to protect items which are not carried by someone.
In  that  case  the  spell has to be placed on the item directly.  It  cannot
benefit from additional protection by an additional casting of this spell  on
the  caster (if the item is protected, it does not gain the protection of the
spell on the carrier, but it still has to save only when the caster fails  to
save).  If the spell is cast on an item directly, it protects from one failed
item  saving throw per 7 levels of the caster (two at fourteenth to twentieth
level,  three  at  twenty-first to twenty-seventh level,  etc.).  Once  these
protections  are used up the item will not receive additional spells  of  the
same kind for one month per failed saving throw.
The  saving throws are used up one by one by failed saving throws. The  items
do  not  need save if their carrier saves unless the spell or effect normally
requires  them to save (the carrier falls 500 feet which causes all items  to
save versus crushing blow).
Both  types of the spell last until the last protection is used up  or  until
100 days per caster level have passed.

The material component is a perfect sphere of adamantine with no hinges which
contains  a  single sheet of paper. On this sheet are written all  the  items
which  are  to be carried and protected by this spell. This can be done  even
with conditions under which new items may be picked up by the carrier so that
they  are  also protected. This paper has to be written in the freshly  taken
blood of the caster (or the carrier) as the spell is cast. Thus, it is a very
rare spell to have around during the normal adventuring time.

By means of this spell, the wizard may transfer the concentration requirement
and  control  ability  of  any illusion spell to the  creature  touched.  The
illusion  spell  must  be cast the next round or this spell  is  wasted.  The
creature touched must posses the intelligence to concentrate and thus control
the  spell.  Non-spellcasters and spellcasters who have never  cast  illusion
spells  will  require  practice  before they can  control  the  illusion.  In
addition,  creatures of low Intelligence will produce low  quality  illusions
that  will  be  easier to detect and disbelieve. Spell control  may  only  be
passed to willing subjects.

The  material  component is a 200 gp worth gem that is given to  the  spell's
subject  by  the wizard at the completion of this spell and before  the  next
spell is cast.

By  means of this spell, the wizard may disguise his mental signature  to  be
identical to another wizard's. All in-place spells react to the wizard as  if
he  were  the  other wizard. For instance, the wizard would be able  to  pass
through  another's wizard locked door, or use another's passwall. The  wizard
would  even  be  able  to  travel  through a priest's  glyph  of  warding  or
forbiddance, provided that the password is known.
Note that some in-place spells such as prismatic sphere are not designed  for
access by two persons. Powerful, in-place, wizard specific spells will not be
fooled  by  the  forgery if their real wizard is present.  While  this  spell
allows  the  wizard  to walk into another one's unoccupied prismatic  sphere,
should the wizard attempt to enter an occupied sphere the attempt will  fail,
resulting in the wizard taking the full consequences of such an attempt.  The
caster of the prismatic sphere will never have a problem entering, however if
the  caster of the sphere enters after the caster of the forgery, the  sphere
will  no longer be deceived by the forgery. If the caster of the forgery then
comes in contact with the sphere he will take the full consequences.
Less  powerful,  in-place, wizard specific spells  either  are  not  specific
enough  to exclude two mental copies of the wizard or will refuse the  second
access attempt even if it is the caster of the original spell.
This  spell does not foil active detection spells such as know alignment  and
true  seeing, only in-place ones. Also, the wizard is not recognised  by  his
own in-place spells for the duration of the forgery.

The  matcomponent of this spell is an ivory plaque on which is inscribed  the
name and magic symbol of the wizard whose aura is to be duplicated.

This  spell  allows  a  wizard  to  maintain  any  illusion  spell  requiring
concentration  without the need to concentrate. The maintained illusion  will
either  remain  fixed,  proceed or repeat in a very  mechanical  manner.  The
wizard  may  alter the behaviour of the maintained illusion at  any  time  by
concentrating  on  changing  the  illusion. Changing  a  maintained  illusion
requires an action of length equal to twice the original casting time of  the
illusion.  Disruption of the changing action causes the end of the maintained
spell. The wizard can maintain one spell per four levels.

The material component is a gem worth 200 gp for each spell to be controlled.

By  means  of this spell, the wizard changes the appearance of all  illusions
within the spell range of the spell recipient. Illusions can be made to  seem
more  real  such that the recipient receives a -4 modifier to any attempt  to
disbelieve.  Alternatively, illusionary qualities  may  be  added  that  make
illusions  more visible. For example, all illusions will be visibly  outlined
in  purple  and will flash hot and cold to the touch. Attempts to  disbelieve
indicated objects can then be made with a +2 modifier.

This  spell  enables  the  wizard to alter the appearance  of  objects.  Each
affected  item within spell range can take on the appearance of another  item
within  the range of the spell. If only a single item is affected it  may  be
given  a completely illusionary appearance, not one copied from another item.
This spell does not affect creatures.
This  spell  is  commonly used to swap appearances such as  to  exchange  the
appearances of two gems or two scrolls. A wizard able to affect 5 items could
exchange  their appearances in a random pattern. The wizard could  choose  to
make  a  scroll  appear as a gem and a gem appear as a  scroll  but  this  be
instantly detectable by touch. The spell affects all senses listed  with  the
spectral  force  spell.  This spell is complete enough  to  copy  non-magical
writings  and  fool  the divination spells detect magic  and  locate  object.
Magical writings are only superficially copied, and any attempt to read  them
causes the illusion to end. Once the spell is cast, the affected items may be
moved beyond the spell range without causing the spell to end.

This  spell  reverses  the effects of armour worn (or lack  thereof)  on  the
subject touched, in the sense that melee attacks that would have normally hit
the  subject will miss, and melee attacks that would have normally missed the
subject  will hit. For example, an AC 5 wizard that has cast armour  reversal
on  himself  is attacked by a 10th-level fighter. The fighter would  normally
need  a 6 or better to hit AC 5; with this spell in effect, the fighter needs
a 5 or less to hit AC 5. Note that this spell is more useful as the amount of
armour the subject has on decreases!
All bonuses to hit that the opponent has work in the opponent's favour, i.e.,
if  the  aforementioned fighter had a Strength of 17 (+1  to-hit)  and  a  +2
weapon, these would be subtracted from the die roll - thus the fighter  would
need an 8 or less to hit AC 5. Likewise, penalties are added to the die roll,
penalising the attacker as usual.
This  spell does not affect missile weapons at all, nor does it affect  spell
saving throws or anything other than melee weapon attacks. If the subject  of
the  spell  is  willing to have the spell cast upon him, there is  no  saving
throw; otherwise the subject saves as usual. The spell can be counteracted by
the  usual  means  (dispel  magic, et al.),  by  another  casting  of  armour
reversal, or by the 7th-level Jamye's improved armour reversal (q.v.).

The material components of this spell are a small magnet and a diamond of  no
less than 100 gp value.

This spell turns the flesh of any creature affected into a golden-brown piece
of  hot yummy toast. Only the victim is affected; anything the victim may  be
wearing  (or non-organic items ingested) will not be turned into  toast.  The
resultant toast is subject to any forces normal toast is subject to (slicing,
buttering,  eating,  whatever). One cubic foot  of  toast  will  satisfy  the
appetites  of  four humans, although they may get tired of toast  way  before
then.

The  material  components of this spell are a small pat of  butter  or  cream
cheese, and 1 foot of steel wire. The steel wire will not be consumed in  the
casting.
Note  that  this spell is not reversible. The effects can only  be  countered
with a wish or limited wish.

This spell differs from the 3rd-level lightning bolt in the following ways:
          the components and casting time are greatly reduced;
          damage done is 1d4 + 2 per wizard level instead of 1d6;
          maximum damage is 15d4+30;
          the bolt is a vivid orange, with green stripes running through it.
It conforms to lightning bolt in all other respects.

This spell is a more powerful version of the 3rd-level haste spell, with  the
1st-level  grease thrown in as well. The people that the spell is  cast  upon
suffer  none of the side effects of the grease (i.e., they won't  drop  their
weapons,  they won't slip, etc.) but those that try to attack  or  grab  them
will.   It   negates  special  attacks  by  creatures  that  inflict   damage
automatically  every  round  after  a  successful  hit  (i.e.,   stirges   or
executioner's hoods) - the creature must roll to hit every round due  to  the
slipperiness of the target. Otherwise, it conforms to the normal haste  spell
(-2  on initiative, double movement rate, double number of attacks per round,
ages recipient 1 year). It is not cumulative with haste or other greased  pig
spells.

The  material components for this spell are a bit of butter and an anise seed
for each recipient.

This  spell summons a pre-prepared headless flying roasted pig. The pig flies
at a rate of 30, and is under the control of the wizard (who must give it his
full  attention).  The pig is magically funny; anyone who looks  at  the  pig
(except the wizard) must save versus spell every round that the pig is in his
field  of  view or fall down laughing until the pig leaves. Laughing  victims
are at a -2 to-hit until the spell expires.
Victims  with  an  Intelligence of 4 or less that are  meat-eaters,  will  be
attracted  to  the pig's delicious aroma and must save at a -6 or  spend  the
rest  of  the  spell's duration trying to catch it. If they are  vegetarians,
they are unaffected. Those with Intelligences of 5-9 save versus the laughter
effect  at  a -4. Those with Intelligences of 10-14 save at a -2. Those  with
Intelligences of 15-19 save normally, and those who are more intelligent than
that are unaffected.
The pig cannot be caught or attacked; those attempting to do so automatically
succumb  to  the laughter. The pig has no other attacks besides  its  magical
nature.  It  can  be  banished  or otherwise  abjured;  dispel  magic  merely
terminates  the wizard's control over it. If dispel magic is successful,  the
pig will leave 50% of the time and stay 50% of the time, the magical laughter
effect  will not be dispelled, but the wizard will become vulnerable  to  the
laughter effects as well.

The  material components are a baked, spiced apple and a hummingbird feather.
Additionally, a pig of no less than 50 pounds must be beheaded,  roasted  and
otherwise  prepared ahead of time; this pig does not have to be carried  with
the  wizard but must not be eaten, as it is consumed by the spell at the  end
of the spell's duration.

This  spell is an improved version of the 5th-level Jamye's armour  reversal.
With  this  spell, bonuses to-hit by the attacker are added to the  die  roll
(thus  working  against the attacker) instead of subtracted. For  example,  a
10th-level  fighter  attacking an AC 5 wizard with improved  armour  reversal
would  need a die roll of 5 or less to hit the wizard; if the fighter  had  a
Strength of 17 (+1 to-hit) and a +2 weapon, he would now need a die roll of 2
or less (5 minus 1, minus 2) to hit the wizard.
This  spell  also  affects missile weapons in the same way it  affects  melee
weapons,  unlike  the 5th-level spell. Also, whereas armour reversal  can  be
dispelled  by a subsequent casting of improved armour reversal  on  the  same
subject, improved armour reversal cannot be so dispelled by the weaker spell.
If  armour  reversal is cast upon the subject of a previous  improved  armour
reversal, the armour reversal is wasted and has no effect.
The spell components for this spell are a small magnet, a piece of black silk
of no less than 20 gp value, and a diamond of no less than 250 gp value.

This  spell takes effect after the victim has had a minimum of two  hours  of
sleep.  The victim loses all memory of events that occurred between the  time
the spell was cast and when he awoke.
The  DM  is  encouraged to make up some appropriate material components.  The
victim  will  remember the existence of any material components used  in  the
spell.
The  effects of the spell last 1d6 rounds per level of the wizard. The wizard
should not be told the duration of the spell.

When  cast,  this spell creates a pile of coloured snowballs at the  wizard's
feet. The number of snowballs is equal to the duration of the spell in rounds
-  2  at third level, 3 at sixth level, 4 at ninth level, etc. The wizard can
throw  one  snowball per round as if he were proficient in snowball throwing.
Other  characters  can  also throw snowballs, but they  will  suffer  a  non-
proficiency  penalty  for  it  (unless  they  have  taken  a  proficiency  in
snowballs). The snowball has a range of 30 yards, plus 10 yards per  Strength
point of the thrower over 12.
The  snowballs do no physical damage when they hit; however, they have powers
that  vary  with the colour of the snowball according to the chart below.  In
order  for  the snowball's magic to work, the target must be hit with  it  (a
successful  to-hit  roll  required). The snowball's power  only  affects  the
creature  hit, even if the spell it duplicates has a greater area of  effect.
The  snowballs  are always picked up and thrown in the order given,  starting
with red and ending (assuming the wizard is high enough level) with violet.

The material component for the spell is a small rainbow-coloured marble.
* If the yellow snowball hits on an unmodified die roll of 20, the victim has
been  hit  in the face and has eaten some of the snow. It must then  make  an
additional  saving  throw  versus poison at a -4  or  be  violently  ill  (no
attacks,  Armour  Class  worsens by 4) for a number of  hours  equal  to  the
wizard's level.

This spell affects the saving throws versus spells of the subject in much the
same  way  that  the 5th-level Jamye's armour reversal (q.v.) affects  attack
rolls,  i.e.  saving throw results that would normally indicate success  will
fail, and results that would normally fail will succeed. For example, a 19th-
level  wizard normally needs a 6 or greater to save versus spell.  If  he  is
affected by a spell reversal, he will need a 5 or less (i.e. a failure  under
normal  circumstances)  to  save  versus spell.  Protection  devices,  Wisdom
bonuses,  etc. still work to the benefit of the subject, i.e.  if  the  above
wizard  had a ring of protection, +3 and a Wisdom of 16 (+2 magical defense),
he would need an 8 or less to save versus most spells (5 normally, +3 for the
Ring)  and a 10 or less to save versus spells that would give him his  Wisdom
bonus.  Likewise, penalties to saving throws still work to the  detriment  of
the  subject. If the subject is willing, there is no saving throw; otherwise,
a  normal saving throw versus spell (obviously, this is made before the spell
takes effect) will negate it.
There  are certain special cases that apply to this spell. It is not affected
by spell turning. The only thing that can dispel it is another spell reversal
cast  at  the subject, who must make a saving throw while under the influence
of  the  original  spell reversal. If the subject is under the  influence  of
another  spell  that grants invulnerability to certain spells (shield  versus
magic missile, for instance, or any type of globe of invulnerability, but not
anti-magic  shell), the subject takes full, maximum damage  from  that  spell
with  no  saving  throw.  For instance, a wizard has both  shield  and  spell
reversal cast upon him. If he is targeted for magic missiles during the  time
both  spells  are functioning, he will take 5 points of damage - the  maximum
possible - from each missile that hits him.

The  material  components for this spell are a piece of amber worth  no  less
than300 gp, and a doughnut made less than 24 hours previously.

This spell allows the recipient to manipulate any mechanical device that  was
attached  to him at the time of the spell's casting. In short, it allows  the
usage of mechanical limbs that have been attached to somebody by that person.
For  example:  a  victim  of  an accident has  lost  his  arm.  A  mechanical
replacement can be made, but must have a value of 1000 gp or more.  The  limb
is  attached, and then the spell is cast. From then on, as long as the  spell
is  in  effect,  the recipient of the spell can control all  the  joints  and
levers  on  that  limb.  A  recipient may  have  as  many  functions  as  his
Intelligence, because the wearer must concentrate a little bit more  than  an
ordinarily  limb.  A  single  limb is counted as  a  function,  but  creative
designers  can add crossbows, blades, and many other devices that each  count
as  a  function.  This spell can allow the manipulation  of  hinges,  levers,
pulleys,  and  wheels. If the limb is separated from the body, the  recipient
can  still  control its functions to a range of touch. This  spell  does  not
bestow  the benefits of a sense of touch. The operating strength is equal  to
1«  times the caster's level, rounded up, but only grants 10% per point  past
18  Strength.  Thus,  an arm enchanted by a 14th-level wizard  would  have  a
Strength  of 18/20 for attacks made with that arm only. Because the  rest  of
the  person doesn't have 18/20 Strength, he is still considered as having his
normal strength.
Artificial  Limbs  are much sturdier than their natural counterparts.  Except
under  very  extreme stress, they are not likely to take damage.  This  spell
must  be cast once for each limb to be enchanted. This spell can also be used
to  turn  wheels. A wheel of 3-foot diameter can be turned at four  time  the
caster's level rounds per minute.

This  spell is used to attach artificial limbs to their recipients. The spell
is permanent, as it is magically fused to the body. It can only be removed if
specifically dispelled or the recipient wills his limb to fall off. The spell
must be recast to reattach the limb. The material component of this spell  is
a small ball of pitch or honey.

The affected people will become jealous of each other to the extent that they
will  ignore  the  wizard or any other source of danger present  and  quarrel
amongst  themselves. There is a chance equal to the wizard's Intelligence  of
such  an  argument leading to blows and, if it does, there is  an  additional
chance equal to the wizard's Intelligence of the fight being to the death. If
the fight is not to the death, then the combatants will come out of the spell
when hit.

This  devotion  is a variation applied to the levitation  devotion
specially created to allow fast moving during levitation.  He  can
move  up  or  down  very fast changing the  speed  as  he  wishes,
however, he cannot change the direction or the trajectory  of  the
movement.
      Levitation  allows  the user to float.  It  is  the  use  of
telekinesis on oneself.  A character can lift himself at the  rate
of 3 foot per second, or 180 feet per round (10 m/s or 36 km/h).
      The  character can descend as quickly as he wants by  simply
letting  himself fall, then slowing down as he nears  the  ground.
Levitation  is  not  flying;  it doesn't  provide  any  horizontal
movement.  Additionally,  in  this  variation  of  levitation  the
direction  cannot  be  changed, the  psionicist  must  define  his
trajectory before starting the power.
      A  psionicist can always levitate his own weight. Additional
weight,  however, such as equipment or passengers, is a hindrance.
Every  25  pounds  of added weight reduces the  character's  power
score by one point.
      Reference:  Luke  against Dark Vader in The  Empire  Strikes
Back.

Power Score:  The rate of levitation is doubled.

20:  The psionicist doubles his weight for one round. If he falls,
he suffers an extra 1d6 points of damage.

This   is   the  "use  the  force  Luke"  power.  The   psionicist
concentrates all his mind capacities in the task he intend  to  do
in  the next round, granting a +5 (or +25%) bonus in this task  in
the  succeeding round. This power can be used only  one  time  per
task and the duration is fixed in one round.
     The bonus can be used in any action the psionicist wants. The
only requisite is: he must know what he will do in the next round.
     Reference: "Use the force Luke" in Star Wars (Movie)

Power Score:  The bonus is +6 at half cost.

20:  The psionicist forget how to do the task for 1d4 rounds.

This devotion is a specialization of the telekinesiscience created
to move heavy objects.
     With this devotion the psychokinesis specialist (a psionicist
with  psychokinesis  as  his primary discipline)  can  move  heavy
objects without so, high PSP cost and power score penalties.
      -  The  initial cost equals the 1/10 of object's  weight  in
pounds. The minimum initial cost is 10 PSP. For very heavy (1 ton.
or  more) objects the cost is 10 times the object weight in  tons,
but the power score penalties are much higher (see table below).
      -  The  maintenance cost is half the initial  cost,  rounded
down.  The  psionicist must make a power check each round  or  the
object will crash down.
     - The character's power score is Wis -2 decreased as shown on
tables below.

The following restrictions are applied in this variation of TK.
      A  psionicist using TK with this devotion can move an object
up  to 10 feet per round. The object cannot serve as weapon. Leave
a  heavy object to fall in a creature is very difficult, since the
object  moves very slowly and the creature should see it and  move
away.
      The  maintenance  of this power is very  difficult  and  the
psionicist  must make a power check in each round  or  the  object
will fall.
      This  power requires great concentration and the  psionicist
cannot perform any other action while maintaining this power.  The
psionicist must be unmovable, cannot talk and can look only to the
object being moved.
      This  power can only be used to move objects in very  simple
and pre-defined (decided before the start) trajectories.
     Reference: Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back.

Power  Score:  The psionicist can maintain this power without  any
other power check.

20:   The  psionicist will not be able to move this item until  he
gains a level.

This spell causes a jet of superheated steam to shoot from the wizard's hand,
striking  one victim up to 5 feet away per level of the wizard. If  a  saving

damage.  Since  the jet is quite narrow, a successful saving throw  indicates

The recipients of this spell are made more aware of the magic around them and
are also more able to affect it. They therefore have a magic resistance of 5%
per  level of the wizard. A dispel magic is only half as likely as normal  to
dispel  this  spell. The material component of this spell is a gem  worth  at
least 200 gp.

This  combines  wizard  sight, read magic and detect magic.  The  wizard  can
detect  auras of spell casters and enchanted objects normally visible to  the
wizard,  and can detect through one foot of stone, inch of metal and yard  of
wood.  Any  visible  magical writing may be deciphered. The  wizard  can  see
whether anyone is casting any spells and gain information on the spell  being
cast  as well. For example, he could determine the potential and power  of  a
wizard's  aura,  whether  it is a cleric or mage  (or  specialist  priest  or
wizard), school and sphere, etc. The wizard's eyes become blue and show up as
magical.

This  power  allows  the psionicist to over  stimulate  the  nerve
centers  of  the body and cause a large electrical buildup,  which
can  be  discharged  by touch or through any conductive  material.
This  discharged causes 1D10 hit points of damage.   This  buildup
remains in the psionicists body until he discharges it.

Power Score:  The damage is doubled.

20:   The  electrical charge discharges in the  psionicist  brain,
stunning him for 1D6 rounds and causing 1D10 hit points of damage.

An  improved  form of Tenser's floating disc, the skimmer is  designed  as  a
flying  vehicle for the wizard. The wizard reclines in a moulded seat at  the
centre  of the 3-foot radius disc. The "wings" each have room for one person,
or  a  comparable  volume of cargo. It can lift 50 pounds per  level  of  the
wizard.  The  skimmer  can  move at speeds up to  25  miles  per  hour  (this
approximates MV 70), and has manoeuvrability class A at speeds less  than  MV
21.  The  wizard  is protected from acceleration, passengers  are  not.  When
stopped,  the  skimmer can rotate on a dime. The wizard has full  cover  from
below.  The skimmer can take 5 HP per level of the wizard. Ramming,  it  does
(MV/3)d6  damage to both itself and the target. Only the wizard  can  control
the  skimmer; it hovers motionless if he is unconscious or dies. The  skimmer
is  a  stable casting platform. The material component of the spell is a drop
of mercury.

The victims of this spell must be within 30 feet of each other, with a centre
determined  by the caster. This spell affects 2d6 HD of creatures,  affecting
lower  level creatures first, with partial effects ignored. Creatures of  6+3
HD  or  more  are unaffected. The result of the spell is to make its  victims
feel sleepy, giving them a +2 penalty to their Armour Class, and a -2 penalty
on  their to-hit rolls, with all Dexterity bonuses for combat negated.  If  a
creature that has been subject to the drowse has more than 4+3 HD, it can  be
subject  to sleep (q.v.), although it is allowed a saving throw at  -4).  The
material component of this spell is a pinch of fine sand.

This  spell  will  not affect lycanthropes, undead, enchanted  creatures,  or
creatures  from other planes. It will, however, affect elves. Creatures  with
Hit  Dice  or levels less than half of the caster's levels are not allowed  a
saving throw; otherwise a saving throw negates the spell's effects. When  the
person  touched fails a saving throw, he immediately falls into a deep sleep,
very  similar to the feign death spell (especially with respect  to  poisons,
paralysis,  etc.). The sleep is permanent until a limited wish or wish  spell
is  used to awaken him, or until the prescribed conditions set by the  caster
are  met.  These  conditions  must be reasonable  (that  is,  possible).  The
material components are a handful of chamomile and a small amount of wine, in
which is placed a ruby of no less than 500 gp value.

This  spell makes it impossible for the person affected to fall asleep during
the  duration. A saving throw is allowed at -5, although for every two levels
of  the victim this penalty is decreased by 1 (two Hit Dice creatures save at
-4,  four  Hit Dice creatures save at -3, etc.). Even elves are  affected  by
this  spell. The only way to stop the effects is by the use of a remove curse
cast  by  someone  of  equal or higher level than the  wizard  who  cast  the
original  spell, or some more powerful spell (such as limited wish or  wish).
The material component is a handful of rose thorns.
The  reverse  of the spell, Kaldane's somnolence, causes the victim  to  fall
asleep  for the set amount of time. The saving throw for this spell, however,
is at +1 for every two levels of the victim. The victim need not be fed while
the  spell  is  in effect, as his metabolism is considerably lowered.  Remove
curse  will  dispel  the  effects. The material component  is  a  handful  of
belladonna leaves.

The  victims  of  this spell will instantly feel twice  the  load  that  they
thought   they   were  carrying,  slowing  their  movement   and   increasing
encumbrance.  If a character is suddenly burdened with one and a  half  their
maximum encumbrance, there is a 50% chance that damage will be taken.  Damage
incurred  is 1d6 per 50 pounds above the maximum. If a character is  suddenly
burdened with twice maximum encumbrance, damage will automatically be  taken,
with  a  30% chance of causing a permanent limp or back injury. The  material
component is a piece of lead.

This spell is similar to Kaldane's instant fatigue in that the victims of the
spell's  effects  must  be  within 30 feet  of  each  other,  with  a  centre
determined by the caster, and it affects 1d3+1 creatures per four  levels  of
the  caster.  Victims are allowed a Constitution check at  -4  (+1  per  four
levels). Creature of size L or larger suffer fatigue if the check is  failed;
smaller creatures suffer the effects of exhaustion. They lose 4 points of all
ability scores, including any bonuses gained by higher scores, plus -4 on all
attack rolls (including damage), and saving throws. Exhausted characters will
not be able to perform any physical activity besides defending themselves for
more  than 1d4 rounds or risk losing consciousness. If a character rests  for
one hour, and then makes a Constitution check (using the modified score),  he
will  become fatigued; otherwise, the character remains exhausted for another
hour. Exhaustion will last no longer than 6 hours. The material component  of
this spell is a drop of dwarf blood mixed with tree sap.

Similar  to Kaldane's other spells, the victims of this spell must be  within
30 feet of each other. For every four levels of the caster, 1d3 creatures can
be affected. Each victim is allowed a Constitution check with a -4 penalty to
try  to  negate the effects. This roll is further modified by a +1 bonus  for
every  four  levels  of  the  victim (thus, a 9th-level  fighter  with  a  16
Constitution  would  have to roll a 14 or lower to  negate  the  spell).  The
result  of  the  spell  is  that  the victim suffers  immediate  fatigue,  as
described  in the Wilderness Survival Guide (q.v.). This means a  loss  of  2
points  in every ability score, along wiany bonuses gained by a higher  score
(to-hit  and damage adjustments for Strength, bonus spells for Wisdom,  bonus
hit points for Constitution, etc.); plus a further -2 on all attack rolls (to-
hit  and  damage). Note that these effects are temporary. After one  hour  of
rest  the  victim is allowed another Constitution check (with  no  modifiers,
using  his  lowered score). If the check is successful, then the fatigue  has
worn  off,  and  all ability scores are again back to normal; otherwise,  the
fatigue  lasts for another hour, at which point another check is made.  If  a
fatigued  character  continues  to do strenuous  activity,  he  must  make  a
Constitution  check once every turn or become exhausted. The instant  fatigue
won't  last longer than three hours. The material component of this spell  is
sweat from some human or humanoid being (excluding that of the caster).

This spell is similar to Kaldane's drowse (q.v.) in that the victims must  be
within  30  feet of each other, with a centre determined by the  caster.  The
lullaby  affects  2d8 Hit Dice of creatures, affecting lower level  creatures
first,  with  partial  effects ignored. Creatures  of  8+3  HD  or  more  are
unaffected.  This spell will not affect elves. The victims of the  spell  are
subject  to all the effects of a slow spell (+4 penalty to Armour  Class,  -4
penalty  to-hit, all Dexterity bonuses for combat negated, and half  movement
and  weapon attacks). Victims will feel very tired, desiring to go to  sleep,
requiring a saving throw every other round (on the second round the spell  is

This spell allows any type of rest to be more beneficial. Those affected  can
rest  or  sleep  for an amount of time, and when the time is  over,  for  all
purposes, it will seem as though they have rested for three times the  amount
that  they  really did. For example, someone under the influence of Kaldane's
peaceful rest can sleep for 2 hours, and when he awakes, it will seem as if 6
hours  of  rest  have passed. Hit points cannot be gained faster,  but  spell
casters  can  benefit by sleeping shorter amounts of time  than  it  normally
takes  before new spells can be memorised. Likewise, the effects  of  fatigue
and  exhaustion will wear off faster. The material components of  this  spell
are a feather from a duck and a live cricket.
The  reverse  of this spell, Kaldane's turbulent rest, makes it so  that  any
amount  of  rest will not be beneficial (that is, spells cannot be  memorised
after  such  a turbulent night's sleep). Victims are allowed a saving  throw,
and  the spell only affects the next night's sleep (provided the victims fall
asleep  within 6 hours) or the next period of rest (provided it occurs within
the next 6 hours). The material component for the reverse is a pea.

This  spell  allows  the  wizard to cast various  spells  requiring  physical
contact  at  range. The wizard must have a clear view of the creature  to  be
"touched", and there can be no obstructions between target and wizard.
To  use  this spell, the wizard first casts long arm, then whatever spell  he
wants  to  do  at range, in the following round. If the wizard  is  disturbed
following the casting of long arm, the spell is ruined. Disturbance could  be
anything from heavy jostling, to actually taking damage. If the target  moves
out  of  sight before the wizard can get off the second spell, the  spell  is
ruined. The target gets regular saving throws for the second spell.

The  material component of this spell is a jade tipped wand, which disappears
after casting.

With  this  spell, the wizard is able to "store" one spell  for  every  three
levels  he possesses (i.e. two at fourth, three at seventh, etc.). The wizard
"paints"  the  spells  around himself as runes, in effect,  casting  them,  a
process  taking  one  turn per spell. The spells are now  "hung"  around  the
wizard, and can be released by command, an action taking only one tenth of  a
round.
If  the  wizard concentrates, glowing runes representing the remaining spells
in  the  load  will appear about the wizard, visible only to the wizard.  The
wizard  must  specify in the casting of the load what the verbal  or  somatic
commands  are to be for the release of each spell. The wizard also determines
the  appearance  of each representative rune. Detect magic  will  reveal  the
presence of the spell load, and true seeing will allow the wizard to see  the
rune representations of the spells in the load.
A  spell load gets two saving throws versus any one dispel magic cast at  it.
First,  it  gets the wizard's saving throw versus death magic,  and  if  that
fails,  it has a 100% chance of being dispelled, minus 5% for each level  the
spell  load casting wizard has greater than that of the dispel magic  casting
wizard.
Releasing  the  spells  by  command takes only  one  tenth  of  a  round  for
initiative purposes, and the wizard can release two spells per round, but  if
two  spells are released, there is a 50-(wizard's level) percent chance  that
the  spell  load will be broken and they will all go off. No  more  than  six
spells can be set into a spell load.
Material components are a diamond tipped stylus, worth at least 1000 gp,  and
an  amount  of  molten gold, with which the runes are painted.  The  gold  is
consumed  in  the casting of the spell, but the stylus is still  usable.  The
runes are visible to all during the casting of the spell load, and they flare
briefly when the spell they represent is cast.

With  this  spell, the caster enchants his own quarterstaff  into  a  special
"throwing  staff".  He can then swing it over his head and  hurl  it  at  his
opponents  at great speed. The staff is considered magical (+1) to  determine
what  can  be hit. The quarterstaff strikes with a THAC0 equal to that  of  a
fighter of equal level (plus any Strength bonuses and magical bonuses). So, a
+1 staff enchanted by a 5th-level wizard with normal Strength would strike at
THAC0 15, damage done is 2d6 + 1d6 per 2 levels over 3rd (3d6 at 5th; 4d6  at
7th; and a maximum of 5d6 at 9th).
When  the staff hits something, or when it would leave the spell's range,  it
returns  in  the  direction of the caster. The wizard  then  has  to  make  a
Dexterity check with a bonus of 2, to avoid dropping the staff and  losing  a
full  round recovering it. This staff-hurling is strenuous business, and  the
wizard  can only do it for (Constitution DIV 3) rounds. After that, he cannot
engage  in any too strenuous activity (no spellcasting, nor combat;  movement
is  halved)  for  1d4  rounds. Also, at the end of the  duration,  the  staff
disappears, since it is the material component of the spell.
This spell was developed by the Perendor Kalim, a well-known Transmuter,  who
lives  in the Waterdeep area (Forgotten Realms). He is still adventuring  and
has  been  known to work on a new, defensive, spell, something that  involved
air shields.

This  spell  creates  a ball of extreme cold and sharp  ice  particles  which
expands  outward  from its detonation point. All creatures  in  the  area  of
effect  will take 1d6 points of damage per level of the wizard from the  cold
(save  versus spell for half damage). All objects in the area of effect  will
be  frozen, and a layer of frost will cover the surface of everything in  the
area  of  effect. If a creature fails its saving throw then all of his  items
must make a saving throw versus frost or be destroyed by the extreme cold.
Because  of  the  sharp  particles  of ice created  in  the  detonation,  the
explosion  will  still cause damage to those who are immune  to  cold.  If  a
creature is immune to cold, then the damage will be 1d2 points of damage  per
level of the wizard with a saving throw for half as normal.
The  spell  does structural damage to wooden structures as does the  fireball
spell. Otherwise, this spell is the same in all respects as fireball.

The  material components for this spell is a handful of glass crystals or any
kind of crystals which is thrown in the direction that the wizard wishes  the
Iceball to go.

With  each  casting of this spell, the priest raises his effective  level  by
one,  to  a  maximum of two additional levels of effectiveness. The  increase
applies  to  all the priest's actions: spell effects, turning undead,  saving
throws, hit probability, etc. Hit points, number of spells known and level of
spells known are not affected by this spell. The material component for  this
spell is the priest's holy symbol.

The  shimmering field of force that is created by this spell will act  as  an
armour  for  the spellcaster. It appears as a transparent shirt worn  by  the
caster  and  seems  to be radiating some light. It gives  that  recipient  an
Armour  Class  of  0  against all physical attacks, from all  directions.  In
addition,  it gives a bonus of +2 to saving throws against spells and  breath
weapons  during  the duration of the spell. The material  component  of  this

      This spell grants the caster a +1 bonus to subsequent rolls on the Wild
Magic  Level Variation table. This bonus remains in effect for one round  for
every two experience levels of the caster.

      Wild surges are determined using the adjusted roll, and the +1 bonus is
applied to the percentile roll for the surge as well.

The  material component of this spell is a rabbit's foot, a four leaf clover,
or  another  good luck charm. The charm cannot be purchased; the caster  must
create the charm on his own: by killing the rabbit and procuring the foot, by
finding  a  clover on a patch, etc. Any charm may be ruled valid by  the  DM,
though  it  must be similarly difficult to come by. While this charm  is  not
consumed  by  the spell, the caster should take care that a perishable  charm
like a rabbit's foot or a four leaf clover is suitably preserved.

This  spell affects a number of creatures within the area of effect equal  to
half  the  casters  level, rounded up. The creatures  affected  are  randomly
determined  from all creatures in the area of effect, excluding  the  caster.
Note  that  the spell does not discriminate between the caster's friends  and
foes.
The  spell  causes the targets' hit points to flash in a bright  neon  colour
above  the  targets' head. This number will appear in the native language  of
the  caster; anyone who can read this language can read the hit point  number
as well.
Creatures who are held, petrified, asleep, unconscious, or otherwise inactive
are  not  included in the random determination. Creatures who are  invisible,
hiding  in  shadows,  or otherwise unknown to the caster,  are  likewise  not
included.  A creature under the effects of an illusion which the  caster  has
not  disbelieved will have the illusory hit points flash, rather  than  their
actual hit point values.
The  arestrictions only apply to the initial random determination of targets.
If   a  creature  affected  by  the  spell  becomes  unconscious,  petrified,
invisible, etc., the hit points continue to flash over their head. If one  of
the  targets was under the effects of an illusion and the caster subsequently
disbelieves it (or its duration expires), the neon hit points will update  to
show the new perceived value.
Note  that while the concept of hit points is one of game mechanics,  and  in
actuality  has  no  meaning  the  player characters  observing  this  spell's
effects,  the number shown can be interpreted by the characters as a relative
measure of strength and health of the creatures affected.

The material component of this spell is a small piece of coloured glass.

This  spell  is  identical to the 1st-level Nahal's reckless dweomer,  except
that it has no verbal or somatic components. A wild mage creates a surge with
this  spell  from  the  sheer force of his will. Because  no  time  is  spent
gesticulating  and  chanting, as with the 1st-level spell,  this  version  is
quicker  to  cast,  as well. This spell is very useful as a  last  resort  in
situations where the caster is bound and gagged, or otherwise unable to  take
any useful action.
DMs  might  want  to  disallow this spell, since it upsets  game  balance  by
crossing  the fine line between psionics, based upon one's inner  force,  and
wizardry, which draws upon external forces.

This  powerful spell gives a wild wizard access to many spells of the  school
of  divination. Like the spell wish, however, this flexibility does not  come
without  a  price.  Every casting of this spell has  a  high  probability  of
causing a wild surge.
When  the spell is cast, the caster should roll 1d4. If this roll is a 1,  2,
or 3, then that is the level of the divination spell this spell produces. The
caster  may then name any divination spell of the level rolled with which  he
is  familiar. If the named spell is in the wizard's spell books,  success  is
guaranteed. If the caster has seen the spell cast in the past, but  does  not
know  it himself, the DM should roll for the caster's spellcraft proficiency,
at a penalty depending on how recently and how many times the caster has seen
the  spell.  A  missed spellcraft roll will cause a wild surge on  the  spell
attempted.
If  the  wizard rolled a 4, a wild surge is caused. The wizard may  name  any
divination spell, even one of a higher level than he can cast, or one that he
has only a vague, passing familiarity with, for this surge.
If  a  divination  spell  is successfully cast via  this  spell,  the  range,
duration,  area  of effect, and possibility of saving throw should  be  taken
from  the  divination cast. The material component of this spell is a  finely
carved  set of rune stones, worth at least 1000 gp, which is not consumed  by
the  spell.  The wizard must have a surface available on which  to  cast  the
runes  and  be  able  to  study them for a round for the  spell  to  be  cast
successfully.

      This  spell  is a minor illusion affecting small details of appearance,
for a better overall image. In game effects, it increases the caster's beauty
and,  to  a small extent, her charm as well. Smiles seem to be lit  up,  eyes
twinkle  just a little more, the face seems to have a little more definition,
etc.  The  bonus  is  normally +2 to Charisma, or +1 to Charisma  and  +1  to
Comeliness  if  that  attribute  is used. If  the  caster  has  a  non-weapon
proficiency  in a visual art (sculpture, painting, etc.), then  it  is  a  +3
Charisma in the former case, or +1 Charisma, +2 Comeliness in the latter.

      This spell causes a set of long claws to grow from the fingers of  both
hands  of  the casting wizard. These claws do 1d4 damage. This is a  flexible
spell, in that many different wizards may tweak the initial pattern to get  a
"look"  to their own claws, such as cat-claws, bear-claws, gee-that's-a-neat-
claws,  etc.  The basic length and effectiveness of the claws is  changeable,
however,  so bear claws will seem small on a bear, and cat claws large  on  a
cat.  Katrine always tweaked them to look like the talons of a bird of  prey,
such as the owl.
To cast this spell, the caster snarls and pulls both hands into a fist before
releasing the fist as if popping claws.

      These  claws require a to-hit roll to be made to do damage,  so  it  is
recommended  that  DMs allow wizards to take a weapon proficiency  in  claws.
This  is easily justified as they take little training. In general, either  a
wizard  will  pick up the skill after finding the spell, or will  start  with
both.

This  spell  is  a delayed reaction spell which, under preset  conditions  of
relatively  simple nature (two dwarves and an elf enter room),  generates  an
illusory  skull head which delivers a message of up to 125 words.  The  spell
can last up to a month before the message is lost. The spell requires a pinch
of  bone  dust  from  a skull (the type of skull determines  what  skull  the
illusion looks like), which is consumed after the spell. The wizard casts the
spell  by first uttering several arcane phrases, and then saying the  message
while  moving her left hand open and shut as the skulls jaw will do when  the
message  is  given. If the caster is hit while delivering  the  message,  the
spell is lost.
This  spell is another version of magic mouth with a longer message possible,
but  a more limiting time span. Katrine researched it because she didn't have
access to the original magic mouth spell.

     This causes a small cylindrical object (splinter, dart, needle, etc.) to
become  a  flaming dart which will strike the desired target. If  the  target
fails  the  saving throw, the dart does 1d4 damage per level. This  spell  is
overall weaker than magic missile, but more versatile in that the caster need
not see the target in order to hit it. As long as the target is within range,
and  the  caster has some way of distinguishing it (whatever's  causing  that
smell around the corner, or the orc guard behind the cracked door), the  dart
will strike the target. This is particularly effective in sheer darkness.  It
is cast by muttering arcane words while tossing the cylindrical object in the
initial direction the dart will take.

This is one of Katrine's nastier spells. It creates an opaque blue sphere  of
force  capable of moving at the same rate as the caster (polymorphing into  a
faster  form will not improve the sphere's speed, however). It has  a  flight
class  of  D,  but  can slow down and stop in one round (speeding  up  is  as
normal).  The  sphere can take commands of no more than two  or  three  words
(such  as  "attack her" or "protect me"), and can act on its own towards  its
original purpose (which is to protect the caster unless told otherwise).  The
sphere has 20 HP, and will last indefinitely until the caster sends it out of
its  range or until it takes in excess of 20 points of damage. The sphere has
an  Armour Class equal to its caster's minus 2 (if the caster has AC  8,  the
Sphere has AC 6) and its THAC0 (or to-hit table) is the same as its caster's.
The  sphere can, once each round, deliver a kinetic blast at its target which
does 1d4 damage per level of its caster, or it can slam into someone for  1d6
damage.  Note  that  it can do either or both of these actions  in  the  same
round,  but cannot use one of them twice. The blast can do either stun damage
or  killing damage (stun damage: only a quarter of the damage done  is  real,
the remainder simply counts towards knocking the target out).
Any  attacks that are directed at the caster can be intercepted by the sphere
if  it  is  not slamming into an opponent, and as long as it is within  three
feet of the caster at the time.

      This spell turns the caster into a pseudo-falcon. This form is as close
to  being  a  real  falcon as Katrine could manage at the time,  but  is  not
entirely  real.  This spell can be overlapped with Katrine kitty  kat,  which
lasts  for  24  hours, so that when this spell weaoff, rather  than  being  a
falcon, the caster will be a house cat. In order to affect herself with  this
spell,  the caster must have a maximum of 10 Strength, and cannot weigh  more
than 150 pounds.

      The  falcon form has a movement rate of 3 on ground, and 24 in  flight.
Compared  to  the caster, its Strength is -4 (with a minimum of 2),  and  its
Dexterity is at +1. It has 1d4 talons, keen sight, and -3 HP per Hit  Die  of
the caster, with a minimum of « HP per level.

      While  a  falcon, the caster can still speak, but the voice is strained
and wild, like a falcon. Any verbal components other than "shriek" have a 50%
chance (-2% per level of the wizard) of failing. Most somatic components  are
impossible  while a falcon (adjudicated by the DM). Material  components,  as
long as the material is easily accessible, are simple enough.

This  spell  creates a pocket dimension inside a hollowed out egg  which  can
hold  up to 250 pounds or 20 cubic feet. For conversion purposes, 12«  pounds
equals  one  cubic  feet, so a wizard could put something that  took  up  125
pounds  and  took  up 10 cubic feet in thee (a small human being  or  typical
elf). The caster must place the items desired into the egg at the time of the
casting,  and may not take them out until everything is taken out.  When  the
spell  duration runs out, or the egg is shattered (a hard tap  will  do  it),
everything  that was stored in the egg appears again (placing the  egg  in  a
small  container and then leaving it for several days somewhere can be  fun).
The wizard casts the spell by moving the hollowed out egg over her head in  a
complex pattern while chanting slowly.

      This  spell transforms the caster into a house cat for a day, or  until
dispelled.  The cat's fur will be the colour of the caster's hair,  and  eyes
will match eyes. As the cat is considerably weaker than the caster nine times
out  of ten (the tenth being what is known as dead), it is not suggested that
this  be  used as a combat spell. The caster must have a maximum Strength  of
10,  and cannot weigh more than 150 pounds for the spell to be able to affect
her.

      While  a  cat, the caster has a movement rate of 18, 1d2 claws,  night-
vision,  keen hearing, and keen smell. Her Strength is lowered by  -4  (to  a
minimum  of Strength 1) and Dexterity is increased by +2. Her hit points  are
decreased by -2 per Hit Die, to a minimum of 1 HP per level.

     While transformed, the caster is still able to speak, but not very well,
and  any  spells  requiring a verbal component will  have  a  50%  chance  of
failure,  -2% per level of the wizard. Somatic components will  be  close  to
impossible for anything other than cantrips. Material components, as long  as
they require little manipulation, are simple enough.

      This  cantrip  causes  a  high-pitched, girlish  giggle  to  come  into
existence somewhere within 20 yards of the caster. The caster controls  where
it  will  sound. It only lasts for second or two, and requires the caster  to

      This  spell stimulates the pleasure centres of any one person that  the
caster  is  in  contact  with. It is a combination of  an  illusion  of  mild
pleasure, and an enhancement of pre-existing pleasure. It lasts for one hour,
but  is  only  active while she is in contact with the person.  The  illusory
pleasure  is  not very intense, simply a thrill along the appropriate  sense,
but  the  enhancement  depends on the strength of the initial  pleasure.  For
example,  the taste of chocolate, smell of old books in a library,  brush  of
skin  on  skin, sound of a symphony, or even looking at a sunset. In  casting
it, the wizard forms a simple pattern with her fingers while muttering arcane
words. The spell's target must be willing for the spell to function.

     This spell arranges the target's hair, cleans the face and skin, applies
some minimal amounts of make-up, sprays the target with any desired perfumes,
fixes  the target's clothing or minor bits of apparel, etc. The spell  cannot
dress  the  target.  The caster must have all the objects needed  to  perform
these operations on hand (make-up, perfumes, bits of apparel, etc.) and  must
mime  the  initial  actions desired while muttering  the  appropriate  arcane
words.  It doesn't have to be a great mime, however. Upon casting the  spell,
the  desired objects begin flying around the target and fixing her  up.  This
spell  applies  equally well to males as to females, and can be  reversed  to
muss the target up (Katrine's quick muss). For either use, the target must be
willing.

      This  spell  produces a small, one person tent composed of opaque  blue
kinetic  energy. The tent is capable of sustaining up to 80 pounds of  force,
or  extremely strong winds (81 pounds of person or object falling on the tent
will  collapse  it, or someone weighing at least 150 pounds kicking  it  will
collapse it). The spell fades into a fine mist when the first rays of the sun
hit  it. The caster must grasp a pinch of the earth the Tent will be on while
muttering several arcane phrases.

      This is a spell similar to charm, but weaker, and more diffuse. It tugs
at  the  heartstrings of all who are close enough to speak with her normally,
and  makes  her look more helpless. Obviously, this is not the  spell  for  a
Strength  14  male  magic-user with an imposing look  and  great  staff.  The
casting  is simply a few arcane words and a pulling motion from the  caster's
heart, but the effects won't build up for a full round. The spell effectively
adds  +25%  to  the  caster's reaction modifier (under Charisma),  and  makes
others  more willing to believe a single story she tells. Disbelieving simply
means  that they have shaken off the idea that she is more helpless than  she
is,  and  will not be more or less likely to react favourably. Only creatures
within a 10-yard radius are affected.

     This spell allows the bard to pick locks. The bard's pick pockets chance
becomes  his  open locks chance, and the bard is treated as a thief  in  this
respect for the entire duration of the spell.

      This  spell  is different from both the 2nd-level knock spell  and  the
unlock  cantrip in that it can possibly affect much more than one  lock,  and
that  its  effects  are far less certain. It is especially  useful  on  fact-
finding  missions where the bard is worried about coming across  many  locked
doors along the way.

The material components for this spell are a set of thieves' picks and tools,
which are not consumed in the casting.

This  spell slowly incinerates a victim from the feet up turning him  into  a
pile  of  ash  (imagine a cigarette). Once successfully  started,  the  spell
cannot  be  stopped  short  of the use of a wish. A bright  red-orange  ember
slowly  works its way up from the feet to the head converting all flesh  into
ash. It is a very slow and excruciatingly painful process. The victim is kept
alive  until the ember reaches the level of the brain (to extend the  torture
to  its maximum). Any fire-resistance or successful saving throw versus death
magic will prevent the conversion to ash, but the ember still progresses  its
way up as normal, inflicting 2d12 damage, and renders the victim immobile for
1  turn  due  to the intense pain. To date, there has been found  no  reverse
spell to counter the effects of a conversion to ash. Spell components include
one  black  smoky quartz, worth 75 gp or more (used up in the  spell)  and  a
strand of webbing from a gargantuan spider soaked in its venom (not used up).
This spell was created by a drow vampire (W19/F9) named Kelennor. Ironically,
legend  claims  the first victim of this spell was the vampire  that  changed
Kelennor into his undead state.

This  spell makes a character completely forget a single weapon or  nonweapon
proficiency.  The  character thus affected forgets any  knowledge  about  and
loses  any  abilities granted by that particular proficiency, and  may  elect
either  to  relearn  that proficiency or to learn a new  one.  This  learning
process,  however,  takes  the remainder of that character's  present  level.
Basically, he will gain a proficiency slot when he attains his next level.
Each  application of this spell only affects a single proficiency  slot.  For
example,  if a character had specialized in a weapon, the first  use  of  the
spell would erase the benefits of specialization but not the proficiency, and
another  use  of  the  spell  could then be used to  erase  the  proficiency.
Similarly,  a  proficiency requiring two slots (healing, for  example)  would
only be reduced to half its normal ability check through a single use of this
spell.
Use  of  this  spell  on an unwilling recipient requires a successful  to-hit
roll,  and the subject still receives a saving throw versus spell. A priest's
restoration   spell  or  a  wish  can  restore  the  lost  proficiency   slot
immediately,  if  no  new  proficiency had  been  learnt  yet.  The  material
component  is a leaf from a rubber plant, which must be rubbed on the  person
to be affected.

This  spell  grants  the wizard the ability to use sonar to  "see"  and  move
safely at a normal rate in the dark, even in magical darkness. The wizard can
tell  size  and general shape of objects up to 10 yards away in any direction
he faces. The wizard must actively concentrate to "see" his surroundings, but
merely  ceasing  concentration does not end the spell,  and  the  wizard  may
resume the sonar again within the spell's duration. The material component is
a bit of bat guano.

This  spell  creates a small cyclone that moves from the wizard's finger  and
grows into a billowing white cloud from which a steady downpour of holy water
falls.
The  cloud  can be directed and controlled as long as the wizard concentrates
on  the  spell. The cloud can move with MV 6. Undead creatures  suffer  1d6+1
points  of  damage  per  round  that they  are  in  contact  with  the  rain.
Intelligent undead may save versus breath weapon for half damage.
If  the saving throw is successful, it means the undead has managed to  avoid
some  of  the  rain. The cloud's area of effect grows bigger  as  the  wizard
advances  in  levels, up to a maximum of 30-foot diameter.  As  the  area  of
effect  grows  bigger, the casting time gets longer: 1 per 2  levels  with  a
maximum of 5.
The rain from the cloud keeps falling for one round per level up to 10 rounds
at  most.  The wizard can stop the rain at any time by ceasing to concentrate
on  the cloud. The cloud can be moved by any wind with a force up to 30 miles
per hour; if the force exceeds this limit the cloud disperses.
The  rain  remains  holy only long enough to do damage;  after  it  has  made
contact with any other matter, it becomes ordinary water.

The  material components for this spell are a drop of holy water and  a  hair
from a priest of any good alignment.

Using  this  spell,  a templar can cause an intelligent creature  to  hold  a
sorcerer king in awe as well as fear him.
The  victim is allowed a saving throw versus spell at  2, with modifiers  for
Wisdom  applying.  If failed, the victim knows he faces  a  servant  of  that
sorcerer  king  and is likely to do his bidding. If unaffected,  the  subject
still  knows the identity of the caster (as a servant of that sorcerer  king)
and may act as he sees fit.
The  spell  can  be  used to impress individuals or during investigations.  A
templar  can only affect targets regarding his own sorcerer king.  The  spell
can only be cast by templars.
This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This  is  an offensive variation of dimensional teleport. Its purpose  is  to
banish (by dimensional teleport) 2 HD per level of the caster of creatures to
a  place  of the casters choice - known or envisioned (eg., to the  elemental
place of earth into the den of 20 hungry xorn).
The  saving throw of this spell is modified by -1 per two levels less of  the
target  compared to the caster or +1 per two levels greater. Excess Hit  Dice
are  not effected. Upon arriving, the targets are compelled to remain on that
plane for 1yr per level of the caster.

The  material  component  for  this spell is a platinum  bird  cage  full  of
cockatrice feathers.

Upon  casting this spell, the caster and 1 person per 3 levels of the  caster
who  are in physical contact with the caster, all of their equipment and 69kg
(150  pounds)  per  level, are instantly transported  anywhere  in  the  AD&D
multiverse that the wizard wants. An unlimited number of dimensional barriers
can be crossed (eg.: prime material plane to 666th level of the Abyss) in one
casting.  The  time  taken is approximately 5 seconds  per  barrier  crossed.
Places  that are specifically warded against dimensional travel due to  magic
or  godly  presences  cannot be reached unless the power  wills  it  so.  The
travellers in this case will arrive outside of the warded area. So,  no,  you
cannot teleport your party of Paladins into Demogorgon's palace, but you  can
get to his plane more easily.
The  caster  can  choose  a general or specific location  if  one  is  known,
otherwise  the  point of entry into the plane is random (the travellers  will
always end up in a safe place though).
People touched in the casting receive no saving throw versus this spell.

The material component is a page of dimensional formula (which requires a  17
or higher Intelligence to create, but since you are casting 9th-level spells,
you have at least 18 Intelligence anyway) that is consumed in the casting.

When cast, this spell brings into being a field of energy wherever the caster
wants  within the area of effect. The distribution of the cubes is also under
the  casters control with the exception that they must all be contiguous. The
field  itself  can be cold, hot, or electrical at the casters discretion.  It
causes  1d6  damage  plus  1 point per level (eg., a 10th-level  caster  does
1d6+10 points of damage). The damage is delivered once per round to any being
in it with a saving throw for half damage.

The  material components is a tinderbox which is destroyed when the spell  is
cast.

This  spell empowers the caster with the ability to throw powerful bolts from
his  hands  at a rate of up to 3 per round. The maximum number  that  can  be
thrown  is  equal to the caster's level divided by 2. Any not used  when  the
spell  ends  are  wasted. The number of bolts thrown in  one  round  must  be
declared  before  initiative is rolled. If none are thrown in  a  round,  the
caster may weave another spell without losing this one.
The bolts have an initiative modifier of 2. The wizard must roto-hit for each
missile  -  hits with this spell are not automatic (Dexterity bonus applies).
If  the  bolt hits, the target (if human size or smaller) must make a  saving
throw versus paralysation or be knocked over by the force of the spell.
Called  shots  can be made with this spell, knocking items  out  of  people's
hands for example. The saving throw versus paralysation remains unchanged but
the target may not necessarily be knocked over also.

The  material components are a number of gold rods, 6cm long, worth at  least
30 gp each.

This  spell  is  in many ways similar to sepia snake sigil in  the  Unearthed
Arcana in that it traps people in a shimmering field of force. The spell  can
be  cast upon an item or upon an area of up to 10 square feet per level. When
casting  the spell, the caster must specify the conditions that will set  the
spell  off.  Examples  of possible conditions are for  example:  "anyone  who
touches  my  spell books besides me", or "anyone who walks on my welcome  mat
without first saying arador".
One person per level can be named in the casting of the spell. When the spell
is  discharged,  the  target  is  trapped in  suspended  animation  inside  a
impenetrable field of force. There is no saving throw against this spell. The
only way to remove the field is to dispel it (against the caster's level), or
wish it away.

When  a  wizard  enters hand to hand combat, he better have a  very  powerful
defensive spell working in his favour. This is probably it:
The person whom this spell is cast upon is made totally immune to non-magical
weapons  and  attacks.  Furthermore, he takes  minimum  damage  from  magical
weapons of any sort. As far asspells and psionics are concerned, the immunity
provides  the equivalent protection of a mobile, one-way anti-magic shell  or
total  mind block. The wizard is also immune to normal fire, lightning,  cold
and  so  on.  Breath weapons and like attacks also automatically  do  minimum
damage. All saving throws are made at +4 for the duration of the spell.

The  material  component  of the spell is an iron bracelet  with  the  spells
Kiri's mystical coat of armour, Kiri's mystical screen, stone skin and armour
permanently cast on it.

When  cast,  this  spell brings into being a large, invisible,  insubstantial
wheel  of force centred on the caster. After the spell is completed, it comes
into  effect whenever the caster of the spell or anyone named in the  casting
is  attacked  by any hostile spell (hostile being defined as any  spell  that
will  hit or affect any target who is unaware of the spell or any spell  that
the  target actively resists regardless of whether he normally gets a  saving
throw), while within the area of effect.
Whenever  a "hostile" spell crosses the boundary of the wheel, it is absorbed
and  the  full  spell comes into effect: A brilliant, shimmering,  multi-hued
wheel of energy materializes and begins to rotate. All "hostile" spells  cast
onto or across the area of effect are absorbed into the wheel which causes it
to become brighter and spin faster.
Note: dispel magic is absorbed by the spell engine and magic resistance  does
not negate this effect. A wish will destroy one spell engine per casting.
Creatures of less than 4 HD or levels looking at the engine must save  versus
spell once per round or be blinded for 1d6 turns. The engine persists for one
turn  per  spell  level absorbed. Resting, meditation and spell  memorisation
occur  twice  as  fast  within  the area of effect  while  an  active  engine
persists.
When  the  wheel's energy is exhausted, it will lay dormant  until  activated
again.

The material component for this spell is a hollow glass wheel full of mercury
and gold, silver, or platinum dust worth 300 gp.

In all respects, this is the same as the 1st-level magic missile, except that
an  unlimited number of missiles can be created and fired at multiple targets
(cf. Snilloc's major missile in the Forgotten Realms' Handbook).

This spell creates a shimmering field of force that completely surrounds  the
recipient  and all of his equipment. The magical armour absorbs 2  points  of
damage  per  level  of  the caster. The spell protects against  physical  and
elemental attacks but not against falling damage, gas, or mental attacks.
The field offers other benefits:
           Immunity  to  vorpal, sharpness, or assassination attacks  if  the
field still stands after the attack.
          No need to save for items against breath weapon or the like, if the
field still stands.
           Pick  pockets,  poisoned attacks, and touch spells  will  have  no
effect with the field in effect.
These  benefits and others like it exist due to the fact that the body cannot
be reached until the field is destroyed.

The  material component for this spell is a gilded piece of full plate armour
of no less than 1000 gp value.

This  spell  is  an improvement over the copy spell in the Complete  Wizard's
Handbook. The spell enchants one piece of paper or parchment with the ability
to  "take  a  picture". The caster upon casting the spell merely concentrates
upon  the area to be captured on parchment and speaks the trigger word.  Both
close-up's and distance pictures are possible.

The  material  components for the spell are a set of coloured inks,  oils  or
pigments.

This spell allows a wizard to totally dominate and possess another. When  the
wizard  possesses  his target, he in effect becomes it. Therefore,  he  knows
what  abilities the possessed being has. The possessing wizard can force  the
possessed  being to use any of its powers, spells or combat abilities  at  no
penalty,  or  the  wizard  can  choose to cast his  own  spells  through  the
creature. Provided he is not casting a spell of his own through the possessed
creature, the wizard can give the creature orders and can still act fully  on
his own.
After  the  spell  has  worn off, the possessed creature  will  not  remember
anything that has happened. A saving throw versus spell is allowed to  resist
this spell.

The  material  component is a marionette attached to  strings  that  must  be
shaken as the spell is cast.

This  is  simply a more powerful version of protection from normal  missiles.
This  spell  blocks out all missiles - normal, magical, giant's rocks,  seige
missiles  and others. It also blocks out all magical spells with  a  physical
missile  component  (like flame arrow) but not fireball  and  the  like.  The
material component is an entire tortoise or turtle shell.

After  this spell is cast, a magical and very skilled servant is called  into
existence.  This  servant is a combination of butler, cook, chauffeur,  etc.,
that  can perform as well as any normal servant. They are usually created  to
"keep  house" when the caster is away for long periods of time or to help  in
magical research (feeding, fetching etc.).
The servant is AC 6 with 1 HP per level. It has no attacks.

The  material component for this spell is a butler suit and a length of  gold
wire worth 200 gp. The components are reusable.

This  morally questionable spell causes two beings or the caster and  another
being  to completely switch bodies. All skills, class abilities, hit  points,
Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma stay the same as they were in the  original
body.  The  physical statistics (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution)  are  now
those  of  the  new body (note that the hit points may have  to  be  adjusted
according  to  the  new Constitution). The same occurs to the  second  person
involved in the spell.
Unwilling participants are allowed a saving throw versus spell. If  trap  the
soul is cast at the same time, Kiri's soul transfer is saved against at -4.

The  material components of the spell amount to 7000 gp worth of preparations
taking 2 days.
This  is  a  great  spell to base adventures around - some  old  evil  wizard
looking  for  a  new, young body. The PCs must find some way to  reverse  the
process by finding the spell.

The  purpose of this spell it to turn an item (a cloak pin, for example) into
a  container  for  a second spell. The second spell must be  cast  while  the
container still persists or it will fade away and be wasted. After the second
spell is cast, it becomes "trapped" inside the enchanted container. It can be
released  any  time later when the command word is spoken that was  specified
during the casting. The released spell is then under the control of the  user
of the container.
Note  that  instantaneous spells like fireball, magic missile,  power  words,
symbols, etc., cannot be placed in a container.

The  material component of this spell is a platinum infinity symbol worth  at
least 100 gp. It is destroyed in the casting of the spell.

This  spell  calls into effect a sphere of annihilation as  per  the  Dungeon
Master's Guide's description except for two important differences:
          It cannot be created inside anything (to avoid instant deaths).
           It is always under the control of the caster and cannot be wrested
from him.

The material component is a specially prepared lodestone (details are left to
the DM).

This  spell causes small, specially crafted toy soldiers to become full  size
warriors under the wizard's command. One figure can be animated per 4  levels
of  the wizard (maximum of 4). The Armour Class of the soldier depends on the
material that it is made out of:

     Matter    AC
     clay 8
     wood 6
     stone     4
     metal     2

Each figure has 3 hit points per level of the wizard to a maximum of 45. They
attack  twice per round as fighters of half the wizard's level with  whatever
weapons  they were created with. Being mindless, they cannot be charmed,  put
to sleep, dominated, etc.

The  material component is a number of toy soldiers worth no less than 10  gp
each.

Upon  casting this spell, a tween is summoned to adopt the caster as a  host.
Upon  adapting the caster, the tween gives him all of the benefits  described
in the 1st. ed. Fiend Folio (page 91). They are: two rolls instead of one for
just  about everything (to-hit, saving throws, damage) where the caster takes
the  more beneficial roll and the opposite for foes who take the worse of two
rolls.
Tween: AC 10, HD: 1d8 + 1 per caster level, number of attacks: 1, damage:  by
weapon  type,  special  attacks: none, special defences:  etherial,  MR:  0%,
Intelligence: very, alignment: neutral, psionic abilities: none.
To  successfully  cast this spell, a gate spell to the  etherial  plane  must
first be cast successfully.

This  spell  will instantly kill the target. In order for the spell  to  take
effect,  the  priest must kiss the victim. Note that this  spell  grants  the
victim no saving throw, but has an important prerequisite: the victim of  the
spell  must  be  in  love with the priest. This love must be  non-magical  in
nature.  Furthermore, the victim may not be under the influence of any  spell
from the enchantment/charm school.
This spell may only be cast by a good-aligned priest if he himself is also in
love with the victim, and commits suicide immediately after the casting.
The  material component for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and  some
ice-water, which is to be smeared upon the priest's lips before the  kiss  of
death is delivered.

When  a  wizard  casts this spell, he must kiss the intended victim  and  the
victim must be able to receive a kiss (cannot be in combat). This is actually

after twice the normal duration. The victim of this spell will obey any order

     When a wizard casts this spell, he must kiss the intended victim and the
victim must be able to receive a kiss (cannot be in combat). After the  kiss,
the  victim  goes into a deep comatose slumber. Slapping or wounding  awakens
the  affected  creature  but normal noise does not.  Awakening  requires  one
entire  round.  The  reverse of this spell is kiss of awakening,  which  will
awaken a person who is magically asleep.

With  this  spell  a  portal to the prime custard plane  is  briefly  opened,
causing  a  cylindrical  volume of custard, 5 feet deep,  to  fall  onto  the
targets. At the time of casting the wizard must specify at what location  the
portal will open. Anyone caught in the cascade takes 1d3 damage per 10  yards
the  custard falls, and suffers the blinding effects of Klaus' krazy  kustard
pie.  The targets must make a saving throw versus spell to protect themselves
for  half  damage and prevent being blinded. Each 10 yards above the  targets
that the portal appears adds +1 to the saving throw roll, and if the modified
roll is a 20 or higher, they escape entirely. Anyone in the custard has their
movement  rate  divided by 4 for the first round and 2 for  the  next  three,
assuming the custard is free to flow away. The material component is a  pinch
of  custard  powder  (dried milk and eggs) thrown in  the  air.  It  must  be
completely dry.

This  spell  requires enough custard - which need not be fresh -  to  fill  a
small  bowl.  The  custard is expanded into 2d6+1 per level  custard-coloured
coypu  (large  beaver-like South American rodents). They will rapidly  attach
themselves to the nearest humanoids (within 5 yards if possible, but probably
only  up  to 3 coypu per person) and mill inquisitively around them  wherever
they  go  saying "Nyip!" repeatedly in a most annoying fashion.  Victims  who
fail to save versus spell attack the coypu in preference to the real targets,
unless the real targets are attacking them as well. Spellcasters who fail  an
Intelligence roll are distracted. Coypu harassing a person will impede  them,
reducing their movement rate by 3 per coypu. If they try to move faster there
is  a  30% chance per round (for a medium-sized creature) of tripping over  a
coypu,  15% for large and small creatures. If any coypu are attacked,  harmed
or  have someone trip over them, all coypu attached to the person in question
will  promptly become slavering killer coypu and attack them until  slain  or
the  spell  expires. They have 1 HD, AC 8 and a THAC0 of  18  with  one  bite
attack  for 1d4 points of damage. When the spell expires, they dissolve  into
gooey custard.

When  this  spell is cast on a small amount of custard or custard powder,  it
becomes  infected  with a mildly contagious cough capable  of  affecting  one
humanoid  (not  the spellcaster) on contact within the spell's duration.  The
custard  can  be  delivered by any means including using it as  the  material
component for another kustard-type spell. The victim must save versus  poison
(at  +2 if none of the custard is at all ingested) to resist the effects. The
illness  causes frequent but mild coughing fits which expel small amounts  of
custard  instead of phlegm. Humanoids near the victim must also  save  at  +2
when  coughing  is  going on. Anyone who saves is immune to  that  particular
casting of the spell. The illness has a short duration of only 6d8 hours  and
an  incubation  period of 1 hour. Every round there is a 50%  chance  that  a
victim  will be affected, unable to cast spells and with a -4 penalty to-hit.
material component is a bit of rotten custard.

      With  this spell the caster conjures a gooey custard pie which  he  can
hurl  at one creature within range. The caster must roll to hit the creature,
ignoring  its armour, but Dexterity and magical bonuses apply. If the  caster
hits, the pie has struck the creature in the face, and the creature must make
a  saving  throw  versus spell, or be blinded. The creature  must  spend  1d3
rounds clearing its face.

      The  target  is unlikely to appreciate this, especially if  the  caster
gloats.  The material component for this spell is a small amount of  custard,
which  is  consumed  in  the casting. Being hit alone is  enough  to  disrupt
spellcasting.

From  a small dollop of custard (the material component of this spell),  this
spell creates a mobile blob of corrosive, slow-moving custard about two  feet
in diameter. It can change its form and move at a speed of 4. It has 5 HD, AC
8  and  a  THAC0 of 16, and corrodes things it comes into contact  with  (see
Puddings, Deadly for other general details). This effect is weak and will not
take  effect until the end of the round after contact. The affected area will
smoke  (if metal), sting (if skin), etc., giving warning and time to try  and
remove  the  remaining  custard. Damage to creatures  is  2d6,  halved  by  a
successful saving throw versus acid. The blob is unlikely to destroy a  heavy
obstacle  such  as  a  thick  metal door or stone  slab  during  the  spell's
duration.  The  blob is controlled by the caster, but does  not  need  to  be
actively  concentrated on to continue with its tasks and  can  be  instructed
during the round of casting. After the spell expires, the custard reverts  to
a normal dollop.

This  spell is similar to Klaus' krazy kustard pie (q.v.), but it is  capable
of  homing  unerringly  on  its  target's  visual  apparatus,  even  rounding
obstacles,  however far the target flees. It flies at speed 30, attacks  with
the  caster's  THAC0 and can turn back for one attack every  round  until  it
hits, is destroyed or the spell expires. It has AC 7 and will disintegrate on
taking  4  points  of  damage. Naturally, trying to evade  the  pie  disrupts
spellcasting.

      This  spell is cast on a container, and over the duration of the  spell
all the custard within range of the container is drawn in towards it. Custard
securely  contained  elsewhere will not be able to move, and  custard  behind
solid objects may take some time to get around them; otherwise all custard in
range  will  probably  be in the container (space permitting)  within  twenty
seconds  or so. The container can be moved around to pick up custard  from  a
larger  area.  This spell would be useful for clearing up laboratories  after
failed  attempts  to research other custard spells. The container  used  will
disappear  at  the  end of the spell's duration, since  it  is  the  material
component of the spell.

The  material component of this spell is a blob of custard in each hand. When
cast,  1d6 + 1 per level curling, intertwining layers of custard burst  forth
from  the  caster's  fingertips. The streams can first be aimed  at  multiple
targets if desired. Any creature hit by the custard must save versus spell or
suffer  the  effects of Klaus' krazy kustard pie, and in any case is  knocked
down  if  hit by enough custard (tiny sized creatures will always be  knocked
down  by  one  stream, small two, medium by four, large by  eight,  giant  by
sixteen). Subtract 20% chance per stream below the required number,  and  10%
for each extra leg beyond two possessed by the target creature.

When  this  spell is cast on a cloak, then that cloak cannot be  affected  by
custard (magical or non-magical) except that resulting from spells of  fourth
level and above, and will move to protect its wearer. For example, if a large
amount of custard lands on the wearer's head, the hood (if down) will lift up
and  the  custard  will run off. None of the effects will  penetrate  to  the
protected  person.  If  necessary, the cloak can totally  seal  up  over  the
wearer's face to prevent them being drowned by custard or blinded by  a  pie.
It  is  advisable  to  use a hooded cloak with this spell.  The  cloak  turns
custard-coloured  for  the  duration and returns to  normal  afterwards.  The
material component for this spell is a miniature umbrella.

This  spell  is cast while pouring some sour custard (the material component)
onto  the  ground. The custard spreads rapidly outwards and forms a  circular
quagmire; the caster can control the rate of growth to give himself  time  to
get  away.  The  sides of the quagmire are extremely steep, and  the  surface
consists  mostly  of the material that was there originally  (albeit  with  a
yellow tinge) making it difficult to notice except for the smell of off milk.
Creatures  of  small size or larger falling in will sink whenever  they  move
significantly - probably submerging after eight movements for small creatures
and  four for medium ones. Large creatures will sink much faster, but the pit
will  probably not be deep enough to drown them. Unless the victims can  find
something to pull themselves out with, they will probably have to wait  until
the  spell expires when they become trapped in solid ground and must  be  dug
out  of whatever encases them. Move rate when touching the bottom is 1, or  2
if  an open doors roll can be made. If people approach the quagmire they will
suspect something if they roll a 1-2 on 1d6, or (if hurrying) on a 1 only. If
successful, a Dexterity roll will allow them to avoid falling in, with  a  -2
penalty if there is nothing nearby to grab hold of.

This  spell  can  only  be  cast by druids. The druid  seeks  one  animal  of
Intelligence  2-6 that inhabits his guarded lands. He can then  befriend  the
animal and make it to agree to become his assistant.
The  druid must converse with the animal and persuade it to help him. He  can
then  assign  it  specific tasks, always according to its  Intelligence.  The
animal  will carry the assignment out, as best as it can. Animals  with  high
enough  Intelligence  may,  at  the DM's discretion,  offer  their  permanent
services to the druid if the reason is well justified (such as watch  over  a
critical place of the guarded lands). Examples of assignments are:
           The  animal  must guard an area for a specified  period  of  time,
during the druid's absence.
           The  animal must investigate an area and then report back  to  the
druid.
           The  animal  must  guard a specific individual  until  a  specific
condition is met (he fulfils a task, a period of time passes, etc.).
          The animal must accompany the druid until he releases it.
The druid must burn various herbs and incense for three hours, while he calls
upon a member of the wanted species to come to him. At the end of the casting
time  the  animal comes and then the druid converses with it. A saving  throw
versus  spell  determines  the success (if it fails,  the  animal  obeys  the
druid).
If  the  reasons for the summons do not further the druid's ethos, the spirit
of  the  land may look with disfavour upon the druid (for example,  summoning
the animal only to kill and eat it).
In  addition  to the herbs and incense required, the druid must also  make  a
sacrifice  of a valuable item during the casting. This includes  anything  of
value,  be it a ceramic coin or a fruit of health. The item may have a  value
proportionate  to  the  importance of the assignment, although  this  is  not
strictly necessary. This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

By  means of this spell, the caster creates a number of insubstantial "hands"
that  he  can  use  to assist him in various processes. The number  of  hands
equals one per three levels (or fraction) of experience of the caster.
The  hands cannot be used to attack or defend but can otherwise be  used  for
any  normal purpose, as if they were physical appendages of the caster.  They
possess   a  Strength  equal  to  the  caster's.  Examples  of  use   include
housekeeping  jobs, climbing (bonus +10% per hand), holding other  characters
or items, etc.
Whatever  weight  the hands carry, it is in addition to any allowed  for  the
caster.  In  any  case, the DM must judge whether the attempted  actions  are
within reason (each hand can only do things a normal hand can).
This  spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign  world.  The  spell  was
created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

With  this spell the caster creates a number of insubstantial hands that  can
be used for defense or other purposes.
The number of hands equals one per three levels of the caster. They are AC  1
and  can  be  hit by magical weapons or effects; they have a  number  of  hit
points equal to the level of the caster each.
The  hands  can  wield weapons, not larger than a short  sword.  They  cannot
attack  but  they can use the weapons to parry any melee attacks towards  the
caster.  To  parry the attack, the hand must make an attack roll against  the
attacker's Armour Class; if successful, the attack has been parried  and  the
damage is suffered by the hand. Each hand can parry only one melee attack per
round.
When  not wielding weapons, the hands can be used for other purposes. A  hand
has a Strength of 18 for purposes of lifting, carrying or smashing. The hands
can never move more than 10 feet away from the caster. The caster can dictate
their actions mentally, at all times, as if they were his own.
This  spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign  world.  The  spell  was
created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

This  is an advanced version of the 2nd-level weave knots (q.v.). It has  all
functions listed there, and more.
The  second spell must be cast immediately after knots and binds is cast (add
the  two casting times together). Alternatively, two wizards can work on such
knots  - one casts this spell, the other casts the intended spell, then  they
combine their efforts.
If  the added spell is instantaneous, the second spell will not activate when
it  is  cast,  but  rather, its potential will be stored in the  thread.  The
wizard has the option when the knot spell is cast as to whether permanent  or
special duration spells are activated when the knot is tied, or when the knot
is  untied. In such cases, the target is the person to whom the knot is tied,
or the person who untied the knot.
Only  spells  that are either area effect, or personal effect  can  be  used.
Aimed  or  directional spells cannot be stored in the knot.  For  example,  a
fireball would work (ground zero is the knot), but a lightning bolt or  magic
missile wouldn't.
The level of the spell cast into it is restricted by the wizard's level:

     Wizard's Level Spell Level
     7-8  2nd
     9-11 3rd
     12+  4th

The  stored energy will last for 2 days per level of the wizard, in the  case
of  instantaneous spells, until it dissipates harmlessly or until  the  knots
are  undone  or  the  rope  is cut, at which time  the  spell's  effects  are
unleashed (on half normal effect). The object the knots are on is the  target
of  the  spell as well as the person who cutthe knot. If the knots aren't  on
anything, the person who undid or cut the knots is the target.
In  the  case of permanent or special duration spells, the spell is generally
ended when the knot is untied or cut.
To  actually get the knot onto someone, the caster of the knot spell must get
within  5  yards  of  the  target.  The enchanted  bonds  will  then  entwine
themselves onto the target.
Detect magic will show that the knots are magical in nature. If dispel  magic
is  cast  onto  the  knots, two checks are needed. If the knot  spell  itself
becomes  dispelled,  then the contained spell needs  to  be  tested.  If  the
contained  spell survives the dispel magic, it activates. If the  knot  spell
survives, the contained spell automatically survives.
Typical applications of this spell are:
           A  curse  is woven into the ribbon, and it is attached to someone.
For the duration of the curse, the person suffers the curse's effects.
          A fireball is cast on a section of rope, used to tie shut a bag. If
someone  opens the bag, the fireball goes off into his face. The  wizard  can
untie the bag safely, and retie it.
           An  armour is cast on a section of rope. The wizard keeps the rope
in his pocket and, if attacked, unties the knot.
Material  components  are a section of rope, twine  or  ribbon  that  becomes
knotted which is not consumed at the end of the spell. Also required is  some
blood of the wizard (just a few drops).

     This spell enables the caster to know the profession (or class, if there
is  no  real profession) of a creature or object (this applies to magic items
that  are class-specific). Concentration for more than one round will  reveal
whether  the  target  has more than one class. The caster  sees  an  aura  as
follows:

Colour    Class
-----------------
Red         Fighter
Green       Ranger
Brown       Druid
Blue        Paladin
Silver      Wizard*
Yellow      Priest
Grey        Monk
Black       Thief
Orange      Bard
Violet      **

* Specialists appear as any other.
**  This  appears if the target is in an official position of authority  (not
just party leadership or such).

      Every  round of concentration, the DM should roll randomly which colour
appears,  if  more than one is viable. The same colour may appear  more  than
once before all possible colours have been noticed.

      By  casting  this spell, an apprentice or wizard is able to  tell  what
quality  of wine or champagne he is drinking. This spell will let the  caster
know by quickly flashing a colour, on the surface of the drink, corresponding
to  the level of quality. It will also warn of possible spoilage (but not  of
poison).  The  colour black means poor or bad quality.  Blue  means  good  or
average  quality. A light blue means very good and white means excellent.  If
the  flash is black and red, the wine is spoilt. This spell was developed  by
apprentices  who  were tired of getting poor-quality wines for  dinner.  They
also didn't want to keep being ripped off in pubs. The material component for
this spell is a white feather.

      This  cantrip  enables the wizard to read the aura of a  creature.  The
caster  must  remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for  two  full
rounds. A creature is allowed a saving throw versus spell and, if successful,
the  caster  learns nothing about the particular creature from  the  casting.
Certain magical devices negate this cantrip.

       The  reverse,  undetectable  sexual  alignment,  conceals  the  sexual
preference  of  a creature for 24 hours - even from a know sexual  preference
cantrip.

      By  use  of  this spell, an apprentice or wizard is able  to  tell  the
vintage  (year)  of  one  siingle bottle of wine or  champagne.  It  is  also
possible to tell, with a 10% chance of failure, the vineyard or winery  where
the  wine  came from. This spell is very useful for those who  are  not  sure
about  a  particular bottle of wine. A small drop of wine from the bottle  is
necessary to cast the spell.

Occasionally, when one comes across a partially buried object or a deposit of
some substance, it would be beneficial to know the general size and shape  of
the  thing.  When a wizard casts this and touches a continuous  substance  or
artifact,  he obtains a clear idea of the thing's size and shape.  Continuous
mineral  deposits, buried buildings, continuous wall systems, and other  such
objects  of  uniform make or substance can be subjects for this spell.  Their
extent  is  revealed to the wizard instantly, but if the sheer  size  of  the
object is greater than 2 miles per level along any axis, or if the object  is
extradimensionally  active,  then  the  casting  wizard  must   save   versus
paralysation or fall unconscious for 1d10 rounds, after which their  idea  of
its extent can be summed up as "pretty darn big!".

Korel's  death aura creates continual small magical effects in  its  area  of
effect,  which  is mobile with and centred on the caster. These  effects  are
very  subtle  and  should not be immediately recognized  as  magical  by  the
player.
The  effects are centred around death and fear. For instance, those  entering
the  area of effect might notice a slight stuffiness in the air, making it  a
little  difficult to breathe. Slight movements seen out of the corner of  the
eye  with  no  visible  source should keep people on edge  and  maybe  a  bit
paranoid.  A slight cold breeze seems to blow across the back of one's  neck,
for instance. The manipulation of shadows is a favourite, as well.
Once  per  round, the caster may concentrate and direct these effects  -  for
instance,  sending a shiver down someone's spine while staring  at  them,  or
cause a shadow to move out of the corner of that person's eye to distract him
for a second.
In  no  way will these effects cause damage or distract spellcasting, unless,
of  course,  the spellcaster voluntarily stops to see what just  moved  "over
there  in  the corner". By concentrating, more explicit effects can  also  be
generated: the caster's eyes glow red, etc.
The caster may, with minor concentration, temporarily negate the effects.  At
the  caster's  option,  auditory phantasms may  also  be  created:  a  slight
scuffling  or  scraping sound off in the corner where the  shadow  seemed  to
move, a distant scream so faint you're not sure whether you heard it or  not,
the  whistling  wind  seeming to be calling your name, etc.  The  option  for
auditory elements is set at casting time.

archmage  Zagig. This spell is very similar to enchant an item,  except  that
the objects to be enchanted are living plants, not special items.
To  use  this  spell,  the  plants to be enchanted  must  first  be  located.
Different types of plants can hold different levels of magic. Common  plants,
like  tulips, grasses, and oaks, can only be enchanted with cantrips or magic
of  the  same  order of strength. These effects are commonly  used  with  the
colour cantrip to produce blue roses, or with an exterminate cantrip to repel
insects, etc.
Rarer  plants,  particularly those with medicinal or magical  value,  can  be
enchanted  with  1st-  or 2nd-level spells, either wizard  or  priest.  These
effects  are commonly used to create berry bushes whose berries  act  as  the
spell goodberry, for instance, or flowers whose scent acts as sleep.
To  enchant plants with higher level spells is possible, but it is  necessary
to   seek  out  truly  exceptional  plants.  In  no  cases  can  plants  with
intelligence of their own be enchanted with this spell.
To  enchant  a plant with a specific spell, it is necessary to research  this
new  application of the spell as if it were a new spell. In the process,  the
DM and the player should collaborate on possibly altered effects of the spell
in  question - for instance, if the spell is instantaneous, how often can the
plant cast that spell, or under what conditions (when touched, when struck by
sunlight, etc.).
This  spell  is cast on a batch of seeds. Up to 3d8 may be enchanted  at  one
time. To prepare for the enchantment, the parent plants of the seeds must  be
grown with special care: special fertilizers, watered with pure spring water,
no  damaging  weather,  etc. The cost varies with the  plant  (an  oak  would
require more fertilizer than grass, and for a longer period) but should never
be  less  than  100 gp per parent plant. Each parent plant may  produce  many
seeds,  according  to  species. The seeds themselves,  after  the  enchanting
process, must be planted under the next full moon or the enchantment is lost.
The  enchanting  process  is similar to enchant  an  item,  with  the  caster
required  to be in proximity to the seeds during that time. The casting  time
is  10d6  hours, with a maximum of 8 hours a day. The spells to be  enchanted
must be cast within 24 hours of the conclusion of the enchanting process, and
they  require 1d6 hours per spell level. Continuing enchantment is  possible,
as  with  enchant an item. The seeds must roll a savings throw equal  to  the
caster's  unmodified  saving  throw versus polymorph  -  if  successful,  the
enchantment took. If the saving throw was failed, the enchantment failed  and
the seeds are ruined. The caster is aware of the result of the saving throw.
If  the process is stopped here, the seeds, when planted, will grow to plants
that exhibit the spells they were enchanted with, but their seeds will result
in plants of the normal form. If permanency is applied to the seedswithin the
24  hours period, then the form of the plants are permanently changed  -  the
offspring  of  the  plants  will also exhibit  the  magical  properties,  and
essentially a new species of plant has been created, with all the  associated
potential for crossbreeding, etc.

In casting this spell, the wizard severs the victim's control over one of his
arms  (75%  chance primary hand, even chance if the victim is  ambidextrous),
making  the  victim's  hand an independent entity  whose  only  goal  is  the
destruction of the victim.
The  hand  is almost as intelligent as the victim, and will use the  quickest
available method for killing or disabling the victim (note that the hand  can
continue attacking even if the victim is unconscious). For instance,  if  the
victim  was  carrying a dagger, the hand might grab that and attack.  If  the
victim is weaponless, the hand would attempt to choke instead. The hand would
not,  however, be able to grab a wand and fire it at the victim, since a wand
requires a command word to activate.
With  weapons, the hand only uses short weapons, since anything longer cannot
be  easily turned inward. It attacks with the victim's own THAC0 against  the
victim's  own  Armour  Class,  doing the victim's  normal  damage,  including
Strength  bonuses. For choking, the hand inflicts 1d4 points of  damage  each
round,  plus  Strength bonus if applicable (75% of this is temporary  damage,
but remember that the hand can continue choking the victim even if the victim
is  unconscious). Each round, if no other action is taken, the victim  has  a
50%  chance of breaking the choke hold (the hand may re-establish it  with  a
successful  attack  roll). Other attack forms are up to the  DM's  discretion
(bashing plates into the victim's head, etc.).
Even  though necromancers generally dislike charm spells, this spell provides
many a laugh for them. The material component is fingernail clippings from  a
zombie.

      Korel  the necromancer created this spell as a way to deal with insults
in taverns. Being Suloise, dressed in black, and not at all personable tended
to  draw the hecklers. Unfortunately, there was little for him to do short of
killing the person, which would be too much of a nuisance.

     Thus he made this spell, which is essentially a "silence, 2-inch radius"
spell.  Typical  use  is  to  cast  it on  someone's  tongue,  rendering  all
articulated speech impossible (spellcasting too), although deep-throat  moans
might  still  be possible. The victim can still hear, though, a necessity  in
getting  in your last word. The sphere is mobile with the object it was  cast
upon.

     The somatic component is a wave of dismissal in the subject's direction,
and  the verbal component is some phrase like "be quiet", "shut up", or  some
more  colourful version. A successful saving throw against spells  completely
negates the effect, but the victim will not know that a spell was even  cast,
due to the innocuous nature of the components. This was specifically designed
to  prevent secondary insults regarding the failure of the spell ("Hah!  Your
feeble magics cannot touch me!").

      Magic using thieves can also use this spell by casting it on a lock  to
cover  up  lock  picking noises, while still keeping an ear out  for  guards'
footsteps. Creaking hinges are another good use. It's also a good way to shut
up  the stupid Intelligence 8 dwarven battlerager in the party, although this
may result in a two-handed battle-axe between the eyes.

This  spell  was designed by Korel the Necromancer, who was eager  to  create
undead,  but  too cultivated to accept the reek of rotting flesh produced  by
zombies.  The casting of this spell summons a horde of insects which  rapidly
devour  all the flesh from the corpses of a number of creatures. To determine
how  many  creatures can be skeletonized with one casting, use the guidelines
of animate dead (one body per level of humans, less for higher Hit Dice).
Note that the body must be completely dead (-10 HP, not just unconscious at 0
HP). Only the bare bones are left behind, completely clean after a rinsing of
water.
The spell may also function on animated undead, in which case a savings throw
is  granted to negate the effect. Failure results in the loss of one Hit Die.
Obviously, skeletons are immune. Free-willed undead are also immune.

The  material  component is a large pinch of sugar mixed  with  bone  powder,
which must be sprinkled over the bodies to be affected.

This  spell,  when cast on an already animated undead, presumedly  under  the
caster's  control, strengthens both the body of the undead and the  animating
force  holding it together. The result is an increase in most of the physical
statistics  of  combat, producing an excellent skeletal  bodyguard  or  elite
troops.
The  effects of this spell depend on the caster's level. Subtract 10 from the
level  of the caster and divide by two. This modifier (2 at fourteenth level,
3  at  sixteenth  level, 4 at eighteenth level) is applied  in  the  positive
direction to all of the following: THAC0, Hit Dice, Armour Class, and  damage
modifier. Thus, a 14th-level caster could strengthen a normal skeleton (THAC0
19, 1 HD, AC 7, no damage modifier) to an advanced model with THAC0 17, 3 HD,
AC 5, and a +2 damage modifier.
Free-willed  undead  are not affected by this spell,  nor  are  non-corporeal
undead,  since  the  spell  strengthens the  physical  body  of  the  undead.
Skeletons,  zombies,  and  ju-ju zombies are the typical  recipients  of  the
spell.

The material component for this spell is a pinch of dust from a normal undead
of  the  new Hit Dice or higher (wraith at 5, mummy at 6, etc.) and a cup  of
blood  from a fighter with the same THAC0 as the new level. These  are  mixed
together and splashed on the undead to be affected.

This  spell imbues one weapon with a shimmering black radiance that makes  it
function  as  a weapon of vampiric regeneration for the spell duration.  That
is,  one  half of any damage inflicted by the weapon (including  bonuses  for
Strength,  magic,  backstab  multipliers, etc.) is  gained  by  the  wielder,
rounded down.
The spell enchants the weapon, not a person, so the weapon may be used by the
caster or another person, or even by several people in succession within  the
spell  duration. For the purposes of this spell, a weapon is defined  as  any
non-living  object  through which damage is inflicted.  Common  weapons  like
swords  and  staves are obviously included, but the spell could theoretically
be  used to enchant a pair of gloves to regenerate punching damage. In a case
like  this,  only  the permanent damage is counted for determining  how  many
points are regenerated.
Hit  points may be gained by the wielder above the normal maximum, and excess
points  are  treated  as  in a vampiric touch (fades  after  one  hour).  The
material  component of this spell is a pinch of dust from  a  level  draining
undead  (wraith, wight, spectre, vampire), which is sprinkled over the weapon
to be affected.

This  spell  imbues a formerly mindless undead (typically  a  skeleton  or  a
zombie  -  free-willed  undead  cannot  be  affected  by  this  spell)   with
Intelligence.  In  the  casting of this spell, the subject's  brain,  or  the
remains thereof, is removed and replaced with a specially prepared gem.
The  crystalline  structure of the gem acts as a focus to draw  together  and
intensify  the  dark  forces already present in  the  undead,  giving  it  an
Intelligence  of its own, determined by the size and perfection  of  the  gem
(see the table below). In no case can the Intelligence of the undead meet  or
exceed the caster's Intelligence at the time of casting.
Although  the  undead has Intelligence, it does not have free will  -  it  is
still  subservient  to its master (usually the caster).  However,  the  added
Intelligence enables it to remember and carry out more complex commands  and,
within  certain limits, even display some initiative. The undead have  access
to  the  minds  of  the countless deceased to some extent,  so  other  skills
appropriate to the Intelligence level can be possessed, particularly  if  the
living person whose animated body is affected displayed them.
For  example, the animated body of a deceased general would almost  certainly
retain an understanding of battlefield strategy if given enough Intelligence.
Likewise,  an  animated  warrior  would  retain  his  fighting  prowess,  and
therefore  his  original  THAC0. Psionic or spellcasting  abilities  are  not
retained,  however,  since they either require living flesh  or  have  to  be
extensively adapted to the new relation to the negative material plane.

     Gem Value Intelligence   Skills (cumulative)
     10 gp     1-2  One immediate command
     20 gp     3-4  Command activated by condition
     50 gp     5-6  Simple strategies, like ambush
     100 gp    7-8  Multi-step, conditional commands
     200 gp    9-10 Average servant skills (cook, clean)
     500 gp    11-12     Can command other undead with permission
     1000 gp   13-14     Effective use of mid-sized group
     2000 gp   15-16     Effective command of troops
     5000 gp   17-18     Impersonation of humans
     10,000 gp 19-20     Extremely cunning

In any event, general Intelligence is gained, along with the ability to speak
with  a  hollow, sepulchral tone (the gem is emitting the sound, which echoes
in  the  otherwise hollow skull). The undead can perform at a level given  by
the  table  above. They can display initiative within their  orders,  but  no
more: an animated general given the order "take these troops and defeat  that
army",  would  do  so  to  the  best  of his ability,  utilizing  appropriate
battlefield tactics. However, he would not break off the attack to inform his
master that the army is actually composed of allies.
At  the higher levels of intelligence, there are rumours that the undead gain
levels of self-consciousness. They are forbidden by the spell from disobeying
their orders in the slightest or taking actions not supported by orders,  but
they can use badly formulated orders to the disadvantage of their master.  In
the  former  example, for instance, a very intelligent undead  general  might
order  his troops to concentrate on the leaders of the friendly army, knowing
them to be friends of the caster. Nevertheless, the draw for necromancers  to
create  such undead is immense, since they can be given very general commands
-  a  super-genius skeleton (esa disguised one) single-mindedly pursuing  the
goal of killing a single person can do so in unbelievably cunning ways.
Should the caster die, the undead affected by this spell gradually gain their
own  free  will,  retaining the Intelligence, over  a  period  of  one  year.
Defeating  one  of these undead in battle has a 30% chance  of  smashing  the
skull  of the undead, therefore destroying the gem in a backlash of energies.
Otherwise, the gem may be extracted and reused.

The  material component of this spell is a gem of the appropriate  size  that
has  been  soaked  in the blood of a creature with at least the  Intelligence
desired  for 24 hours. Some casters, with compunctions against killing  other
sentient   creatures,  use  their  own  blood,  but  this   rapidly   becomes
impractical.

This  spell affects the mind and body in such a way that the willpower to  do
anything  is lost. Anything attempted will be done in a half-hearted  manner;
if  things  can't  be  done easily then the spell's victim  simply  will  not
bother. For example, if a chest is locked no attempt will be made to open  it
as the first and simplest option is not available.
Physical effect: lose 1 point of Strength and Constitution every 3 turns. The
material component is the priest's holy symbol.

Kuglan's key warden is usable only by conjurer specialist wizards. It enables
the conjurer to summon a seven-foot tall, shadowy humanoid - known only as  a
key warden or key master. The key warden (HD 4+4, AC 2, Strength 18/51, 1 AT,
damage 1d6+3, THAC0 14) will fight only to defend itself. The creature, whose
essence  comes from the plane of shadow, wears a belt pouch (under  its  dark
cloak)  containing duplicates of all of the keys the wizard has  seen,  at  a
maximum distance of 20 feet, or touched within the last one day per level  of
the wizard.
The  warden is summoned to assist in opening doors, chests, and other  locked
objects.  The conjurer may command it to unlock or open doors (etc.),  within
spell  range, by employing either the keys or its strength. If  none  of  the
keys  unlocks  the object, the Warden, which never speaks, will  bow  to  the
wizard  and  wait for the conjurer's command to forcibly open the  portal  or
object. If the conjurer so bids the warden, it will attempt to break down  or
break open the door or object, employing its strength (Open Doors: 13 in  20,
25% Bend Bars/Lift Gates).
The  key  warden's body and keys vanish if the creature is slain; the  Warden
and  its  keys vanish at the end of the spell's duration, otherwise. The  key
warden  will  not  give the keys to anyone, including  the  wizard,  and,  if
someone  is  somehow able to steal any keys, the stolen keys will immediately
vanish.  The  warden may be commanded to unlock or open  as  many  doors  and
objects  as  the  conjurer desires, within the spell's range and  duration  -
taking one round per opening. The warden will only respond to commands by the
wizard that involve unlocking or opening.
Material components for the spell are five keys: one of gold, one of  silver,
one  of  iron,  one  of  brass, and one of mithril. The  components  are  not
consumed by the casting, and may be used again.
This  source  of  this  spell  is  the  Kuglan  Shadowgate  of  Melvaunt,  an
industrious mid-level conjurer who enjoys good relations with the Zhentarim.

single discharge of colostrum.

With this spell, the wizard re-lives the last minute of the recipient's life.
If the victim was conscious during this minute, the wizard must make a system
shock  check or be knocked out for 1d4 hours. The material components  are  a
convex lens and a scalpel.

      When the wizard casts this spell, he sees whatever the recipient corpse
saw at the very instant of death, with the intent of learning the identity of
the  murderer, or at least the location of death. If the recipient was killed
by a gaze attack, the wizard suffers this attack as well, but with a +4 bonus
to his saving throw.

This  spell  causes  all undead of lower level than the  priest,  within  the
range,  to  glow with a pale blue radiance equivalent to faerie fire  (unless
they  make their saving throw). This glow causes no damage to the undead  nor
does  it  inhibit  them in any way, it simply outlines the  presence  of  the
undead to others.
The  material  components for the spell are the priest's holy  symbol  and  a
crystal  bead  which  has  had a continual light cast  upon  it,  the  latter
component is consumed in the casting.

This spell conjures a bolt of molten lava which the caster may throw as if he
were  a  fighter  of  equal level (Dexterity bonuses apply).  If  it  hits  a
creature, it takes 3d6 impact damage plus 3d6 fire damage; unless the lava is
somehow removed, the target will take another 3d6 each round, for 1 round for
every  3 levels beyond fifth of the caster (1 extra round at eighth, 2  extra
at  eleventh, etc.). The material component is a piece (at least 2 ounces) of
pumice, volcanic glass, or other lava-based rock.

This  spell  will conjure up one 6 foot high lava monster. The  monster  will
have  3+2 HD, MV 60 feet per round. It hits twice for 1d3 (blow) + 1d8 (fire)
points of damage. A successful hit can cause paper or cloth to burn, and boil
liquids  (make  saving throws). The lava monster can in a last  ditch  effort
summon up all its power and throw a 10-foot diameter ball of magma up  to  50
feet  causing  3d8 points of damage. Anything immune to fire  will  take  1d3
points of damage from the light force of the blow. Any native to the plane of
magma,  earth, or fire can dispel the monster with a touch, including another
lava  monster.  The monster will instantly harden if it moves  more  than  40
yards  away  from the priest. It can be hit by normal weapons.  The  material
component for this spell is a rock and an open fire, the latter of  which  is
not extinguished.

This  spell is similar to lava bolt except that it conjures a wave of  molten
lava  over the given area. All creatures within take 1d6 per 2 levels of  the
caster  (rounded up; maximum 6); unless a successful saving  throw  is  made,
this  damage will continue, at the rate of 3d6 per round, for 1 round  per  3
levels  of  the caster beyond fourth. The material component is 4  ounces  of
volcanic  rock, and an open flame of any kind (the flame is not  extinguished
in the casting).

This  spell heals damage much like the paladin ability of the same name. When
the  priest casts lay on hands and touches the recipient, 2 points of  damage
per  experience level of the priest are healed. See the 1st-level cure  light
wounds for any restrictions on what creatures can be healed.
The reverse of the spell, harmful hands, does 2 points of damage per level of
the priest to opponents if a successful attack roll is made.

This  spell allows the caster to change his form to that of another seductive
being  for  an extended period of time. He retains all of his own  abilities,
and  gains  all of the natural abilities though none of the magical abilities
of  the  creature  chosen.  There is no danger of identity  loss  as  with  a
Polymorph.  The  types  of beings that may be impersonated  are  as  follows:
dryad,  succubus,  nereid, siren, medusa, mermaid, sylph,  unicorn,  vampire,
foxwoman. Other similar beings may be allowed at the discretion of the DM, as
the  spell  works  by allowing similar types of creatures to  become  similar
types  of  creatures, rather than the specific forms being  locked  into  the
spell.

This  spell  discerns  the  nature of what the  victim  would  consider  most
sexually  and physically attractive. The spell will make a number of attempts
to  uncover this information equal to the level of the caster, or  until  the
information  is  procured.  Each attempt takes  one  round,  and  the  victim
receives a saving throw against each attempt. Regardless of whether or not he
makes his saving throw, he will under no circumstances notice this aspect  of
the spell.
This  information will be relayed to the caster, who may then opt to activate
the  second  half  of the spell, which is to shapechange into  the  form  the
information  would dictate. If the caster does not, he may apply  the  unused
attempts against someone else, or give up the spell. If the caster does,  the
new form can be assumed for at most one week per attempt left.
Example:  Layla  wishes  to infiltrate a party using this  spell.  She  casts
against  the Dirdan the fighter first, and he fails his saving throw  on  her
second  attempt.  She  finds  he prefers dirty  half-orc  women  -  a  really
distasteful  idea.  Since  she is seventeenth level,  she  has  fifteen  more
attempts to direct against the rest of the party. On attempt seven, she finds
that  Alex  the  wizard would really like a six-foot tall snow  elf  who  was
wearing  black  leather.  Layla  finds  this  more  acceptable,  forgoes  her
remaining eight attempts, and changes shape into a snow elf. The spell  makes
her  clothing into black leather (without destroying or altering any  of  its
previous properties) and makes her staff into a bull whip. After three weeks,
she gets bored of Alex, and ends the spell, changing back to her normal self.
Since  she  had 8 attempts left when she decided to change shape,  she  could
have remained a snow elf for five more weeks, had she wanted to.

#9#
This  very  potent abjuration is used to protect a castle, keep,  city,  etc.
from one or more enemy spells. For each level the wizard has obtained, he may
protect up to a 100 square foot section of wall; more than one application of
this  spell  may be cast on a single wall at once, as long as  the  areas  of
protection  do not overlap (the wizard may shrink the area of effect  to  any
size less than the maximum, as desired); in other words, no one brick of  the
wall  may  be under protection by more than one spellstopper at a  time.  The
protection  afforded  by  this spell extends to  individuals  on  top  of  an
affected wall.
Spellstopper  may  be used to affect one other spell for each  level  of  the
wizard;  thus,  a 19th-level wizard may provide protection against  19  other
spells  directed  at the protected area. These affected  spells  may  be  any
spells,  with  the  exception of wish and dispel magic; however,  the  chosen
spells must be ones the wizard already has learned. Once this spell is  cast,
any  of the chosen spells directed at the protected area automatically  fail;
spellstopper has no effect on other spells.
Spellstopper  may be removed by wish or it may be dispelled. For  every  non-
chosen  spell  cast  at  the  area  of  effect,  the  chance  for  dispelling
spellstopper is increased a percentage equal to the level of the spell.  This
bonus is cumulative (up to 25%) and lasts for one turn. In order to earn this
bonus, the wall itself must be targeted; an attack directed at a defender  on
top of the wall does not contribute to this bonus.
As  an  example, let us assume a wall is protected from, among other  spells,
passwall, and magic missile, and that fireball and transmute rock to mud  are
not  affected. On the first round, magic missile is directed at  one  of  the
defenders;  since the wall protects its defenders, the spell is stopped.  The
next  round,  passwall is cast on the wall; since it too is a  chosen  spell,
passwall  has  no  effect.  On  the third round,  fireball  is  cast  at  the
defenders, and since it was not named during the casting of spellstopper,  it
has  full  effect; in addition, if dispel magic was cast within one turn,  it
would have a 3% bonus, since fireball is a 3rd-level spell. Nine rounds after
fireball was cast, transmute rock to mud is cast on the wall; it too has full
effect; if dispel magic was cast now, it would have an 8% bonus applied to it
(3%  for the fireball and 5% for rock to mud). Two rounds later, another rock
to  mud  is cast; subsequent dispel attempts now have and 10% bonus  (5%  for
each  rock  to mud; the  for fireball no longer applies, as it has been  more
than 10 rounds since it was cast).
Each casting of spellstopper temporarily reduces the wizard's Constitution by
1d4  points; an hour of undisturbed rest will restore one Constitution  point
lost in this manner. If the wizard's Constitution is reduced to 0 or less  by
casting  this spell, he must make a successful system shock roll  to  prevent
actual death.

The  material components for this spell are a thin sheet of lead, as well  as
the material components for all spells spellstopper will protect against. The
wizard can only protect against spells he can cast himself.

This spell is a version of Mordenkainen's sword, but with a twist. This spell
causes a shimmering aura to form around any sword. This sword will then arise
and  be  at  the  command of the wizard. He may order the  sword  to  attack,
defend, guard, or whatever. The sword can respond to moderately complex tasks
like, "let no one through this door unless they say the word ixitayal".
In combat, the sword will hit any Armour Class on a 19 or 20, it has the same
hit  points as a fighter of the level of the wizard (18/01 Constitution), has
the  same  Armour Class as the wizard, and fights like a fighter of the  same
level (i.e. 2 attacks per round, THAC0 whatever). It attacks as if wielded by
someone  with  an  18/00 Strength (+3,+6). It also has its  own  bonuses;  it
requires a magical sword as material component. If the sword has any  special
abilities these will also be used in the combat.
The  sword  acts  independently of the wizard  (obviously)  and  requires  no
concentration to maintain. However the wizard must remain with  50  yards  of
the sword or it falls to the ground, inert (with magic drained from it). Ways
to  defeat  the sword include: rendering the wizard unconscious, hitting  the
sword  for  loss  of  hit points, encasing it in something,  or  successfully
dispelling it.
As  discussed above, the material component is a magical sword, the magic  of
which is consumed after the spell ends (gives high level wizards a reason  to
collect  all those magic swords and destroy them in the process).  The  other
material component is a gem with the soul of fighter trapped in it. This  gem
becomes embedded in the sword during the spell. Each time the gem is used, it
has  a  cumulative  5% change of shattering, freeing the  poor  soul  inside.
Obviously, the gem is not consumed after the spell ends.

When this spell is cast the individual is empowered with the ability to leap.
The  distance the individual is able to leap is a total of 20 feet per  level
forward,  backward or straight up. A number of jumps up to the level  of  the
wizard  can be made. Also, at the end of the leap, the individual will always
land  without  taking falling damage. Leaps must be completed within  1  turn
plus 1 turn per level after the spell is cast.
An  example: given a 7th-level wizard, the individual affected can jump up to
a  total of 140 feet in up to a total of seven jumps, i.e., seven times a  20
feet jump.

The material components for this spell are the legs of a grasshopper or of  a
frog.

This  spell  allows  the wizard to learn to speak and  understand  a  desired
language known by another creature, or to read and write a language found  in
a  book,  scroll, manuscript, etc. The wizard will only be able to learn  the
language if he has a non-weapon proficiency slot left to spend.
The somatic component is a splayed hand touching the head of the creature  or
the  surface of the written object. There is no saving throw, but because the
hand  must be kept on the subject the entire round of casting, the  spell  is
effective only on a willing (or unconscious, firmly held, etc.) creature.

This  spell determines the magical bonus of weapons and armours (if  any)  or
the  category  of  objects  (such as a girdle of giant  strength)  that  have
different levels of power, as well as the approximate number of chleft in  an
item.
During  the casting, the caster spends time alone with the object,  communing
with the fabric of the magic, trying to attune himself with the magics in the
object.  If he fails an Intelligence check at the end of the hour  the  spell
fails and nothing is discerned, although the materials are still used up.  If
he  succeeds, roll on Table 1 of the Tome of Magic using this number  as  the
level: 14 - the caster's true level. Thus, an 8th-level wild mage would  roll
on  the level-6 line. This result is how much the wizard is off on his guess.
Let's  say  our  wild mage is examining a sword +2, successfully  casts  this
spell and rolls a 4. He will think it is only a sword +1. If he rolled an 11,
he  would  be  right on. If he rolled a 20 he would think it  to  be  a  very
powerful  sword +5. Note that it is possible for him to think it is a  weapon
with a minus, also (he might throw away a sword +3 thinking it a sword -1, if
he  rolled very badly). Note: the DM should do this rolling and tell the wild
mage.  The accuracy of his guesses gets better with higher levels.  Also,  if
the  number  rolled is boldfaced (as for a wild surge) he knows  one  further
thing about it (subject to interpretation by the DM). If it is a sword +1, +4
versus undead, the wild mage could be told it has a secondary bonus versus  a
specific  creature that is 3 greater, that it is a good sword against  undead
(with  no hint as to the bonuses), or something else the DM feels like giving
away,  like  maybe something of its history or previous owners (like  a  bard
knows).  If the item has no additional bonuses, the DM may elect to roll  the
variation  again and give the wild mage the benefit. A wizard  of  thirteenth
level or higher using this spell always uses the level-1 line.
If  cast  to  determine charges, roll twice on the Tome of  Magic,  Table  1.
Multiply  the first roll by 5. Treat negative final results as positive  (you
can't  have  a rod with -12 charges). Note that this spell may only  be  cast
once per day.

The material component is a die worth at least 200 electrum for a weapon, 200
gold  for  armour,  or 200 platinum or a different type of  item  (note  that
special protective items are not armour).

Legolath's weird wildball is identical to a fireball in all respects,  except
that  the elemental type it is based on is different with each casting. Those
creatures  that  are particularly susceptible to the various elemental  types
take  double  damage; normal damage if they make their saving throw  -  those
that are particularly resistant take half damage, none if the saving throw is
successful  (unless  the  monster description  suggests  another  method  for
handling attacks like this). Roll on the following table for elemental  type.
Remember to roll for a wild surge besides any strange effects that may happen
due to this spell.
For the wildball's results, roll on the following table:

     D20 Roll  Wildball Result
     1    Fire.
      2     Magma  (use only half the # of dice, but the magma  sticks:  each
round  it does one less dieof damage until it is at 0) - this is nasty versus
things that don't like fire or heat, taking an extra hit point of damage each
round.
      3     Earth  (-1 to all dice of damage, but it also knocks  the  victim
prone:  must spend next round getting up and re-oriented) - nasty versus  air
elemental creatures.
      4     Ooze  (victim cannot breathe normally the next round, not harmful
but   prevents   spellcasting  that  requires  verbal  components)   -   only
particularly  nasty versus breathing creatures (this is not a  double  damage
case. Like many of the others this will generally only affect creatures  that
breathe but does not do double damage).
      5     Water  (use only half the number of dice, the victim is  drenched
afterwards  if he fails his saving throw: watch those paper items)  -  again,
only  particularly  nasty versus breathing or fire-based  creatures  (imagine
casting  it  at  people in a pit and getting this) - this is a double  damage
case, versus fire.
      6     Ice  (normal damage, but of course the specifics will  differ)  -
nasty versus things that don't like cold.
      7    Air (use only half the number of dice, victim is knocked prone and
must  spend  next  round getting up and re-oriented)  -  nasty  versus  earth
elemental creatures.
      8     Smoke  (no  damage, but it is hard to breathe: -2 to  attack  and
damage,  spells with verbal components have 30% chance to fail  -  the  smoke
stays  in  the  area like a stinking cloud, 1 round per level) -  only  nasty
versus breathing creatures, really.
      9     Radiance (not as hot as fire, it does only 1 point of damage  per
level of the caster - those that save are outlined as by a faerie fire, those
that  do  not  are  blinded  as  by a light spell)  -  nasty  versus  sighted
creatures.
      10    Ash (not as hot as fire, it does only 1 point of damage per level
of  the  caster - same affect as smoke otherwise but only for that round  and
the  next  -  the  ash  falls off) - nasty versus breathing  creatures  (fire
elementals take normal damage as their very fabric is weakened by exposure to
this, 1% chance per 5 levels of the caster that the elemental will be drained
1 HD).
     11   Minerals (normal damage, all metallic weapons and armour are raised
by +1 for 1 turn by the temporary exposure to the pure element).
      12    Dust  (does only 1 point of damage per caster level, all metallic
weapons and armour are drained by -1 for 1 turn by the temporary exposure  to
this  plane, also affects as smoke for the remainder of this round)  -  nasty
versus  breathing  creatures (earth elementals take normal damage,  as  their
very  fabric is weakened by exposure to this, 1% chance per 5 levels  of  the
caster that the elemental will be drained 1 HD).
      13   Steam (-1 to all dice of damage, the victim is drenched afterwards
if  he  fails his saving throw, but in this case the residual heat  makes  it
evaporate quick).
      14    Salt (use only half the number of dice, all liquid items  on  the
victim must save whether he does or not or be dried up) - nasty versus water-
based  and  moist  creatures (especially amphibians) (water  elementals  take
normal damage as their very fabric is weakened by exposure to this, 1% chance
per 5 levels of the caster that the elemental will be drained 1 HD).
     15   Lightning (does normal damage).
      16    Vacuum  (does  half damage) - nasty versus  breathing  creatures,
others still take damage because of the slap when the air rushes back in (air
elementals take normal damage as their very fabric is weakened by exposure to
this, 1% chance per 5 levels of the caster that the elemental will be drained
1 HD).
      17    Positive Energy (heals the amount of damage rolled) - hit  points
can  go to up to twice the maximum (temporary gain, 1 turn, damage comes from
these hit points first), but if the victim exceeds this he explodes.
      18    Negative Energy (does double damage to all but undead,  save  for
only  "normal"  damage) - if victim is slain by this he turns  into  a  free-
willed ju-ju zombie with 3+12 HD.
      19    Roll again ignoring 19's and 20's - the spell effect takes a  10-
foot  radius  (not  20-foot) on victim and caster -  both  suffer  only  half
damage.
      20    Spell  affects random person (if cast on a person) or object  (if
cast  on  an  object) within 50 yards of the caster (roll again to  determine
exactly what kind it is, ignoring 19's and 20's).

The  material component is a wonderstone (a stone of many colours  all  mixed
together, probably sedimentary, and not really all that wonderful).

With  this  Devotion, the Psionicist is able to defend a contacted
mind  against  intrusion from another Psionicist. Any  attempt  to
contact this mind fails and a Psychic Combat must be fought.   The
Defense  can  be established with this Devotion in  the  contacted
mind;  using  the  Psionicist's  Score  -2.  While  defending  his
friend's  mind, the Psionicist sacrifices his own defense  in  the
first place, but he may activate one other power in the same round
(because one of the powers is a defense). It's not possible to use
this  DevAND establish a defense in the friend's mind in the  same
round.  The other power may be a defense for the Psionicist's  own
mind,  an  attack, or any other power he is able to  use.  If  the
Psionicist does not defend himself mentally, nevertheless he has a
closed mind, so he cannot be contacted without combat.  Then,  any
successful attack versus his mind establishes one tangent.

Power  Score:  The contacted mind gains the benefits of a 'Thought
Shield'.

20:  The Psionicist is not able to use any defense for 1 turn.

field  of  any  desired  colour around his person. Up to  7  other  man-sized
creatures can fit into the field with its creator, and these can freely  pass
into  and  out  of  the brothel without harming it, but  if  the  spellcaster
removes himself from it, the spell dissipate.
The temperature inside the hut is a cool 60 F, if the exterior temperature is
between  0  F  and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 F and above  100  F
lowers  or raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1-for-1 basis.
The tiny brothel also provides protection against the elements, such as rain,
dust,  sandstorms, and the like. The hut can withstand any wind of less  than
hurricane  force  without  being harmed, but wind  force  greater  than  that
destroys it.
The  interior  of the hut is a hemisphere; the spellcaster can illuminate  it
dimly upon command, or extinguish the light as desired. The floor of the  hut
is  soft  and  springy. Nice big cushy pillows are also in the  brothel.  The
spellcaster can cause the brothel play soft romantic music upon command. Note
that  although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is  transparent
from  within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through  the
hut  without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside
the hut. The hut can be dispelled.

The  material component for this spell is a small crystal bead that  shatters
when  the spell duration expires or the brothel is dispelled, the hair  of  a
prostitute, and a feather (duck feathers work best).

A  spell  similar to Leomund's tiny hut, this spell was probably not made  by
Leomund.  Speculation gives credit to one of Leomund's  apprentices.  In  any
case,  this  is  a  weaker  spell but with extra  niceties.  Another  strange
relative to this spell is its sister spell Leomund's tiny brothel (definitely
not from Leomund, thus adding evidence to the originals of these copies).
When  this  spell is cast, the wizard creates an unmoving, opaque, soundproof
sphere  of  force  of any desired colour around his person.  Up  to  6  other
mansized  creatures  can fit into the field with its creator,  and  they  can
freely pass into and out of the tavern without harming it. If the spellcaster
removes himself from it, the spell dissipates.
The temperature inside the tavern is a cool 60 F, if the exterior temperature
is  between 0 F and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 F and above 100  F
respectively lowers or raises, the interior temperature on a 1  for 1  basis.
The  tiny tavern also provides protection against the elements, such as rain,
dust,  sandstorms, and the like. The tavern can withstand any  wind  of  less
than  hurricane force without being harmed, but wind forces greater than that
destroy it.
The interior of the tavern is a hemisphere; the spellcaster can illuminate it
dimly upon command, or extinguish the light as desired. A sturdy wooden table
and  seven  chairs sit in the centre of the tavern. On the  table  are  three
bowls.  One  contains pretzels, one contains potato chips, and  one  contains
peanuts.  The bowls magically fill themselves with the snacks. Alongside  the
table  is  a  chest filled with a neverending supply of ice  and  bottles  of
alcohol.  The type of alcohol is dependent of the 's wishes. Each bottle  may
contain a different type of alcohol but no alcohol may be better than  normal
in  quality.  An  illusion  of a lovely, big-breasted,  blonde  wench  and  a
handsome  young gigolo will mingle around the tavern and serve the occupants'
needs.
Note  that  although  the  force field is opaque  from  the  outside,  it  is
transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects will  pass
through  the  tavern  without affecting it and its  occupants,  although  the
occupants  cannot  be  seen  from  outside the  tavern.  The  tavern  can  be
dispelled.

The  material component for this spell is a small crystal bead that  shatters
when  the spell duration expires or the tavern is dispelled, a glass  bottle,
and an oak stick (at least one foot long).

This spell allows the caster to create a stationary wall composed of material
from  his  elemental plane of worship (templars may cast this  spell  in  any
form).  It  covers  a  20-foot-square area per level  (the  thickness  varies
depending on the element); this area may be arranged in any manner to form  a
rectangular  wall, as long as neither dimension falls below 5 feet.  As  with
minor elemental wall, lesser elemental wall covers a 20-foot-square area  per
level  (the  thickness varies depending on the element);  this  area  may  be
arranged  in  any  manner  to form a rectangular wall,  as  long  as  neither
dimension  falls  below  5  feet.  While this  set  of  spells  share  common
characteristics,  such as duration and area of effect,  the  wall's  specific
properties differ based on its composition.

     Element   Properties
      Air   Creates a deafening wall of violently disturbed air that  is  two
feet  thick.  Treat as per wall of sound (see the Complete  Bard's  Handbook,
page 78). Namely, one side chosen by the caster produces such a roar that all
communication  (including verbal spell components)  is  disrupted  within  30
feet.  Those within 10 feet are deafened for 1d4 turns if they fail  to  save
versus  spell.  The sound is heard on the other side, but is not  disruptive.
Anyone  passing  through  the  wall suffers  1d8  points  of  damage  and  is
permanently deafened unless he rolls a successful saving throw versus  spell.
Deafened  creatures  suffer  1 penalty to surprise rolls,  a  +1  penalty  to
initiative  rolls, and they are 20% likely to miscast spells  with  a  verbal
component.  A  silence, 15-foot radius spell cast by a  higher  level  caster
specifically  for  this  purpose will dispel the  wall;  the  wall  otherwise
destroys all silence spells that come into contact with it.
      Water     Creates a wall of "solid fog" that is up to 10 feet thick per
level of the caster. Treat as a solid fog (page 163, Player's Handbook).
      Fire Creates a billowing wall of black smoke that is 10 feet thick. Due
to  its  noxious  gasses, treat it as a stinking cloud  (page  145,  Player's
Handbook),  except those exposed to the cloud save with  a   3  penalty.  All
vision within and through the wall is impossible.
      Earth      Creates a wall of swirling dust that is 10 feet thick.  This
wall  has two effects. Treat as a blur for all attacks made within or through
the  wall (eg., ranged attacks; page 140, Player's Handbook). Anybody  coming
into  physical contact with the wall will suffer as per the "itching" version
of  irritation  (page 142, Player's Handbook)   saving throws  are  at  a   3
penalty regardless of the number of creatures entering the area of effect.

The  material component is a bit of the element (air, water, fire, earth)  of
which the wall is composed.

      This  spell causes an object to vanish from sight, much like  the  2nd-
level  wizard  spell invisibility (which affects only creatures).  The  spell
lasts  only 2 rounds per level of the wizard or until the wizard wills it  to
end.  For  example, a quiver of arrows or a bow could be made  invisible  and
carried,  and  when desired, a moment's thought could make them appear.  Note
that not even the wizard can see the invisible object, so if he is to use  it
most effectively, it may be necessary to make it visible.

This  spell creates one clone, plus one for every five levels of the  wizard,
of the wizard. Each clone has hit points equal to the wizard's level, and all
physical (non-spell) abilities of the wizard. The clones are completely loyal
to  the wizard (as their minds overlap in a way, with his own) and can  carry
out reasonably complex tasks (DM discretion). The clones are created wreathed
in  simple illusions which mimic the wizard's possessions, though they  serve
no  other purpose, and can be discarded at the clone's will (as the clone may
have  real clothes or the like available). Due to the mental overlap  of  the
clones  with  the wizard, while any are within 100 meters of the wizard,  the
following is possible:
          The wizard can communicate telepathically with the clones.
           The  wizard will sense where the clones are, regardless  of  sight
etc.
           The  wizard can cast memorised spells through a clone - the spells
are  cast  normally, with the wizard himself performing all actions necessary
to  the  casting (the clone can mimic these if desired), the only  difference
being  the  spell's point of origin, which is a clone (all effects  use  that
clone as the caster).
           The  wizard can map a clone's senses onto his own, but when  doing
so,  the  wizard's sense that is being mapped over is not available (eg.:  if
the wizard maps a clone's sight over his own for five minutes, then he cannot
see through his own eyes for those five minutes).

The  material components are a number of pearls (each worth at least 500  gp)
equal to the number of clones to be created (the number of clones created  is
equal  to the number of pearls used, with an upper limit of one plus one  for
every five levels of the wizard), and a drop of the wizard's blood upon  each
pearl. At the completion of the spell, the bloodied pearls are flung from the
wizard, and where each lands, a clone forms out of it.

This  spell creates a clone of the wizard. The clone has hit points equal  to
the  wizard's level (eg.: 14 HP for a clone of a 14th-level wizard), and  all
physical (non-spell) abilities of the wizard. The clone's mind overlaps  with
the wizard's, though the clone's is by no means complete. The clone can carry
out  reasonably  complex  tasks  (DM's discretion),  and  is  essentially  an
extension of the wizard.
The  clone  is created wreathed in simple illusions which mimic the  wizard's
possessions, though they serve no other purpose, and can be discarded at  the
clone's will (as the clone may have real clothes or the like available).  The
clone  itself is a magical construct, and is detectable as such in the normal
ways  (eg., detect magic or true seeing will reveal its true nature). Due  to
the  mental  overlap of the clone's mind with the wizard's, while within  100
meters of the wizard, the clone has the following properties:
           The wizard will sense where the clone is, regardless of sight  and
the like (similar to the sense of where one's arm is).
           The wizard can communicate telepathically with the clone (silently
and accurately convey concepts, as if talking to oneself).
           The  wizard can cast memorised spells through the clone. The spell
is  cast  normally, with the wizard performing all actions necessary for  the
casting  (the clone will reflexively mimic the non-material components),  the
only  difference being the spell's point of origin, which is the  clone:  all
effects,  not  including side effects, use the clone  as  the  wizard  ("side
effects" include such things as the ageing caused by certain spells).
           The wizard can, at will, swap the clone's senses with his own. For
example,  the  wizard  can swap sight with the clone,  and  see  through  the
clone's  eyes (and the clone would see through the wizard's). The wizard  can
of course swap back to his normal sight at will.

The  material components consist of a representation of the wizard (a  carved
figure or a clay model, for example) coated with the dust of a crushed  pearl
(made of a perfectly round pearl, worth at least 1000 gp), and a drop of  the
wizard's blood. When the spell is cast, the figurine is placed where it is to
appear,  and it transforms into the clone (when the clone disappears  at  the
end of spell duration, the figurine is gone).
Optional  extension: the spell has a (25 - wizard's level)%  chance  (with  a
minimum  of  1%) of creating a sentient clone, i.e.: the clone is  under  the
control of the DM. The clone is in all other ways the same as a normal clone,
though  should  the  wizard die, the clone will gain full  abilities  of  the
wizard. Sentient clones have the same personality and memories as the  wizard
(and  thus  know  the spell effects, the fact that they will  expire,  etc.).
Basically, a DM can enjoy some interesting roleplaying here.

The  material  component  of this spell is a large  crystal  (for  example  a
diamond),  worth at least 1000 gp, mounted in a precious metal  (platinum  or
better)  on  a handle constructed from a precious wood (ebony, for  example).
This construction is not consumed in the casting.
At  the  completion of the casting, the crystal starts glowing  from  within.
When  the  material component is wielded, the wielder can  summon  the  blade
forth at will (if the wielder is not the wizard, or is not familiar with  the
spell, the wizard will have to explain how to do this; it takes approximately
1 turn to understand how to control the summoning of the blade, and the blade
will  be active for 2d6 rounds in the process), and a blade of 5 feet  length
will spring from the crystal.
This  blade  is  primarily light, contained within a field of magical  force,
though  this force is such that the blade can block another blade,  including
non-liteblades. The blade itself has no discernible weight, and thus is  very
fast,  having weapon speed 1 and +3 to-hit (also determining what  the  blade
can  effect).  By the same token, it is balanced differently than  any  other
weapon,  and  unless the wielder has spent considerable time  practising  the
liteblade, the wielder will suffer the normal weapon non-proficiency penalty.
In game terms, this means the character has to be proficient in the liteblade
(note this requires rather considerable access to liteblades).
The blade does 1d10 damage on a successful hit (this damage is primarily from
light  and heat, and creatures particularly resistant or vulnerable  to  such
damage  will take half and double damage respectively, and those immune  will
take  none).  Also note that the blade cauterises the wounds it creates,  and
thus no bleeding will result.
Optional extension: on a roll of a natural 19, the opponents weapon must save
versus  magical fire or be cut by the blade (if reasonable). On a roll  of  a
natural 20, roll a 1d20 on the following table:

     D20 Roll  Effect
     1    Head severed
     2-5  Arm severed
     6-10 Hand severed
     11-15     Leg severed
     16-20     Normal damage

The  blade  will retreat to a state of inactivity within the crystal  at  the
wielder's will, or if the material component is released.

When  a wizard casts this spell, a black bolt of negative plane energy shoots
out to strike one creature within range. The creature struck must save versus
death  magic or lose one level of experience, as if touched by a  wight.  The
various  protections  against  negative plane  energy  are  also  useful  for

This  power  is  identical to levitation, except  it  is  used  to
levitate  other  characters. The psionicist can  optionally  stays
where he is, while someone else is levitated. The creature must be
willing  to  be levitated, or unconscious. If an willing  creature
start  to  frantically move while in the air (in combat, panic  or
don't  want  to  be  levitated anymore) the psionicist  must  make
another  power check for each round to maintain the  character  in
the air.
      A  psionicist levitate creatures with weights similar to his
own.   Additional weight, however, such as equipment,  passengers,
or  large  creatures  are a hindrance. Every 25  pounds  of  added
weight  reduces  the  character's power score  by  one  point  and
increase initial and the maintenance cost by 4 points.
      The  DM  can  impose a power score penalty to  try  to  stop
falling creatures.

Power  Score:  The initial cost is reduced to 12 per creature  and
the maintenance if halved.

20:  The psionicist doubles the weight of all creatures one round.
If they fall, they suffer an extra 1d6 points of damage.

      When  this  spell is cast, the wizard is able to bind the wounds  of  a
creature up to 5 yards away plus 5 yard per level. This spell is to  be  used
together with the optional "hovering on death's door" rule on page 75 of  the
Dungeon Master's Guide.

      The  bindings are only able to tend to someone's bleeding wounds.  They
have  no  power to hinder a creature's movement. The creature  on  which  the
bindings are used immediately stops bleeding from serious wounds but does not
recover any hit points. Hit points must be recovered normally.

     This spell is very useful if nobody of the party can reach the character
who  just reached 0 or less hit points. Lhaeo (no, not the Lhaeo) often meets
this  problem because he travels with a bunch of suicidal maniacs who  always
manage  to get themselves below 0 HP and this always happens when that person
is as far away from the party as possible.

The  material  component of this spell is a piece of bandage  which  must  be
thrown  toward the injured creature. While the piece of bandage flies  toward
the  target it grows and grows until it reaches the exact size needed to stop
the  wound from bleeding. Then the bandage wraps itself around the wound  and
stays there until someone removes it. The wizard does not need to concentrate
on this spell.

When this spell is cast, the wizard saves versus death magic. If he fails, he
becomes a lich, otherwise he dies. Should he be raised or resurrected, he can
try  again. This spell makes clear why a wizard has to be of eighteenth level
to be able to become a lich.

This spell allows the wizard to steal 2d6 years from a victim and add them to
his  own  life. The victim must be human and of a level equal to  or  greater
than that of the wizard. If the victim is of lower level, the number of years
transferred  is  multiplied  by  the  victim's  level  and  divided  by   the
necromancer's. Since the victim must be in the centre of a pentagram  at  the
completion  of  the casting, it is useful to have him held or immobilised  in
some  way.  The  reverse spell, give life, works in the same fashion,  except
that  the wizard ages 2d6 years while the recipient becomes younger, and  the
recipient  must  be willing. In either case, the material  components  are  a
black  candle,  a  white candle, a drop of blood from  both  parties,  and  a
specially prepared glass screen.

By  use  of this spell, the preserver drains the life force of plants in  the
area  of  effect  to  one third of their full life force. Thus,  plants  will
weaken, but they will regain their strength in a relatively short time.  This
energy  is then stored in the preserver that has cast the spell, and  can  be
used to revitalize a section of defiled soil of an area one ninth the size of
the  area  of effect. The energy can be stored for 3 turns plus one turn  per
level of the wizard, during which period he cannot cast any other spells.

The material component for this spell is a drop of water. This spell can - of
course - only be cast by a preserver.

Through  the use of this spell, the priest is pitting his life force  against
that  of  the  target  creature. This is the pure confrontation  of  the  two
beings' wills to live. Both combatants roll 1d20, adding the result to  their
current  hit points. This can be modified by bless, chant, prayer, a ring  or
cloak of protection, a luckstone, a luck sword, wisdom bonuses, etc.
If  the  target  creature's total is less than half the priest's  total,  the
target  creature  is overwhelmed and dies (in this case, the  priest  suffers
fatigue  equal  to  half  the target's roll in hit  points).  If  the  target
creature's  total  is less than the priest's total but  more  than  half  the
priest's  total,  the target is stunned for 2d4 rounds ( 5 to  Armour  Class,
initiative,  saving throws, to-hit and damage rolls), and the priest  suffers
fatigue equal to the difference in hit points. If the target's total is  more
than  the  priest's,  the priest dies and the target suffers  fatigue  damage
equal to the difference in hit points. Fatigue is recovered at a rate of 1 HP
per  round.  The  material components for this spell are  the  priest's  holy
symbol, a pair of ivory six-sided dice (worth at least 200 gp) and a drop  of
the priest's blood.

This  spell  is  a  variation of the 1st-level wizard  spell  unseen  servant
(q.v.).  The  servant created by this spell is visible as a  vaguely  manlike
form  of glowing light, and is slightly stronger, being able to lift 3000  gp
weight  and taking 8 points of magical damage to destroy. The light  provided
by  the  servant is enough to allow normal vision in a 10-yard radius  around
the  servant. Except as noted above, and that the material components of this
spell  are a live firefly and a piece of thread, this spell behaves as unseen
servant.

This  spell causes a link to aspecified plane to spring up. This link  allows
the  caster full access to the energies of that plane. This spell even causes
the  link to extend into the phlogiston. Thus, it would be possible to access
the  astral, ethereal, the elemental, or the outer planes with this spell  if
the  spell  caster of these additional spells are within the area  of  effect
(caution:  do  not  conjure a fire elemental into the phlogiston:  it  causes
quite  big explosions). It is possible to also access such items as  portable
holes,  bags  of holding, etc. in the phlogiston or on other planes  if  this
spell  is in effect. The casting time states that it takes a casting time  of
one month per crystal sphere and plane linked. This means that the shells and
planes to be linked have to be named (and see components below) individually.
Thus,  if  one  shell is to be linked with ten planes, it  takes  ten  months
casting  time, ten shells with ten planes takes one hundred months, etc.  The
effect  causes only the sphere around the caster to be able to  access  those
planes.  If  a summoned or conjured creature that cannot normally  enter  the
plane  or  the  phlogiston leaves the shell they have to make a saving  throw
versus death magic each round or be sent back immediately to their respective
planes.  Anything not completely inside the shell is considered to be outside
the  shell  and all effects that happen at this time are witnessed  upon  the
creature or object.

The material component is the distilled liquefied essence of the plane to  be
accessed  (astral  luminaries, ethereal radiance, liquefied  elemental  fire,
etc.). In addition, one magic item per shell has to be destroyed for the link
to  be  brought about. This item has to be completely immersed into a diamond
cylinder  which is made from a single diamond. Then the liquefied essence  of
the  planes has to be added and the cylinder has to be plugged with a stopper
made from a carved king's tear.

This is a modified form of polymorph self in that it allows wizards to change
their  form. They can still use ordinary melee weapons (swords, maces,  axes,
etc.).  They get a +1 to hit and cannot be disarmed. Non-magical  weapons  do
superficial damage: it is automatically healed. The healing rate is 1d12  per
round,  and  takes most of the casters effort (he can move normally,  but  no
spell  casting or attacking is possible; he can use magical items that use  a
command word only if his throat and mouth are not damaged).
Magical  weapons and spells do normal damage, except for cold based  attacks,
which slow the caster as a slow spell. Any physical attacks during this  time
do  double  damage. Multiple cold spells continue to slow  the  caster.  Heat
spells  do  normal damage. Electrical attacks do no damage. Acid  attacks  do
double damage. If the caster is reduced to 0 HP or below (down to -10) by non-
magical  attacks,  the caster's form falls apart. It takes  the  caster  2d10
rounds  to reform and collect all his parts. Other abilities while in  liquid
form allow the caster to pass through grates, bars, or small openings at half
his  normal  movement. All items carried by the caster are converted  to  the
liquid  form. Magical properties perpetuate into the new form: if the  caster
is  carrying a dagger, +1, and a magical blade forms from a hand,  then  that
blade  would have a magical property of +1 as well, but only on a  one-to-one
basis  (if a caster had one dagger, +1, and he created two hand blades,  only
one  could be +1). Other items, such as a wand of lightning bolts, could also
be used in this form.

This spell is a modified version of shapechange, except that it is limited to
dragon-like  forms  only. The dragon-forms created  by  this  spell  will  be
perfect  in  all details, undetectable by other dragons, who will of  course,
depending  on  their  alignment,  either greet  or  attack  the  caster.  All
attributes of the dragon are as listed in the Monster Compendium,  volume  1,
except   for   Intelligence,  Wisdom,  and  alignment.  This   spell   allows
transformation into any age area except great wyrm. This spell was devised by
a  dragon  named Lizward for his elf companion Ditan, may thousands of  years
ago  and has only recently been allowed to be distributed in the Tower of the
Realms.

This  spell is equivalent to the 5th-level wizard spell wall of force  (q.v.)
in  all  respects save one: the wizard is able to manipulate the force  wall.
The following variations are possible:
Version 1: the wizard can cast the wall in a hemispherical or spherical shape
around  himself with himself as the centre point. The wizard  can  then  move
about and the wall will move with him. This version is tinted red.
Version  2:  the wizard can cast the spell as a wall (2-dimensional  barrier)
and  then  move in a direction with the wall moving 1 to 3 yards in front  of
him.  The  wall will always be in front of the wizard, and will  turn  as  he
turns.  This  version is tinted blue. Note that this version cannot  be  cast
horizontally.

The  material components for version one are a pinch of diamond  dust  and  a
pinch  of  ruby dust. The material components for version two are a pinch  of
diamond dust and a pinch of sapphire dust.

By   means  of  the  Lloyd's  beacon  spell,  the  spellcaster  is  able   to
instantaneously  return  to  a  previously prepared  location.  The  material
component  of  the  spell  is  a  gem of not less  than  500  gp  value.  The
spellcaster casts Lloyd's beacon at the place which he wishes to set  as  the
return  location. This setting of the location takes one turn. After  setting
the  location, the gem disappears and the area radiates alteration magic.  At
anytime  afterwards, the spell caster can cast the recall version of  Lloyd's
beacon,  with  a  casting  time of 1, requiring only verbal  components.  The
spellcaster, along with anything he is touching up to 150 pounds + 50  pounds
per  level above seventh are instantly teleported to the preset location with
no  chance  of error. Unwilling travellers require a successful to-hit  roll,
and in addition get a saving throw versus spell, with success indicating that
they  were  not  teleported.  The  location  remains  set  until  either  the
spellcaster decides to change it or until it is dispelled by someone else. If
it  is dispelled, the recall version will fail, but the wizard will not  know
this  until  after  he  casts the spell, unless he uses  some  other  magical
divination (eg., contact other plane). When the set location is dispelled  or
removed  by  the wizard, the gem reappears and may be reused. The wizard  may
only have one Lloyd's beacon set at any one time.

The  caster  can  use  this  spell to locate  particular  emanations  of  the
elements.
           The  air priest can try to locate a specific gas or vapour or  the
existence of air at a given place.
          The earth priest can find metals, minerals, gems, etc.
          Fire priests can detect the temperature of a given place or whether
the  element  of  fire had touched the place in the recent past  (1  day  per
level).
           Water  priests can locate bodies of water or other liquids in  the
area of effect.
In all cases, the area of effect is a circular area with a radius of 50 yards
per  experience level of the caster. He learns the answer at the end  of  the
casting. The spell cannot be fooled by illusions or other spells of less than
sixth level.
The  material  component is some of the material sought (a gas  container,  a
flask of water, a gem or piece of iron or a burning stick for example).  This
spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary units  are
for the Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

This  spell causes two unrelated effects. The first is a local tremor of  low
strength  that  rumbles  the ground in a 25-foot  diameter  area  around  the
caster.  The  shock lasts for the duration of the spell. The small  quake  is
dramatic  and  startling but does not cause any harm or ill  effects.  It  is
intended to mislead victims into thinking the spell affects multiple  persons
or a large area like the earthquake spell.
The  real danger of the spell is the second effect, that is directed  towards
only  one  creature within 25 feet. The target of the spell shakes  violently
for  the  duration of the spell (note that this effect is a  separate  action
from  the  quake). The shaking renders the victim immobile (no  movement,  no
combat,  etc.). If a person or creature touches the trembling victim  at  any
time,  then  that  person begins to shake as well for the  remainder  of  the
spell. A trembling person suffers 1d4 points of damage per round. During  the
last  round, a trembling person must make a saving throw. Failing the  saving
throw  causes  the  person to enter comatose state of  intoxication  for  1d6
hours. Recovery from this state is as stated in the rules.
The  main  material component of this spell is a pint of a martini,  a  drink
composed of gin (an alcoholic liquor distilled from grain and flavoured  with
juniper  berries), vodka (an alcoholic liquid distilled from fermented  wheat
or  rye  mash,  corn, or potatoes), and dry vermouth (a white wine  flavoured
with aromatic herbs). Other material components are one olive with a slice of
pimento (a mild-flavoured red pepper) in it, and the tail feather from a male
chicken (a cocktail). All material components are consumed once the spell  is
cast.

The  great  magic of healing is not limited to those medic priests that  roam
with  adventuring  parties. Lohocla bestows the art  of  healing  to  wizards
through this spell.
Known  to  some as the water of life, this spell's healing powers begin  once
the wizard anoints the injured person with alcohol. The alcohol may be of any
type  (beer,  wine,  liquor, etc.) but must be a minimum  of  100  years  old
(created  at  least  a century ago). When anointing the injured  person,  the
wizard must have physical contact with the victim (touch him).
After the spell is cast, it causes 1d8 + 1 per level points of damage to  the
creature's  body  to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures  without
corporeal  bodies,  nor  can it cure wounds of creatures  not  living  or  of
extraplanar  origin. Curing is permanent only in so far as the creature  does
not  sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just
as any normal injury.
This  spell, along with permanency and a few other enchantments, can be  used
to  make a healing potion. Unlike the priest's healing potions, this wizard's
potion has the taste and effects of wine. An exciting concept indeed.

Another  powerful offensive spell by Lohocla, this spell creates  a  vaporous
cloud of pure alcohol. Hopefully, many wizards will enjoy reeking havoc  with
the sweet aroma of this spell.
This spell produces a cloud of alcohol that has a very faint blue tint to it.
The  cloud gives off a strong scent of alcohol. The cloud will move away from
the  caster  at 10 feet per round, rolling along the ground in  the  original
direction dictated by the caster. A moderate breeze causes it to alter course
(roll  for direction), but it does not move back toward the caster. A  strong
wind  breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the  use
of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. As
the  vapours are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land,
even pour downden or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor  can
it be cast underwater.
For  each  round  a  creature  is engulfed in  the  cloud,  he  must  make  a
Constitution check. The check has a modifier relevant to the wizard's level:

     Wizard's Level Constitution Modifier
     7-8  -4
     9-10 -5
     11-12     -6
     13-14     -7
     15-16     -8
     17-18     -9
     19-20     -10

A  successful  check indicates that the creature holds his  breath  for  that
round  and  does not succumb to the cloud's effects. A failed check indicates
that  the creature inhales a sufficient quantity of the gaseous vapours  into
the  lungs.  The effects of absorbing gaseous alcohol through the respiratory
system  rather  than  liquid alcohol through the digestive  system  is  quite
dangerous.  A  person  affected  by  the  cloud  enters  a  state  of   great
intoxication with all the effects that this entails. The affected person will
remain intoxicated for 1d30 rounds after the duration of the spell. Once  the
intoxication ends, the victim will be returned to a normal state (he does not
have to slowly recover from the intoxication). The only possible reminder  of
the  intoxication  would be a hangover (see the Net Alcohol  Guide  for  more
information) if a saving throw versus poison is failed.
If  the cloud of alcohol comes in contact with a flame, it explodes. Anything
in  the  cloud will suffer 2d10+10 points of burn damage. The explosion  will
reach  out  a  number  of feet equal to five times half the  wizard's  level.
Anything that is in the explosion area of effect will suffer 1d10+5 points of
burn  damage. For example, a 10th-level wizard casts the spell and creates  a
50-foot  cubic cloud that comes in contact with a candle flame.  Anything  in
the  cloud will take 2d10+10 points of burn damage. The explosion will  reach
anything that is 25 feet away from the cloud which will suffer 1d10+5  points
of burn damage. Unfortunately, the wizard was within 10 feet of the cloud and
suffers 8 points of damage. With regards to the fiery explosion, please  note
that  flammable  materials will continue to burn after  the  explosion  takes
place.
At  tenth level, a wizard has the option of igniting the cloud. If the wizard
opts  to  do  this, casting time is 6 rounds. Upon completion of casting  the
spell,  the cloud will travel its course until the last round of the  spell's
duration.  At  this  point, the cloud is ignited and  explodes  as  described
above.
At  the  very  low  temperature of -170 F, the cloud of alcohol  will  freeze
solid.  There will be few times that the wizard would find himself in such  a
situation.  However,  the wizard may find himself in a  situation  where  the
temperature drops to below 0 F. In this case, the cloud of alcohol will begin
to  turn into liquid form. The spell is rendered virtually useless as far  as
its combative intent goes. However, the cold liquid form of alcohol may serve
a  more important purpose. A lot of pure, smooth alcohol can be produced  for
consumption.  This  spell which seems to be nothing more  than  an  offensive
weapon could perhaps enable alcohol production in places where grain can't be
grown or where fermentation is difficult due to weather or temperature. Thus,
DMs  may want to introduce this spell in an Arctic climate as a creative  way
of  producing alcohol. Then, a character may or may not learn of the  spell's
full offensive potential.
Note  that the cloud of alcohol disperse once the duration of the spell ends.
However,  any  liquid or solid forms of the alcohol will  permanently  remain
after the spell ends.
The  main material component is a finely-crafted glass snifter (a pear-shaped
goblet  with  a  narrow  top) which remains after the spell  is  cast.  Other
material components, which are consumed when the spell is cast, are a pint of
pure  alcohol and a small ice cube. A wizard using the ignition  option  must
have a pinch of dung from a milwaukee.

      Lohocla didn't want priests to be the only spell casters able to create
food.  Unfortunately, the results might not be as nourishing  as  a  priest's
food and water. However, Lohocla's beer and pretzels have their benefits.

      When this spell is cast, the wizard causes beer and pretzels to appear.
For every level of the wizard, a quart of beer is created and a half pound of
pretzels. The pretzels come in a wide variety of sizes and types. The beer is
of excellent quality and quite filling.

      The  beer  becomes  flat and the pretzels become  stale  in  24  hours,
although they can be restored for another 24 hours by a purify spell of  some
sort.

The material components of the spell are a pinch of salt and a pinch of hops.

      This  spell  was  created by Lohocla or at least commissioned  by  him.
Lohocla wanted to give a gift back to those wizards who have supported him in
the  past. This spell is bizarre in that a person must be intoxicated to  use
it.  Lohocla has a unique concept of magic and the best way to wield it. Yet,
this  may be a benefit because this eccentric spell allows the wizard to cast
at  low-level,  a powerful and damaging (possibly dangerous) rockets  at  its
opponents even though his current ability is poor because the intoxication.

The  material components of this spell are a bottle of alcohol (any type) and
a 1-foot long smooth stick that can fit into the bottle with one end sticking
out.

      An unusual spell indeed, this spell cannot be cast unless the caster is
under the influence of alcohol (i.e. in a state of slight, moderate, or great
intoxication).  Of course, the wizard generally doesn't go adventuring  while
drunk, so this becomes a big hindrance if not useless. On the other h it  can
be  a real benefit when the wizard goes to a place knowing full well that  he
will  become intoxicated. Mainly, because there is no chance of spell failure
for  this spell (note that the chance of spell failure is still there for all
other  spells).  This  becomes  very valuable  because  the  wizard  can  get
intoxicated,  with all the problems it entails, and always have  a  memorised
spell that will work (especially when greatly intoxicated when the chance  of
spell failure is 100%).

     When the wizard casts the spell, he must take a swig of alcohol from the
bottle, place the stick in the bottle, and then aim the bottle at its  target
which all takes place while saying the magical words.

      Once the spell is cast, 2 sparkling rockets of magical energy per level
fly  out of the bottle with a ear piercing whistle to unerringly strike their
targets  with a dazzling display of colours (see below). This includes  enemy
creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen must be seen otherwise
detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that  offered
by  arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster  must
be  able  to  identify the target. He cannot direct a rocket to  "strike  the
captain of the guard", unless he can single out the captain from the rest  of
the  soldiers. Specific parts of a creature be singled out. Inanimate objects
(locks and the like) cannot be damaged by the spell, and the rockets disperse
with no effect.

      Very fascinating, the damage a rocket does is dependent on the state of
intoxication  the  wizard is in. If in a state of slight  intoxication,  each
rocket   will  do  1d4+1  points  of  damage.  If  in  a  state  of  moderate
intoxication, each rocket will do 1d8+1 points of damage. If in  a  state  of
great  intoxication, each rocket will do 1d12+1 points  of  damage.  This  is
possibly  the  only instance where being more intoxicated  is  a  benefit  in
combat.

      When  a  rocket  hits a target, a spray (5x10x10 foot wedge)  of  vivid
multiple  colours  spring  forth from the impact spot.  Usually,  the  colour
splash is harmless but dazzling. There is a 1% chance per level of the caster
that  the  colour  slash will be harmful. If harmful, then from  one  to  six
creatures (1d6) within the area are affected in order of increasing  distance
from the target. All creatures above the level of the wizard and all those of
sixth  level  or  6  Hit Dice or more are entitled to a saving  throw  versus
spell.  Blind or unseeing creatures are not affected by the spell.  Creatures
not  allowed or failing saving throws, and whose Hit Dice or levels are  less
than  or  equal to the wizard's level, are struck unconscious for 2d4 rounds;
those  with  Hit  Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than the wizard's  level  are
blinded for 1d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or more greater  than
that  of  the  wizard  are  stunned (reeling  and  unable  to  think  or  act
coherently) for one round.

Another  of  Lohocla's gifts to strange wizards this is the low-level  sister
spell  to  Lohocla's  tipsy  turvey teleport.  Although  it  may  seem  quite
powerful,  it  is  not.  The consequences of casting  this  spell  are  quite
dangerous,  which will be mentioned later. Many 1st-level spells would  be  a
much  better  pick,  but some half-crazed wizards add  this  spell  to  their
collection for a little random spontaneity.
When  this spell is used, the wizard is able to teleport a maximum weight  of
250  pounds,  plus  additional 150 pounds for each level of experience  above
tenth  (a  13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 pounds),  to  a  randomly
selected  place. The place must have an alcohol theme (inns,  taverns,  bars,
wineries, breweries, distilleries, vineyards, etc.) and be a location visited
by  the wizard after receiving the spell. Thus, a wizard who just copied  the
spell into his spell book would have a non-functioning spell until he visited
an  alcohol  related  location. The player should make a  table  of  all  the
locations  and  once the spell is cast, roll on the table to  see  where  the
teleportees  go  to. The DM may opt to make the locations  on  the  table  be
weighted thus making the more frequently visited places become the target  of
the  spell  more  often.  The  spell functions by  scanning  the  character's
subconscious for those places in memory where alcohol or alcohol themes  were
present.
Every  living being or magic item gets a saving throw, if desired  (a  person
who  wants himself and his belongings teleported doesn't need making a saving
throw).  If  the saving throw is successful, the wizard and any comrades  and
friends  (the  spell scans the wizard's mind to see who should accompany  the
spell)  are  teleported instead as long as everybody's weight  is  under  the
maximum  weight  able  to  be teleported. It is the DM's  decision  who  gets
teleported  with the wizard if everybody can't be teleported because  of  the
weight restriction.
Because  the spell's effects can be reversed and the spell uses the  wizard's
memories,  it  can  be very dangerous for the wizard if he  uses  it  against
enemies.  Mainly, the spell sends the enemies to the establishments that  the
wizard  visited  and if the wizard ever returns to these places,  the  people
there  will probably be quite upset. The best use of the spell is to cast  it
on  oneself  and  your comrades so you will be teleported to the  places.  Of
course,  if there are hostile places that you can be teleported to, then  you
could  be in an even worse situation. Also, not too many adventuring  parties
will  want  to chance leaving in the middle of an adventure because  of  this
spell.
Unlike  its  sister  spell,  Lohocla's  tipsy  turvey  teleport,  this  spell
permanently teleports the teleportees to the location.

      Lohocla  created this spell for a tavern owner, who happened  to  be  a
retired adventurer wizard, that was having business trouble. Lohocla gave him
100 gold pieces, bestowed the bartending nonweapon proficiency on him, taught
him an abundance of alcohol drinks, gave him the spell, and cast a permanency
spell on an enchanted bartender to serve the wizard as a main bartender.  The
spell is not one normally studied by adventuring wizards but is often used by
retired adventurers and other sedentary types.

      This  specialized version of the unseen servant was developed with  one
particular task in mind - bartending and barkeeping. The enchanted  bartender
and staff are magical forces under the control of the wizard.

      The  main  power  of the spell creates an enchanted bartender.  It  can
perform simple barkeeping actions like making, serving, and doctoring drinks,
wiping the bar, cleaning dirty drinking vessels, filling snack bowls, etc.

      The  enchanted  bartender can only make mixed drinks  that  the  wizard
himself has prepared at some point in his life. Hopefully, the wizard has the
bartending  nonweapon proficiency so that his enchanted  bartender  can  make
perfect drinks.

     Every three levels, the wizard can create an enchanted barmaid to assist
the  enchanted bartender. Thus, at level 3 the wizard can create one barmaid,
at  level  6  he  can  create two barmaids, at level 9 he  can  create  three
barmaids,  etc.  An  enchanted barmaid cannot mix drinks like  the  enchanted
bartender.  An  enchanted  barmaid can perform simple  barmaid  actions  like
serving drinks and snacks, wiping off tables, sweeping up messes, etc.

      Every six levels, the wizard can create an enchanted bouncer. Thus,  at
level  6  the  wizard can create one bouncer, at level 12 he can  create  two
bouncers, at level 18 he can create three bouncers, etc. An enchanted bouncer
serves  only one purpose: to expel disorderly persons (with the exception  of
the wizard of course) in a bar or tavern. An enchanted bouncer has a Strength
of  18/1d100,  a  Dexterity of 18, and a number of hit points  equal  to  the
wizard's.  If  an  enchanted  bouncer is given  resistance,  he  proficiently
attacks  with non-lethal combat such as punching and wrestling. DMs  must  be
sure  that a player does not abuse an enchanted bouncer's power. It  is  only
created  to  expel disorderly people from a bar or tavern, not to  enter  the
wizard's combative battles while adventuring.

     The enchanted bartender and staff with the exception of the bouncers are
no stronger then an unseen servant and no more dextrous than its creator. The
enchanted bartender and staff can be left to do their duties on their own. If
something  disrupts the smooth flow of their routine (such as the arrival  of
Tiamat),  the  staff will go to the enchanted bartender  who  will  seek  the
advice of its creator.

     All creations may be dispelled by the caster at will. Also, an enchanted
bartender or any staff other than the bouncers can be dispelled by  taking  6
points  of  damage  from  area  of effect attacks  such  as  breath  weapons,
explosions,  etc.  A  dispel magic will get rid of  everybody.  The  material
components of this spell are a block of birch wood and some string.

After the wizard casts this spell, a stream of flaming alcohol shoots out  in
a  straight  line from his clenched fist. The wizard can move the  stream  90
per round. Thus given 4 rounds, the wizard can cover 360 , thus engulfing his
surroundings.
The amount of flaming alcohol is dependent of the wizard's level. A 5th-level
wizard casts a stream: a 5-foot long stream, at a rate of 5 gallon per round.
A  7th-level  wizard casts a fountain: a 10-foot long stream, at  a  rate  10
gallons  per round. A 9th-level wizard casts a geyser: a 20-foot long stream,
at  a  rate 25 gallons per round. A wizard has the option of producing a less
potent flow. For example, a 9th-level wizard is able to cast a geyser but may
opt to cast a fountain or stream.
When  any creature comes in contact with the burning alcohol, it suffers  1d4
points of damage, plus 1 point of damage for each level of experience of  the
wizard.  The liquid will remain for the duration of the spell doing 2  points
of  damage each round. Flammable materials touched by the liquid burn. Things
burning  can  be extinguished in the next round after the spell  ends  if  no
other action is taken. "Stop, Drop, and Roll".
The  wizard's movement is quartered for the duration of the spell.  Also,  he
may  not perform any other actions except aiming the flow. The wizard may not
stop  the flow of the flaming alcohol, only the ending of the spell  will  do
this.

The  material components of the spell are a bar of lye soap, a pint  of  pure
alcohol, and a flame from any source.

This  chaotic  spell  is  respectfully named for  the  Guardian  of  Alcohol,
Lohocla.  Actually  the spell was created by a wizard, with  a  fondness  for
booze,  who  wanted  to pay tribute to the "King" with a  powerful  low-level
spell.  When  Lohocla found out about this tribute, the wizard  was  lavishly
rewarded  with many bottles, barrels, and jugs of excellent wine, beer,  ale,
amead.  They  became quick bar buddies with a hefty tab.  Anyhow,  the  spell
isn't as grand and powerful as it may seem. Although the spell can give great
rewards, it can equally cause as much trouble. Thus, it is a low-level  spell
that  few  wizards would add to their collection. Only the  most  foolish  of
wizards  take  such  an  unpredictable spell. Luckily  most  adventurers  are
foolish.
Within  one  round  of  casting  this spell, the  wizard  magically  conjures
monsters that have a relationship to alcohol (no matter how minute). Roll  on
Table A to see what monsters are summoned. When a wizard reaches ninth level,
he may, at his option, modify the die roll by 1 (up or down), thus giving him
a  choice  of three monsters. Say a 9th-level wizard rolls a 2.  He  can  now
decide to summon a throat leach, a Saint-Bernard dog, or a Clydesdale horse.
Every  four levels, the wizard gets an extra roll on the table if  he  wants.
Thus, at fifth level, the wizard gets two rolls, at ninth level he gets three
rolls, at thirteenth level he gets four rolls, etc.

monsters  can,  if  a  wizard  can communicate with  them  and  if  they  are

      7-10 They attack the spell caster and his comrades to the best of their
ability until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.
     11-12     They act independently of the caster and will act according to
intelligence, alignment, morale, and the DM's wishes.

The creatures vanish when slain. Creatures summoned through tables B or C  do
not check morale.

The  material  components of this spell are a tiny bag, a small  candle  (not
necessarily lit), and half a pint of pure grain alcohol.

Another  odd  spell  supposedly from Lohocla. Like  Lohocla's  Deadly  Bottle
Rockets,  this  spell requires the caster to be intoxicated. Why  the  caster
must  be  intoxicated is better understood with this spell given its  effect,
but it is still a strange requirement. In any case, Lohocla put much power in
this spell in hopes that drunken wizards can still kick some butt in bar room
brawls or anywhere else.
An  unusual  (and  disgusting) spell, this spell cannot be  cast  unless  the
caster is under the influence of alcohol (in a state of slight, moderate,  or
great  intoxication). Of course, the wizard generally doesn't go  adventuring
while drunk, so this becomes a big hindrance if not useless unless the wizard
is  an alcoholic. On the other hand, it can be a real benefit when the wizard
goes  to  a place knowing full well that he will become intoxicated.  Mainly,
because  the chance of spell failure is zero in the case of this spell  (note
that  the chance of spell failure is still there for all other spells).  This
becomes  very valuable because the wizard can get intoxicated, with  all  the
problems  it  entails,  and  always have a memorised  spell  that  will  work
(especially  when  greatly intoxicated when the percentage  chance  of  spell
failure is 100%).
The  burp  is  in  the form of a strong fan-shaped puff of  nauseous  vapours
(described  later)  originates  from the wizard's  mouth  and  moves  in  the
direction he is facing. The force of this "gust of wind" (about 30 miles  per
hour)  is  sufficient  to extinguish candles, torches, and  similaunprotected
flames.  It  causes protected flames - such as those of lanterns -  to  dance
widely  and  has  a  5%  chance  per level of experience  of  the  caster  to
extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the
direction  of  the  wind's movement. It forces back  small  flying  creatures
1d6x10  yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting
to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man sized flying creatures by
50%  for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapours,  and
forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures.
The  burp  doesn't have a nice fresh air scent. Instead, it contains nauseous
vapours.  Any creature caught within the wedge must roll a successful  saving
throw  versus poison or be reeling and unable to attack because of the nausea
for 1d10 rounds. Those who make a successful saving throw are not affected.
Anybody  caught in the wedge of wind may become deaf because of the  burp.  A
person  becomes  totally deaf and unable to hear any sounds.  The  victim  is
allowed a saving throw versus spell. An affected creature has a -1 penalty to
its  surprise  rolls  unless its other senses are  unusually  keen.  Deafened
spellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast any spell with a verbal component.
Non-magical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as  vials,
bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. caught in the burp's force  are
smashed  into  a dozens of pieces. Objects weighing more than one  pound  per
level  of  the  caster  are  not  affected, but  all  other  objects  of  the
appropriate  composition  must save versus crushing  blow  or  be  shattered.
Crystalline creatures usually suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level to
a maximum of 6d6, with a saving throw versus spell for half damage.
Don't forgot to say "Excuse me" after the spell is over.

Lohocla  wanted to help wizards escape from dire situations  or  get  rid  of
their  enemies very quickly. Unfortunately, the spell tries to do both  which
lends  itself  to  chaos  and tends to accomplish  the  wrong  solution.  The
disorder  of  this spell presents itself in many ways, as most  of  Lohocla's
spells  do.  This spell isn't the most powerful spell (although it  may  seem
so),  mainly  because it has a big chance of backfiring.  It  might  get  the
wizard  and  his  comrades out of trouble, but it could give  them  some  new
problems.
When  this spell is used, the wizard is able to teleport a maximum weight  of
250  pounds,  plus  additional 150 pounds for each level of experience  above
tenth  (a  13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 pounds),  to  a  randomly
selected  place. If the optional saving throw is successful, the  wizard  and
any  comrades are teleported instead as long as everybody's weight  is  under
the  maximum weight able to be teleported. It is the DM's decision  who  gets
teleported with the wizard if not everybody can be teleported because of  the
weight restriction.
Roll  on  the  table  below  to  see where the victims  are  teleported.  The
information  is  provided to assist DMs in a running a  clever  and  humorous
scenario.  The places presented here are ideas and suggestions  from  fiction
and  non-fiction  of the past, present, and future. The  DM  should  feel  to
modify  the  locations  as  he sees fit to better suit  his  knowledge  (some
suggestions are give in the description).
The  duration of the spell is 1d30 hours + 2d30 minutes + 2d30  seconds  +  1
hour per level. DMs may opt to decide the duration based on his plans for the
characters  in  the  strange  locations. DMs are  encouraged  to  make  these
encounters  exciting  and unique. If the DM thrusts the  characters  into  an
exciting plot in a bizarre environment, then the DM should not be constrained
by  the  spell's  duration. The spell is intended to add thrills  to  a  PC's
adventuring career and a little fun for the DM's hard work.

     Table A: Locations (1d20).

      1.    Dodge  City Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas (1874, real world).  The
characters  find themselves just outside the swinging doors of  an  old  west
saloon in Dodge City, or an old west city the DM likes. Great scenarios exist
in  the  root-and-tooted wild west. Hopefully, the character's  arrival  will
stir  up  a  lot of trouble with the outlaws, sheriffs, and other interesting
folks.  The DM is referred to the Complete Guide to AD&D Technology  and  the
Boot Hill roleplaying game to assist in handling old west situations.
      2.    Miriam's Place in Nepal (1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark). Miriam's
Place  is  a  dive  nestled  deep in the cold  mountains  of  Nepal.  Miriam,
inherited it from her father Abner, an archaeologist. The adventurcan  appear
in  the  establishment before Indiana Jones or the Nazis show up OR any  time
the DM wishes. Hopefully, the characters will tag along with Indiana Jones as
he  searches  for the Ark of the Covenant (treat as a powerful artifact).  If
DMs  want to allow characters to adventure with Indiana, then he should watch
the  movie and take some serious notes. It will be worth it, even though  the
players have probably seen the movie. DMs may want Indiana to go back to  the
characters' world as an exciting NPC or new PC.
     3.   Rosie's Bar or The Officer's Club at MASH 4077 in Korea (1950-1953,
MASH  television show). The characters find themselves in one  of  the  local
bars  of the MASH 4077. The DM can put them in any time with the old  or  new
cast.  Many  exciting scenarios exist with this mad-capped crew. Frank  Burns
can capture the characters as the enemy. Hotlips could be attracted to one of
the more charismatic characters. The DM should consider picking his favourite
episode and drop the characters in the middle of it. "5:00 Charlie".
      4.    Schott's Brewing Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1950s,  Laverne
and  Shirley). The characters find themselves in the middle of the  Milwaukee
Brewing  company surrounded by bottles travelling on conveyor belts and  lots
of  other  machinery.  Two  young workers, Laverne and  Shirley,  are  nearby
working.  Of course, Laverne and Shirley will have to get involved  with  the
characters,  possibly even asking one of them out for a date (a good  way  to
see  the 20th-century city). DMs should watch the television show to see some
of  the  mad-capped adventures they can get into if they stick with  Laverne,
Shirley, Lenny, and Squiggy.
      5.    The  Regal  Beagle  in  Los Angeles, California  (1980s,  Three's
Company).  The characters find themselves in a corner booth of a  small  pub.
Sitting  nearby by are Jack, Janet, and Chrissie (or Terry). Across the  room
is  Larry, picking up women. The Ropers (or Mr. Firley) are also in the  pub.
Many  exciting plots can develop if the characters interact with the  people.
Of  course,  it should be based on a huge misunderstanding, DMs should  watch
the television show to see how goofy everybody acts. Hopefully, DMs won't  go
crazy watching the show.
      6.    The  Pacific Princess cruise ship somewhere on the Pacific  Ocean
(1980s,  the Love Boat). Possibly one of the worst encounters, the characters
find themselves at the bar by the pool or in the Pirate's Cove on the Pacific
Princess  cruise  ship better known as the Love Boat. Of  course,  the  first
person  they meet will be big-grinned Isaac Washington, the chief  bartender.
Other  ship's crew are Julie McCoy, Gopher, the good doctor, and the captain.
Hopefully, the characters won't be considered stowaways and can interact with
everybody. All kinds of people can be passengers on the ship so the DM may go
nuts with interaction. Please don't let Charo on.
      7.    Alcohol  Anonymous Meeting, anywhere (present, real  world).  The
characters  find themselves outside a door which has "A.A." on  it.  If  they
enter,  the characters see a bunch of people who are discussing their alcohol
problem.  They  openly welcome the characters who must have a  problem  given
their strange appearance and behaviour.
      8.    The Boar's Nest in Hazard County, Georgia (present, The Dukes  of
Hazard). The characters find themselves outside of a grey wood building  with
a  Boar's  Nest sign. There are some interesting motor vehicles in  the  dirt
parking  lot: an orange "racing" car with a 01 on the side and a  confederate
flag  on top, a long white convertible with a bull horn on the hood, a  nice-
looking jeep with a golden eagle on the hood and "Dixie" written on the side,
a  old white pick-up truck, a tow-truck, and two beat-up police cars. If they
enter the building, the characters find a country bar. Among the patrons  are
Uncle  Jesse,  Bo  and  Luke (or sadly Coy and Vince),  Crazy  Cooter,  Enos,
Cledos,  and  the  sexy long-legged Daisy waiting tables in  her  oh-so-tight
shorts.  In a back room can be found Boss Hogg and Roscoe. Oh boy,  the  many
scenarios  in Hazard is unreal. The characters could get hired by  Boss  Hogg
for  a  mischievous task. They could help the Dukes stop Boss Hogg and Roscoe
do  something terrible. They could get the Duke Boys out of trouble.  And  of
course, everybody will want to become Daisy Duke's love interest. Personally,
somebody should beat up Enos, that sissy hillbilly. Whatever scenario the  DM
creates,  it  should be based around the moonshine business.  The  DM  should
definitely have a hide speed car chase with all the jumps. The DM should also
watch the show over and over again to really get the feel of Hazard County.
      9.    Bush  Gardens Amusement Park in Williamsburg, Virginia  (present,
real  world). The characters find themselves riding on the Loch Ness  Monster
Roller  Coaster,  or  another exciting ride. Hopefully,  the  characters  can
survive the ride and tour the amusement park and the brewery. The characters,
dressing as adventurers usually do, will find themselves be approached by the
tourists  thinking  that  they (the characters) are part  of  the  attraction
("Look  honey, get a picture of little Albert with the medieval  mage").  The
only  way  the  characters can get American currency is to sell  their  gold,
silver, copper, and platinum pieces to the tourists (DMs should be stingy  in
this  regard, as the tourists would be). Hopefully, the characters  will  buy
some souvenirs after obtaining some cash. As the advertisement states: "Come.
See. Conquer!".
      10.   Cheers  Bar  in Boston, Massachusetts (present,  Cheers).  "Where
everybody knows your name, and your friends they're glad you came...". That's
right,  the  characters are in the famous Cheers bar with all the  staff  and
patrons: Sam Malone, Norm, Cliff, Frazier, Carla, Rebecca or Diane, Woody  or
Coach. A DM should pick a favourite episode of the television show and thrust
their  characters in the middle of it. Many possible scenarios can take place
in  the  bar.  Their  clothes  alone allow Carla to  insult  the  characters'
wardrobe,  Diane to believe the characters are a theatre group and request  a
performance,  Frazier to try to help them mentally, and  Norm  and  Cliff  to
accept them as long as they get a beer from them.
      11.   The  Corner Cafe in Lavale, Maryland (present, real  world).  The
Corner  Cafe is in the Country Club Mall. This is a typical mall bar and  DMs
should  feel free to change this to a bar in a familiar mall. The main  point
of  this  encounter is to get the characters into a mall. If they can  get  a
hold  of  some  money  and try to fit in, then they  can  have  tons  of  fun
shopping.  Of course, interaction with the mall rent-a-cops would be  fun  as
well.
      12.   HammerJacks  in Baltimore, Maryland (present,  real  world).  The
characters pop in amongst a large wild crowd in the ultimate heavy metal bar.
The characters will mostly go unnoticed because everybody here is weird. Cans
of  warm  beer for only $3.75 and drinks in plastic cups (glass is dangerous)
for even larger prices can be bought. Overflowing toilets, sinks, and garbage
cans  are  in  the  bathroom. But most importantly, the DM  should  have  his
favourite  heavy  metal (or close to heavy metal) group on  stage  with  more
groups  to  come.  If  the  DM can't come up with one,  have  Guns  N'  Roses
preforming when the characters arrive. Then Metallica and then Skid  Row  can
perform.  What  a night, as long as the characters don't get drunk  and  pass
out.  This can lead to many exciting encounters, especially if the characters
can get a hold of 20th-century technology, for example an electric guitar.
      13.  Improv Comedy Club, Los Angeles, California (present, real world).
The characters find themselves in the back of a dark bar. There is a stage in
the  front  on  which  is a person performing comedy.  A  waitress  asks  the
characters  if  they would like to be seated now and then takes  there  drink
orders. This encounter is a great place for the DM to do a comedy routine  if
that  is his forte. Hopefully, the DM will at least put well known comics  on
stage like Dennis Miller.
      14.   Mo's  Tavern in Springfield, U.S.A. (present, The Simpsons).  The
characters find themselves in the cartoon world of The Simpsons. What can  be
more exciting then being a cartoon. They get to me Mo Homer, Barney, and  the
rest  of the drunks. The DM is referred to the Toon roleplaying game to  make
this experience a memorable one.
      15.  The Nudy Bar in Paw Paw, West Virginia (present, real world).  The
DM  can make this a strip bar nearest (and maybe even familiar to) the DM. If
the  DM  is  not  familiar with such things, then the  characters  will  find
themselves  in the back of the Paw Paw, West Virginia Nudy Bar.  The  bar  is
packed  with  loud, obnoxious hillbillies whaling and slobbering over  naked,
tattooed, scarred, somewhat attractive women. Very few people will notice the
oddness of the characters due to the floor show.
      16.   The Safehouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (present, real world, James
Bond  movies).  The characters find themselves outside a fairly  non-descript
cream  brick  building. The Safehouse is just south of the Windham  hotel  on
Water  Street.  There  is a deli on the north side of  the  building,  and  a
restaurant  on  the  west side overlooking the Milwaukee  river.  This  is  a
secretive bar visited by men of government and specifically spies. Walking up
to  the  east side of the building, there is a stairway leading up to a  very
simple  door.  The characters would assume that it is just a warehouse  door,
except for the sign which says "International Exports" (the name of the cover-
company James Bond worked for). There is the main bar, and the "American Bar"
in the Safehouse, along with a restaurant. Message tubes pass orders from the
bars  to the restaurant. The food is excellent, so popular the owners decided
to  open  the deli on the north side of the building (which is an alternative
entrance)  which  serves the same food during the day. There  is  a  hologram
"kissing  booth" where a animated hologram woman blows a kiss for a  quarter,
an  immense sliding wall puzzle in the restaurant, and a few other surprises.
There  is  many exciting arcade games like Strategic Nuclear War, Star  Wars,
Spy  Hunter,  etc.  Waitresses tend to be in elaborate states  of  dress  and
undress. The specialty drink of the house is Spy's Demise. DMs are encouraged
to  load  up  the  Safehouse with spies and government men  from  television,
movies, or the real world.
      17.  Cantina on the planet Tatooine (future, Star Wars). The characters
have  entered  a  bar in a galaxy, far, far away. They are in  the  bar  made
famous  in the Star Wars movie. DMs can have the characters enter the bar  at
the same time Ben Kanobi and Luke Skywalker are trying to get Han Solo to fly
them  off  the planet or the DM can have them appear at any time  during  the
Star  Wars Trilogy (or anytime during a Star Wars roleplaying game campaign).
No  character, no matter how odd-looking, will be out of place in a  location
filled  with a multitude of strange races. They could mistake everything  for
some  spelljamming place (if familiar with spelljamming) until they  see  all
the non-magical technology (laser guns, space ships, etc.). Great interaction
can  exist  with  interaction  between  the  characters  and  the  Star  Wars
personalities.  Clever  DMs  can redo the Star Wars  movies,  the  characters
tagging along with Han and Luke.
     18.  Paul Masons Winery, San Jose, California (present, real world). The
characters get stuck in a tour group at the winery. During the tour they  see
modern wine making in action and then get sent to the wine tasting room for a
little nip.
      19.   Ten  Forward  on  the Enterprise (future,  Star  Trek:  The  Next
Generation).  The characters find themselves in Ten Forward on  the  starship
Enterprise. Unfortunately, the "Intruder Alert" alarm has been set off by the
characters. At this time, the characters will surrounded by ship's  security.
Possibly,  Guiana may realize that the characters are from another  time  and
place  (possibly another dimension) and will interrupt to save  their  hides.
For  high-level  characters, the DM may want to have the Borg  attacking  the
ship  at the time of their arrival. The DM is referred to the Complete  Guide
to  AD&D  Technology and the Complete Guide to AD&D Star Trek  to  assist  in
helping with this place.
      20.   The Promenade on Deep Space 9 (future, Star Trek: Deep Space  9).
The  characters find themselves on the promenade of the Deep  Space  9  space
station.  Quark,  the  local proprietor of Quark's Place  in  the  Promenade,
greets  the characters and tries to sell them many goods and services.  Visit
the  holo-suite?  Interact with the Starfleet officers? Maybe  the  borg  are
attacking  the  station?  The DM is referred to the Complete  Guide  to  AD&D
Technology and the Complete Guide to AD&D Star Trek to assist in helping with
this place.

Creates  an extradimensional space into which the affected creature is  sent.
While  there,  no  spellcasting or psionic use is possible. Occupant  can  be
released  on  caster command, or expelled at the spell's end  to  suffer  1d6
points  of damage (25% chance to end up on ethereal plane). The occupant  can
see  and hear events around the area where they were when the spell was cast,
but  cannot alter them. This spell has been rather heinously ripped off  from
the warp marble: see the Tome of Magic, page 148.

This  spell  causes  a written item to be moved to a small pocket  dimension,
created by the spell. For the spell's duration, the item can be called  forth
by  a  mental command from the caster. The caster cannot call forth if he  is
insane, feebleminded, etc. When the item appears, it is invisible to all  but
the  caster  and  can only be detected by true seeing or  godlike  powers  (a
dragon  could  not  detect it). It can also be detected by  touch.  The  item
floats  one  foot in front of the caster's face, moving with him. The  caster
can  see  through  it  at  will, or can make it appear translucent,  doubling
reading  time but allowing him to detect movement on the other side.  He  can
see  the  item even in darkness, though not magical darkness. Pages, if  any,
turn  at the caster's will. The item can be sent back at will until the spell
ends.  If  the spell's duration expires and the item is still in  the  pocket
dimension, it is spilled into a random plane. The material component of  this
spell is a glass prism, which is consumed in the casting.

For  purposes of magical detection, this spell changes the apparent alignment
of  the victim. It can be negated with a successful disbelief only by someone
who  knows the victim well enough that they believe without a doubt that they
are of a different alignment. This spell is not detectable with detect magic,
and  cannot  be  dispelled by dispel magic. Only a full wish can  remove  its
effect  before  duration ends. The spell cannot be used on those  of  demigod
status  or  higher. The material component is an item from the victim  (hair,
toenail, blood, etc.).

This spell causes a number of magical items to be undetectable as magical  by
any  means  short  of the scrutiny of a greater god. The item  cannot  be  in
physical contact with another being of more than animal Intelligence  at  the
time of casting. The spell lasts until the item is no longer magical, and can
be  cast  on an item before it is magical, as long as it is magically endowed
in the following round. Can also be cast with enchant an item.

The sending spell was created by Lorth the Traveller as a more versatile form
of teleport. When the spell is cast, one creature for every two levels of the
wizard  (rounded  down) is sent to a place defined by the  wizard  as  for  a
teleport  spell  (the  wizard must have a mental image  of  the  place).  The
creatures must be touching the wizard, but "chains" are possible. The  wizard
does  not  have to accompany them, but he may if he so desires. There  is  no
chance of error for this spell.
If  any  of the creatures sent is harmed within 5 minutes of arrival, all  of
them  will  be  bounced back to the place from which they were sent  (whether
they  want  to go or not). Any damage incurred during those five minutes,  to
themselves or their equipment, is erased. Note that this does not  allow  the
spell to be used as a quick and easy messenger spell; anything dropped during
the five minute grace period is returned with its owner. This can be used  as
a fail-safe teleport. After the five minute period elapses, the spell expires
and  the  protected individuals are on their own. The sending will  not  work
across  planar boundaries. Unwilling creatures receive a saving throw  versus
death magic to resist this spell.

This  spell was designed as either a sort of temporal stasis effect, or as  a
way  of removing enemies without killing them. The creature touched is placed
into  its  own extra-dimensional space, where no time passes. After one  turn
for  each  level of the wizard has elapsed, the creature will be returned  to
the  prime material plane in exactly the same state it was when the spell  is
cast (including location).
If  an  object  has been placed in the location from which the  creature  was
sent,  the  subject will be displaced the shortest possible distance  in  any
direction consonant with emerging in open space. For instance, if the  tunnel
has collapsed since the spell was cast, the creature might be displaced a few
tens  of  yards  up  to  the surface of the earth, if this  is  the  shortest
displacement  that  will allow the creature to be placed  in  an  open  area.
However,  if  there should happen to be a cavity in the debris  blocking  the
tunnel, the subject would most likely be deposited there.

Lorth's  translocation  is  a the most advanced  teleport  class  spell  ever
devised. Given a description of any sort, the wizard is able to place himself
at the specific location. The description might be a detailed mental image, a
verbal  description, a painting, "thirty feet due east", "the centre  of  the
room   in  which  stands  the  sceptre  of  Ashkamankh",  or  anything   else
sufficiently  precise. If there does not exist a location  such  as  the  one
described, nothing will happen. If the description is insufficiently  precise
(a field of grass, the centre of a forest), the spell will have no effect. If
the  location  does exist, then the wizard will be placed  there,  no  matter
where it is.
This  spell can transport the wizard to any plane, any distance. Note however
that  it is very, very difficult to describe a specific place in planes  such
as  the astral or the ethereal, due to the lack of good landmarks. Of course,
if  there  should  happen to be a solid object in the  place  described,  the
wizard is slain instantly.

The  spell will cause the target to fall in love with the caster and can only
be  broken by the seductress betraying or attacking the target (of course the
spell can be broken by a dispel charm or limited wish). The target will  stay
with the seductress as long as he lives. The target will protect, honour, and
love the seductress.

This spell makes its recipient become so much in love with the wizard that as
soon  as  he (or she) loses sight of the wizard, the victim begins  to  waste
away.  The victim stops eating food, turns to drinking, and becomes a general
wreck, fighting at a -5. As a result, he (she) will die of malnutrition in  a
number  of days equal to his (her) Constitution plus 10, and there is  a  10%
chance of him (her) committing suicide. What's more, if the wizard tells  him
(her)  to  go away, he (she) is compelled to do so. This unpleasant condition
may  wear  off  as  a  charm person, but otherwise must be  treated  by  cure
disease.

This  spell allows the priest to lower a person's alcohol addiction by 2  per
class  level  in  the drinking and amount levels. For example,  a  5th  level
priest  casts  this  spell on a addicted person (level 8  drinking,  level  4
amount).  The  priest  gets 10 to work with (5 2) and decides  to  lower  the
drinking  level by 8 and the amount level by 2. Thus the addicted person  now
has a drinking level of 0 and an amount level by 2. A pretty good start for a
speedy recovery (see the Net Alcohol Guide for more information).

This  spell  gives the person affected a bonus to all rolls  of  +1  for  the
duration  of  the  spell. Rolls include to-hit rolls, saving throws,  ability
checks,  proficiency  checks,  etc. Also, the  recipient's  Armour  Class  is
improved by one. As material component for this spell various things  can  be
used,  like a four-leaf clover, a rabbit's paw, or a horse-shoe. The material
components are consumed on a roll of 1 on a six-sided die.

This  spell will cause a male to kiss and hug the nearest person and not  let
go.  The  target will follow his victim until the duration of the spell.  The
seductress must be careful not to cast this spell near herself.
The  reverse of this spell, hate, will cause the target to attack the closest
person  (this may even be the caster) in the area for no reason. If he  kills
this target, he will attack more victims until the spell has expired.

This  spell inflicts lycanthropy on a character or creature. Since it is non-
magical in nature, this lycanthropy cannot be cured by a dispel magic, though
it  can be cured in the way ordinary lycanthropy can be healed. Note that the
victim  must  be touched for the entire casting time for the  spell  to  take
effect. The material component for this spell is a lycanthrope's tooth  or  a
fresh drop of a lycanthrope's blood.

This  powerful  dweomer  causes the sealing  of  a  thing  with  far  greater
effectiveness than that caused by a hold portal or a wizard lock  spell.  The
mage  lock can only be cast on certain things: boxes or chests made of  iron,
steel, or harder metals, or on doors made of the same and set into a wall  at
least as hard as hard stone.
When  the mage lock is cast, the wizard chooses a single person - other  than
himself - who is to be able to open the sealed box, chest, or door. When  the
spell is done the item is sealed and only the individual who was named in the
casting will be able to open it. The item will be unaffected by knock spells,
chimes of opening, or similar magics, and will have a magic resistance of 25%
with regard to other magics, and a +2 on all saving throws.
If  the person named in the spell should die before the item is opened -  for
the spell holds only until the item is opened once - then the item cannot  be
opened  by anyone until the caster of the spell is dead. If the item has  not
been  opened by the time both the wizard and the person named die,  the  mage
lock dissipates.

The material components of this spell are: a diamond, worth no less than 5000
gp,  4  small iron cubes, and a drop of blood from the person to be named  in
the spell.

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a "third eye", much like the spell
wizard  eye, except that it remains in a specific location once cast. It  can
be  triggered in two ways, the first being a predefined event occurring, such
as some creature passing in front of it. The second can be done from anywhere
on the same plane, by willing it to activate. Once activated the eye lasts  2
rounds  per level; however, the magic eye can be reactivated (each activation
uses a minimum of 2 rounds). The magic eye sees as well as the wizard: if the
wizard can normally see invisible so can the eye. Magic enhancements, such as
spectacles or see invisible, do not work through the magic eye. The  material
component for this spell is an eye of some sort.

The  flask, or any other drinking vessel, is enchanted so as to hold 5  times
its  normal  capacity. The spell is not cumulative in any way and the  wizard
can enchant one flask per round, making an total of 10 flasks with one spell.
If  the  wizard  attempts multiple castings of this spell on the  flask,  the
flask  will  explode, shattering everywhere. This ruins the spell completely.
The material component are the flasks to be enchanted.
Note:  other,  different enchantment spells may be  cast  on  the  flask,  if
allowed.

For  this  spell to take effect, the wizard makes a cone out of  a  sheet  of
parchment  and places inside it one copper coin for each 5 minutes  of  spell
effect.  The  magic  words are chanted and the parchment  cone  crumpled  and
released.  When the parchment cone is crumpled, it is replaced  by  a  4-inch
diameter  black  sphere which remains at its location  of  creation  for  the
duration of the spell.
The  black  sphere is the centre of a cylinder 10 feet high  with  a  10-foot
radius.  Any  sound  within  the  cylinder is projected  into  a  surrounding
cylinder  which is 100 feet high and has a 100-foot radius. The black  sphere
is also the centre of this cylinder.
Anyone  within  the  100 foot cylinder hears sounds as  if  they  were  in  a
corresponding location within the 10 foot cylinder.
This  spell  was  created  my Michael Verilait,  a  wizard  who  was  usually
frustrated at not being able to hear what was happening on stage.

This  improvement on the 1st-level magic missile allows the wizard to fire  1
missile  per  2 levels of experience. Each bolt can be individually  targeted
and  does 1d8 points of damage. The spell fires that number of missiles every
round  until  the wizard is hit or ends the spell. After the initial  casting
the missiles have a speed factor of 1 each and the wizard may move, or engage
in any other action besides spellcasting after the missiles fire.

air.  The  creature has spellcasting ability, and can cast its own spells  as
well  as  any spells given to it by the wizard (if the wizard had the  spells
memorised when he cast the Magic Mist spell).
Other than this increased ability, these mists conform to the attacking  mist
spell.

Intelligent mists are normally solitary creatures who exist on the  elemental
plane  of  air.  They  normally only occur on the prime material  plane  when
summoned by a talking mist, attacking mist or magic mist spell, which  summon
a mist of class I, II, and III respectively.
Combat: messenger mists (class I) only attack in self-defense, and even  then
they can avoid a conflict by dissipating. Guardian mists (class II) attack by
making whip-like appendages semi-corporeal. On an attack roll of 20, the mist
has  succeeded in either suffocating its enemy which causes 1d6 point  damage
for each roll (no attack roll necessary) until the victim is dead or the mist
is destroyed.
When a mist's hit points reach 0 on the prime material plane, the creature is
not  killed,  but is sent back to it own plane. Killing it on its  own  plane
does kill it.
Monarch mists (class III) have the following spells which they can cast  once
per day: wall of fog; fog cloud; darkness, 15-foot radius; gust of wind; wind
wall and lightning bolt. They cast these as 7th-level wizards.

The  material component for a magic mist spell is a piece of paper  with  the
orders  for  the mist written on it, which must be burnt in the casting.  The
ink used must be extracted from rare berries, worth at least 20 gp.

      Casting  magic  motes creates a number of motes  of  light  around  the
caster.  One  mote is created at first level with one additional  mote  being
created for every two levels of the caster beyond first to a maximum of  five
(as  per  magic  missile). Each mote moves to intercept physical  attacks  or
magical attacks that have some physical or magical form. The motes reduce the
damage  from  such attacks by 1d4+1 points. Each attack causes  one  mote  to
disappear, except for area effect spells, which cause all the remaining motes
to  wink  out  of  existence. If not used within one turn per  level  of  the
caster, any remaining motes wink out.

This spell creates a sphere that has all the properties of a Forgotten Realms
dead  magic area (see the Forgotten Realms Adventures for details). The  area
of dead magic is permanent until destroyed (it may only be destroyed as per a
dead magic area). The sphere of dead magic is non-mobile.

resis The amount provided to the recipient is 1% per level of the caster,  up
to  a maximum of 20%. During the course of the spell, the recipient gains the
benefits  of a naturally magic resistant creature, including the  ability  to
lower  the protection provided by this spell temporarily (for healing  magic,
for  instance). See the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide for  the
effects of magic resistance.
Unfortunately,  the spell is not without its side effects. At the  expiration
of  the  spell,  the  recipient must make a saving throw versus  death  magic
without  any bonuses provided by magic items, potions, spells and so forth  -
failure  to save indicates that a magic item (determined randomly,  excluding
artifacts) is drained permanently of any enchantments.
If  cast upon a creature with natural magic resistance, or already under  the
effect  of  a  prior  magic  resistance spell, the spell  has  no  beneficial
effects,  although  the draining of a magic item may still  occur.  Also,  an
unwilling creature automatically resists this spell.
A  piece of flesh of a naturally magic resistant creature is required to cast
this spell.

     This tough science allows the psionicist to scan an object or
person  for  information on any magic present.   On  objects,  the
power  will reveal the type of magic (alteration, summoning, etc.)
they  contain, but not which spells or specific powers they  have.
Further  rounds might reveal other lesser types of magic found  on
the  object.  Thus, a staff of power could be scanned for  several
rounds,  and several results would be obtained, with the strongest
magics being detected first.  If a spellcasting proficiency  check
is  made,  the  psionicist will now hazy details about  the  magic
involved.   (The  staff  can protect you, or  it  can  cover  your
enemies with deadly flames, etc.).
      On  persons,  the  power analyzes any spells  cast  on  that
person.   Each  round  spent reveals what spell  is  cast  on  the
person,  again starting with the most powerful.  If a spellcasting
proficiency  check succeeds, at a +2 bonus, the  psionicist  knows
how long the spells on that person will last.

Magic  swarm  is  both a very potent, and a very unstable  spell.  With  this
spell,  the wizard may bind up to three attack-type spells (those that  cause
any  type  of  damage)  together  into  one  spell.  The  wizard  begins  the
incantations of the magic swarm and then "loads" the spells to be bound  into
the  swarm  (this  effectively casts the spells - the proper  components  are
required, and the loaded spells fade from memory; magic swarm is the "target"
for these spells). The wizard then finishes the binding process by continuing
the  incantations of the swarm. This entire process takes two turns plus  the
casting times of the spells to be bound.
When   magic   swarm  is  actually  cast,  the  bound  spells  are   released
simultaneously (this has a casting time of 3). However, due the unpredictable
nature of this spell, there is a chance that some of the bound spells may not
function  normally. At the time of casting, the DM rolls 1d3; the  result  is
the number of spells that work properly - the remaining spells fizzle and are
lost  (the spells go off in the order they were bound, so it is important  to
keep track of the order).
Due  to  the  extreme  exertion required to cast this  spell,  the  following
penalties and stipulations are placed on its use:
          Only one magic swarm may be memorised in any two-day period.
           After  magic swarm is cast (actually cast, not after binding),  no
further spell casting is possible for one turn (10 minutes).
           After  the  spell  is  cast,  the  wizard  temporarily  loses  1d4
Constitution points; if this brings the wizard's Constitution score  to  zero
or  below,  a  system shock roll must be made; if this roll  is  failed,  the
wizard  dies,  otherwise  he  falls into a coma  until  his  Constitution  is
restored  to  a  positive value; it takes one hour of  rest  to  restore  one
Constitution point lost in this manner.
          If the magic swarm is not cast in one hour per level of the wizard,
the wizard must make a saving throw versus spell; if this saving throw fails,
the  swarm  will  discharge will full effect, centred on the wizard  (1d3  is
still  rolled  to  determine how many spells actually go  off  and  how  many
fizzle);  if  the saving throw is successful, magic swarm simply  fades  from
memory and is lost (along with all bound spells).

The  material component for this spell is a bag of holding (which effectively
"holds"  the spells in the bound state). When the spell is cast, the  bag  is
destroyed unless the wizard makes a successful saving throw versus spell at -
2.

This  is  an  even  more  powerful version of minor annoyance  and  annoyance
(q.v.). It makes the victim's leg hurt, exactly as if he has barked his  shin
on  something.  Although causing no damage, it is painful enough  to  disrupt
spell  casting in the round it is cast in, as well as subsequent  rounds,  to
the  limit  of  the  spell. The victim also suffers combat penalties:  Armour
Class bonuses due to high Dexterity are negated, and attacks are made at a -2
penalty.
A successful saving throw versus this spell reduces the duration of the spell
to  one round per two levels of the wizard, and reduces the attack penalty to
-1.

The  material  component is a coffee bean, carved to look  like  a  miniature

With  this  spell,  several wizards can combine their magical  abilities  and
powers  to  create greater spells. If several casters want to  combine  their
efforts,  they must first decide who will be the head weaver. This person  is
the  centre  of the spell: without him, the entire spell structure collapses.
Also,  if  he loses concentration all the efforts are lost and the spells  as
well.  Next, they must decide which spell they are going to create. To create
this  spell, they may use several different or all the same spells of  weaker
levels which, combined, give the desired spell. These spells must in some way
be  related  to  the  desired spell. The DM should rule what  spells  can  be
combined.
To participate, all members of a "spellcloth" must roll their chance to learn
spells:  if they miss it, they lose the spell and their effort isn't  counted
into  the whole of the spell. If the head weaver misses his roll, he  made  a
mistake in the weaving of the spells into the new one and everything is lost.
To  calculate  how much energy is created, take the number of mages  involved
(specialists count as 1« if they cast a spell within their specialty but as «
if  not)  and  divide  this  number by the total  number  of  mages  involved
(specialist  now  count as one). If the resulting figure is larger  than  1¬,
make  it  equal to that number. Multiply this number by the total  number  of
spell  levels  involved (i.e.: add all levels of the individual spells).  Now
add  1  to this number and round down. If the energy created by the cloth  is
not  enough  to  form the desired spell, the next spell in  line  is  created
instead.
The  experience  level at which the spell is cast is the head weaver's  level
plus half the level of every other wizard involved. If this is lower than the
minimum needed to cast the final spell then the spell is still cast,  but  at
the casting level of this imaginary lower level wizard.
Because  spell  weaving  takes  a  lot  of  time,  spellweavers  always  lose
initiative. Also, the weavers cannot be separated by more than 10  feet,  and
no  barriers may be between any individual and the head caster. The number of
mages involved is also limited: 7 for a major weaving. Minor weavers count as
when  included in a major weaving for the purpose of calculating the  maximum
number of mages. A major weaver counts as   if included in a master weaving.
Major  weaving can only take 6th-level or lower spells to weave  successfully
(the desired spell can be of higher level).

This  spell makes 1 to 4 creatures or objects flammable. For the duration  of
the  spell,  they  are  as flammable as wood. If they catch  fire  they  burn
entirely  and  turn to ash in the time it takes wood of their size  to  burn.
This  fire is normal fire and may be extinguished by the usual means. It does
not  matter what materials the objects or creatures are made of. They can  be
inflamed  by  natural or magical fire or extreme heat, but the  spell  itself
does  not inflame them. Once they have caught fire they get damage from heat,
but  also turn to ash within the time specified. After that, the duration  of
the  spell  does not matter. Each creature or object gets a saving throw:  if
only  one is the subject of the spell it has a penalty of  2 to its roll;  if
two  are  subject, each receives a penalty of  1; if three are subject,  each
receives a bonus of +1; if four are subject, each receives a bonus of +2. The
material components are a chip of wood and the caster's holy symbol.

This rather mean-spirited spell causes alcoholic beverages within the area of
effect  to  detonate  violently. Fluids which are already  within  a  being's
system  are immune to this effect, but a drink being held to one's  mouth  at
the  time of detonation will still explode. The wizard designates a spherical
area  of  effect somewhere within range as his target point (with  a  maximum
radius of 3 yards, and a minimum radius of « foot). All such beverages within
this  area  will then immediately blow up. Damage caused (in hit points)  and
blast radius (in yards) by drink and quantity are detailed below:

     Drink     Quantity Present
     Type 1 cup     1 bottle  1 keg     Barrel or larger
     Beer 1d3, «    1d4, 1    1d4, 2    2d4, 4
     Ale  1d4, 1    1d4, 2    1d6, 3    3d4, 4
     Wine 1d4, 1    2d4, 2    2d4, 3    2d6, 4
     Mead 1d6, 2    2d6, 3    4d4, 4    3d8, 5
     Liquor    1d10, 2   3d6, 4    2d12, 5   5d8, 6

Amounts  of  damage are added, and blast radius is determined  by  using  the
greater radius. For example, if the spell were directed at a table with three
glasses of wine and a bottle of whisky, the blast radius would be 4 yards and
the  damage caused would be 3d4+3d6. A liquor cabinet or wine cellar has  the
potential for much destruction with this spell.
Beings  within the blast radius may make a saving throw versus spell to  take
only  half damage, unless they were drinking from an exploding liquid at  the
time,  in  which case they must save or take double damage (double from  that
explosion only).
The  explosion may cause incidental fires, and tends to leave behind rays  of
black carbonization on materials within the radius.

With  this  spell,  the wizard can create a pattern for use  with  the  spell
Malta's pattern transport. The pattern can be any image with any colours, but
it  must include a circle which forms the outer edge. Thpattern may be of any
size, but the cost of making the pattern is dependent on the materials used -
so  bigger  patterns cost more. The pattern can be woven into cloth,  painted
onto cloth or a hard surface, or inlaid into a hard surface. The pattern must
be  at  least one yard in diameter with no maximum size. The cost to  make  a
pattern is equal to the square yards of the pattern times the amount below:

     Material  Cost Time Saving Throw
     Painted on Cloth    5 Silver  1 hour    15
     Woven into Cloth    1 Gold    10 hours  12
     Woven into Rug 2 Gold    15 hours  10
     Painted on Wood     1 Gold    3 hours   10
     Painted on Stone    2 Gold    4 hours   8
     Inlaid in Wood 3 Gold    12 hours  5
     Inlaid in Stone     5 Gold    16 hours  2

Patterns cannot be repaired, they must be remade completely. Patterns can  be
moved  (assuming the material can be moved as one unit) without  damage.  The
saving  throw listed is the saving throw the pattern must make when used  for
transport  (see  Malta's pattern transport for details) - the material  saves
normally for any other damaging situation.

With  this  spell, the wizard can imprint the size and image of an  undamaged
pattern.  This imprinted image can later be used by the wizard  to  create  a
matching  pattern  of his own. The imprinted image can  be  recalled  by  the
wizard for up to one month per wizard's level (at casting time). If this time
is  exceeded,  or  the wizard creates a matching pattern (even  if  different
size),  then  the  imprinted image is dispelled. This spell is  necessary  to
create  an exact size matching pattern if the original pattern is not present
for  the  creation of the matching pattern. The wizard can  have  up  to  one
imprinted image per size per level at a time.

With  this  spell, the wizard can move himself and other materials  from  one
pattern to another pattern. The two patterns must have the same image and the
destination pattern must be at least as big in radius as the source  pattern.
Both  patterns must be known to the wizard (current locations) and they  must
be laid flat. The destination pattern must not be supporting any object (even
partially). The destination pattern must also be uncovered such that there is
room for the incoming creatures or objects.
If  all  of the above conditions exist, then casting the spell will transport
the wizard and any objects or creatures which are completely supported by the
source  pattern to the destination pattern. All objects transported will  end
up on the destination pattern at the same ratio of distance to the edge as on
the  source pattern. That is, if an object is halfway from the centre to  the
edge  on the source pattern, then it will be halfway from the centre  to  the
edge  on  the  destination pattern (regardless of the size of the destination
pattern).
An  object is considered to be completely supported by the pattern  when  its
weight  is  supported by the material inscribed in the outer  circle  of  the
pattern or by something which is itself completesupported. That means that  a
person  held in the air by another will be transported only if the holder  is
completely  supported. Flying creatures must not be flying  at  the  time  of
transport.
To  cast  the  spell,  the wizard must stand in the centre  of  an  undamaged
pattern  and  cast the spell. In the first round of the casting, the  pattern
will  begin  to glow (each colour of the pattern will emit its  own  colour).
Over  the  next  eight  rounds,  the  pattern  brightness  will  increase  to
approximately  the same as outside on a sunny day. As the last  word  of  the
spell  is  stated, the brightness of the pattern doubles and  all  completely
supported objects or creatures are transported to the destination pattern.
If the destination pattern is not available (see above), then the transported
objects or creatures are returned to the source pattern after one second (and
the  source pattern's saving throw is at -4). The source pattern is subjected
to  some  heat  and  other  energies in the course of  the  transport.  These
energies  cause the source pattern to make a saving throw or  be  damaged  (a
single crack or burn mark will alter the pattern and render it unusable). The
destination pattern is not subjected to the same amount of energy, so it does
not need to make a saving throw.
The  lighting  conditions at the destination pattern do not  change,  so  the
transported  creatures  will  have to adjust to  the  current  lighting  (1d2
rounds, depending on lighting).
Some notes:
          Tossing a rug over an inlaid pattern prevents incoming transports.
           Rolling  up a rug or cloth pattern prevents incoming and makes  it
easier to transport the pattern.
           The  only bi-directional patterns are exactly the same size (hence
the pattern Image spell).
           The  wizard must remain in the middle for all of the casting,  but
creatures or objects also transported only have to be on the pattern  in  the
last seconds.

This  spell allows the priest to command any mammal within range as  long  as
the  mammal can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal mammals  can
be  affected, including variants in size. Thus polar bears, whales, etc., can
be  commanded but sphinxes and xorns cannot. The command must be given  in  a
short  sentence of at most 25 words. The mammal will automatically understand
the language the priest is speaking. Note that for this purpose, humans, demi-
humans  and  humanoids are not considered mammals. Since  familiars  are  not
considered to be normal animals, they cannot be commanded by this spell.  The
material component of this spell is a nail of a mammal.

Marty's  magic bow causes a magical force to propel objects from the wizard's
fingers  much as a bowstring. With arrows, the effect is to allow the  wizard
to release one arrow per round, each arrow attacking as a fighter of half the
level  of the wizard. The advantage of this spell is the fact that the  arrow
attacks  are not magical: thus there is no magical saving throw involved  for
the  target, so if the wizard makes his to-hit roll (at half his level on the
fighter  table) he hits, even if the target is, say, in an anti-magic  shell,
or in a cube of force, or if the target is magic resistant.
There's probably a material component (say, a length of string made of silver
thread,  or  something like that) but the arrows are not components  -  i.e.,
they're  not  consumed, and you might be able to reclaim some of them.  Also,
magical arrows would provide the appropriate bonuses to-hit and to damage.

This  spell  creates  a  shell  of illusion focused  upon  one  drunken  (but
conscious) creature. Its purpose is to cause all observers to look  upon  the
affected creature as entirely sober. It insidiously affects their perceptions
so that they will interpret the person's actions and statements as those of a
rational,  sober  individual. Any slurring of the speech, inconsistencies  in
statements, wobbling, or weaving will be overlooked or ascribed to some other
factor.  True  seeing or other means of bypassing illusions are effective  in
countering this spell.
The  reverse,  unbelievable sobriety, will convince observers  that  a  sober
creature is hopelessly drunk, and works on their perceptions in similar  (but
opposite) ways. In all other respects it is as the former application.

This  spell will instantaneously create a sphere of intense light, that  will
almost certainly blind any creature inside the area of effect. A saving throw
versus  paralysation  at a -4 penalty is needed to avoid permanent  blindness
for those within the sphere. Those who do make their save are blinded for the
next  2d8 hours. Creatures in the sphere will also take 1d2 per level  damage
due to flash burns, a successful saving throw results in half damage.
Also,  any  creature who looks at the light must make the same  saving  throw
(without the penalty) or risk going blind for 2d8 hours. A successful  saving
throw - from this point - will result in no ill effects.

The  material components are 10 fireflies enclosed in a crystal sphere of  at
least 500 gp. This is thrown and shattered at the impact area.

When  this  spell  is cast, the wizard establishes a link with  the  item  he
holds.  Immediately after casting this spell, the wizard  must  cast  another
touch ranged spell or the effects of the transferral are negated. The casting
time of this second spell equals its original casting time plus 1. The second
spell is cast in the same round as the first.
Whenever  the  item hits another creature, the effects of  the  second  touch
spell immediately take effect. The spell stays in the item until it either is
discharged, or the second spell's duration runs out.
A permanency spell cast on an item with transferral cast on it, will have the
effect  of  the transferral until dispelled (note that the second spell  will
not be permanent).

The material component of this spell is the item on which the transferral  is
to  take  place.  Note that this implies that the item  is  consumed  in  the
casting (but after the discharge).

When this spell is cast, every creature in the area of effect (including  the
priest) up to one creature per level of the priest is cured for 1d8 plus half
the  level  of  the priest points of damage. This is as per  the  cure  light
wounds  spell (q.v.). The limitations on which creatures can be thus affected
is  as per that spell. If more creatures than can be affected are within  the
spell radius, preference is given to those closest to the priest. Also, if  a
nearby creature cannot be affected by the spell, it still counts towards  the
total number of possible creatures cured.
The  reverse of the spell, mass hurt, does the same amount of hit  points  of
damage to all within the spell radius. The material component for this  spell
is  a  vial of holy or unholy water that must be sprinkled into the air above
the priest's head while the spell is cast.

Mass  death  is a modified version of power word, kill. After  one  round  of
verbal  and  somatic preparations, the wizard is ready to utter the  word  of
death.  This  word can be uttered any time within one turn per level  of  the
wizard,  provided no other spells except shout or ventriloquism, are cast  in
the intervening time.
All  creatures (besides the wizard) within the range of the spell,  including
allies,  having  one third of the wizard's level or less,  must  save  versus
death  magic  or  be instantly slain. A shout will double  the  range,  while
ventriloquism  will allow the wizard to move the centre  of  effect.  Use  of
either  spell grants the victims a +4 bonus on their saving throw due to  the
magical synergy.
It should be noted that the final word must be heard by its victims. The deaf
are  therefore totally immune to this spell. Magical silence can  negate  the
spell's   effect,  while  loud  noises  and  ear  plugs  will  offer  partial
protection, i.e. saving throw bonuses, at the DM's digression.
This  spell does not affect undead or creatures without functioning  auditory
orga

Mass  flesh to stone is the ultimate attack spell of earth elementalists.  It
affects  up  to one creature per two levels in a 40-foot cube. If  there  are
more  creatures in the area, those to be affected are selected randomly.  All
those  affected  must save versus petrification or be turned  to  stone.  The
reverse  of  this spell, mass flesh to stone, operates normally, except  that
normal stone cannot be turned to flesh.

The material component of this spell is a significant part of a creature that
can  naturally  turn  flesh to stone. The eye of a  basilisk  or  medusa,  or
several snakes from the head of a medusa would suffice.

This  spell  has the same effect as speed casting, except that  it  works  on
multiple persons. They have to be linked in a circle. The caster has to touch
only one person in the circle. He can choose which persons in the circle gain
the  power  -  up  to maximum spell capacity. The caster  has  to  quaff  the
material component: a potion of speed and a potion of human control  at  once
(roll  for  potion miscibility). If an immiscible result comes up, the  spell
failed. No matter how ageless or protected the character is, he has to roll a
system shock roll at half Constitution. If he fails, he dies and ages 10 true
years  per  person  in  the  circle, no matter what  protection  he  had.  If
successful, the caster ages only one true year per person in the  circle  and
survives otherwise.
In  the  reverse, mass slow casting, there does not have to be a circle  (the
range  is  10  feet), but the effects are the same as under the slow  casting
spell, for any spell caster that can be affected by this spell. A maximum  of
one  person per 3 caster levels can be affected with this spell. All  persons
to  be affected have to be within an area of no more than 100 square feet per
caster level.

This spell has the same effect as prevent spoilage, but in a much larger area
of  effect  with an increased duration. In addition to that it also  prevents
food  from being spoiled even if it is dropped into a sewer   if it is washed
or  rubbed off even slightly, the filth will be removed and the food will  be
as  good as it had been at the day of the spell casting. Obviously, if it  is
cast on already rotten food, it will not change its quality into good, but it
will  prevent  further  decomposition. Both prevent spoilage  spells  may  be
applied  to  easily decaying plant (or even mineral) poisons    if  they  are
treated  with  this spell they will be untarnished by time. Once  this  spell
runs out, the previously protected material will start to decay at its normal
pace again.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a piece  of  a
grain  storage sack which has somehow survived over one hundred years without
magical prevention of its decomposition.

This spell is basically a higher level version of the 5th-level teleport. The
main  difference  lies in the amount of mass that can be transported  by  the
wizard. In addition to the wizard, 1200 pounds per level over tenth level may
be transported. Basically, this spell is for bulk rate transfers of material.
The  range  simply refers to the maximum radius outward from  the  centre  of
effect (usually the wizard) that people and things can be to be teleported.
This  was a very popular spell with parties of adventurers that had  lots  of
money  to  spend on transportation. As such, the wizards who could cast  this
spell  tended  to charge through the nose for it. It's not an easy  spell  to
find,  but  it  is very, very useful. Of course, it's just a matter  of  time
before  somebody  else  (or  a group of others)  break  into  the  action  by
researching a similar spell.

This  is  basically  an improved magic missile. It does not  have  a  maximum
number of missiles: you get one more every even numbered level, starting with
three  at  twelfth level. When dealing with magic resistance, each individual
missile get a roll of its own, and once one gets by the magic resistance, all
remaining ones will as well (a "chink" in the armour has been found).  Damage
per missile is 1d4+2.

With  this  spell,  several wizards can combine their magical  abilities  and
powers  to  create greater spells. If several casters want to  combine  their
efforts,  they must first decide who will be the head weaver. This person  is
the  centre  of the spell: without him, the entire spell structure collapses.
Also,  if  he loses concentration all the efforts are lost and the spells  as
well.  Next, they must decide which spell they are going to create. To create
this  spell, they may use several different or all the same spells of  weaker
levels which, combined, give the desired spell. These spells must in some way
be  related  to  the  desired spell. The DM should rule what  spells  can  be
combined.
To participate, all members of a "spellcloth" must roll their chance to learn
spells:  if they miss it, they lose the spell and their effort isn't  counted
into  the whole of the spell. If the head weaver misses his roll, he  made  a
mistake in the weaving of the spells into the new one and everything is lost.
To  calculate  how much energy is created, take the number of mages  involved
(specialists count as 1« if they cast a spell within their specialty but as «
if  not)  and  divide  this  number by the total  number  of  mages  involved
(specialist  now  count as one). If the resulting figure is larger  than  1¬,
make  it  equal to that number. Multiply this number by the total  number  of
spell  levels  involved (i.e.: add all levels of the individual spells).  Now
add  2  to this number and round down. If the energy created by the cloth  is
not  enough  to  form the desired spell, the next spell in  line  is  created
instead.
The  experience  level at which the spell is cast is the head weaver's  level
plus half the level of every other wizard involved. If this is lower than the
minimum needed to cast the final spell then the spell is still cast,  but  at
the casting level of this imaginary lower level wizard.
Because  spell  weaving  takes  a  lot  of  time,  spellweavers  always  lose
initiative. Also, the weavers cannot be separated by more than 10  feet,  and
no  barriers may be between any individual and the head caster. The number of
mages  involved is also limited: 11 for a master weaving. Minor weavers  only
count as   if included in master weaving, while major weavers count as  , for
the purpose of calculating the maximum number of mages.
Master  weaving  can take any 9th-level spell or lower to weave  successfully
(the desired spell can be of tenth level).

The  recipient  of this spell temporarily gains an extra proficiency  in  any
single  weapon  up to a double specialization. Note that the spell  may  also
enable  the  recipient to use an otherwise non-proficient weapon.  The  spell
lasts  for its duration or until another weapon is used by the recipient.  Up
to  three  of these spells may be stacked on a single weapon, transforming  a
non-proficiency into a double specialization. The material component  is  the
weapon in which the proficiency is to be gained, which must be touched by the
recipient of the spell and is not consumed in the casting.

This  spell  creates 8 types of attacks and hurls them into the target  area.
The  attack  forms  are:  cold, f electricity, acid, poison,  magic  missile,
energy drain, and physical blow. Any creature hit will be hit by 1 to 6 types
of  attack, and each attack does 1 HP per wizard level, maximum of 30 HP  per
type. Note that the creature can be immune to some attacks and not others.  A
successful saving throw reduces each type of damage taken by half.

In the casting of maze run, a wizard attempts to bestow upon the recipient  a
the  ability  to intuitively navigate the chaotic confines of any  maze.  The
recipient  must  save versus wand at a +3 bonus for the  spell  to  have  its
normal effect.
If  the saving throw is failed, the recipient becomes unable to keep track of
the  simplest spatial relationships, and is effectively lost for the duration
of the spell.
If  the  saving  throw is made the recipient becomes able  to  pick  his  way
through  any  form of maze with unerring accuracy, always choosing  the  most
direct,  safest path possible. The saving throw must have been  made  by  two
more  than  the required number for this effect to take place in  mazes  with
sliding or shifting walls, and must have been made by three or more to  apply
to  mazes with more than three dimensions. The recipient must make the saving
throw  by five or more to navigate mazes with more than three dimensions  and
sliding or shifting walls.
The  recipient  of  a successful maze run is immune to the  8th-level  wizard
spell  maze for the duration of the maze run. The material component of  maze
run is a hair from a living white rat.

With  this spell, the druid causes a path (which appears to be natural,  old,
man-made, etc.) to appear. Any who come across this path will believe  it  to
be  what it appears. To cast the spell, the druid needs two branches from  an
oak  tree. One is planted at the beginning of the path. The druid then  walks
the  route that he wishes the magical path to follow. At the end of the  path
the  other branch is planted and the spell is cast. Travel upon the  path  is
either  easy or hard (depending on the druid's choice of travel).  Those  who
happen  on the path must make a saving throw. Average the Hit Dice or  levels
of  the  group and roll one saving throw (the DM should do this  without  the
group's  knowledge).  If they fail, the path appears to  be  heading  in  the
direction that they wish to travel in. If the saving throw is made, the  path
appears  as  it is (i.e., a path in the direction that the druid walked)  and
the group may still decide to follow it anyway.
While  travelling  on  this  path, the group will never  surprise  anyone  or
anything  and  suffers a penalty of on all rolls (saving throws,  to-hit  and
damage  rolls, Dexterity checks, etc.). Those trying to leave the path  after
starting travelling on it find that the path is bordered by heavy thorns that
block  passage  and writhe and grasp all who enter (cf. wall  of  thorns  and
entangle).  This  wall attacks as the druid who cast the spell,  doing  1d6+2
points  of  damage.  Each 10-foot section of thorns has 3 attacks.  The  wall
arches over the path to prevent exit by flying, leaping, etc. The spell  also
counters the ability of pass without trace of other priests.
Fire  results in a double-strength wall of fire in the area (but it does  not
create  a  passable space, i.e., take fire damage and still  be  attacked  by
thorns).  The  only  way to leave the path is to follow it  to  its  end  (or
teleport  out, go ethereal, or plane shift). A dispel magic is possible  only
on the oak branches at the end of the path (either one).

With this spell, the wizard can create an extra-dimensional room (5-foot cube
per level) with one side adjacent to an unbroken 10x10 feet square (i.e., one
that  has no doors, windows, or other such openings). The surface area (which
must  be  touched) now acts as a phase door into the secluded room. The  room
can  be  of any shape and size up to the limit of the spell but at least  one
side must be at least a 10x10 feet area. Thus, the room could be rectangular,
pyramidal,  hemispherical, etc. The room lasts for 1 week per  level  of  the
wizard, or until dispelled.
The  wizard may bring any item, materials, etc. as he desires into the  room,
so  long as the object can fit through the phase door and is touched  by  the
wizard (and only by the wizard).
At  the end of the spell's duration, anyone or anything still within the room
is  now  trapped  in  that extradimensional space. escape  is  only  possible
through  other  extraplanar travel. This also occurs when a dispel  magic  or
similar magic is cast against the phase door area.
The  phase  door itself is detectable by any means available that can  detect
magical  auras, but the room itself can only be contacted through extraplanar
means.  Spells  such as clairvoyance and clairaudience will  not  detect  the
extraplanar  room but will instead detect whatever was on the other  side  of
the phase door surface.

The material component of this spell is a miniature hollow golden cube of  at
least two inches.

This spell allows the caster to borrow all the natural abilities of an undead
creature  sampled  by  the  components. This is why  you'd  see  necromancers
packing  skeletal shards all the time. Vampire hands and mummy hands are  the
most  popular. The caster does not suffer from undead limitations. Attempting
to make this spell permanent only works 30% of the time, the other 70% of the
time,  it will transform the caster into said undead (so be smart and  use  a
lich  hand if you're feeling lucky). The material component of this spell  is
an undead's hand.

Using this spell, the caster can meld into his natural surroundings and  thus
making himself invisible to other creatures. In order to cast the spell there
must  be  a sufficient amount of the appropriate element available:  rock  or
other similar material for the earth priest, a fair-sized fire, a water  pool
or  air for the air priest. Druids can use the element they have major access
to  and templars can use any element. The elemental material can be as far as
30 yards away from the caster at the time of the casting.
If  the  caster  melds  into earth, fire or water, he makes  himself  totally
invisible for the duration of the spell. He can be detected by magical  means
such as detect invisibility or true seeing, though. If he melds into air,  he
does  not  go invisible but rather transforms into an easily detected  aerial
form (clearly visible outline, blurs surroundings, lifts small items, etc.).
When  inside  the  elemental material, the caster can  see,  hear  and  smell
everything  in  range. He can even cast spells, although verbal communication
with  other  beings is not possible. The caster can make any spells  cast  to
appear  coming from any point within a 30-yard radius from him, thus avoiding
being detected by careful watchers.
The  elemental  material can be harmed normally, such as  chopping  rocks  to
pieces,  extinguishing fires or draining water pools. If the caster melds  in
the  air,  any attack against the aerial form causes normal damage (remember,
it  is  very easy to detect this form). This spell was designed for the  Dark
Sun campaign world.

This  is the ultimate suicide system. I guess many others may have their  own
version  of megablast. The idea is that in a desperate situation, the  caster
bursts  out  all his energy in a ball of pure energy causing 1d6  of  magical
damage  per spell levels remaining in the caster's memory (plus 9d6  for  the
megablast itself). Magic resistance reduces damage again by half (shock  wave
remains).  The  caster  himself has a 50% chance of  being  disintegrated  (a
saving  throw  applies, if the saving throw is made, he  still  receives  all
damages  as  above),  and a 50% chance of ending naked  on  another,  random,
plane.

The material component is a platinum dagger the wizard uses for suicide (good
idea, ending up naked but with a platinum knife somewhere in the abyss).  The
dagger is obviously not consumed in the casting.

This  spell enables the caster to memorise the next song he hears. From  then
on,  the  caster can sing and play the song exactly as he heard  it,  without
worrying about forgetting verses or notes later on in life.
This is especially useful for travelling minstrels, who must remember someone
else'  songs  for a long time in order to sing them (in other words,  "spread
the news") in faraway lands.

By means of this power a Psionicist can effectively bypass another
person's   natural   defense's.  (including  another   psionicst's
defenses)  Many DMs out there believe that if someone  psionically
touched  they  will  know it (especially in the  case  of  another
psionicists),  with  this  power  this  is  not  the  case.    The
psionicist will implant a thought into another person's mind  this
thought  will  be a front and he will follow it into the  person's
mind.   The  person  will  notice the thought  and  not  the  mind
touching  (on  a successful power check).  This is  a  very  risky
proposition (checks must be made by the DM every other round), but
the benefits are enormous the psionicist can roam around as if  he
were using a probe.  The probe that is used here though is not the
same because the psionicist can not make his presence known (where
when normally using probe he tries to batter down any defenses) he
can  only find the answer to one simple question every other round
(and  longer if a complex question up to the DM). He will not know
if  he has attracted the attention of the person's mind that he is
in, unless he finds resistance but until then he will have no idea
if  he has been found out.  The person who's mind has been entered
will  know  if that his mind has been entered when the  psionicist
fails  a  power check and at that time can try to use any defenses
he can use or get.  The preparation time must be spent finding out
about  the  person that the power will be used on.  He  must  find
some thought that he can use to follow in to the mind with. (ie  A
gladiator  learning  to use a sword, an elf  finally  earning  his
name, a halfling eating a person for the first time, etc.)

Power Score:  The psionicist only has to make a check every fourth
round.

20:   Automatic Failure the person knows your there and  can  take
whatever  precautions he can to stop your entry into his  mind  or
stop you from going further into his mind.

With  this  spell the caster may mend a broken bone. The bone must  still  be
made  of  living  tissue and recently broken. An hour must be spent  chanting
over  the  person, while smooth strokes are made on the skin over the  broken
bone. Water (or a similar substance depending on the view of the priest) must
be  rubbed over the wound every ten minutes. Over the course of the hour, the
bone will draw together and mend. It will be as good as new when the spell is
complete. If interrupted while casting, the bone will be mended only  partly,
depending  on when the caster was interrupted. The mending heals 10%  of  the
bone  for every 10 minutes of casting, and 50% of the mending occurs  in  the
last 10 minutes.
The  reverse of this spell, break bone, is an excruciating process, where the
bone  is weakened and drawn apart until it is split into two separate pieces.
The process still occurs over the course of an hour and a saving throw versus
spell occurs in the last 10 minutes. If successful, the bone is only weakened
by  50%;  if failed, the bone is separated completely. It is a common torture
technique among Dark Sun templars.
Note: in order to insure that the bone is set properly the caster must make a
successful healing proficiency check, when the spell is completed. If someone
other  than  the caster tries to use the healing proficiency  and  guide  the
caster  he must make the check at an additional  5 to his roll. An improperly
set bone must be broken and set again in order to attain its former strength.

Mental  Dagger  is  a sharp, pointed attack against  the  victim's
mind.  It's  one of the new telepathic attacks used  to  establish
contact  with another Psionicist.  If the power is used against  a
already  contacted mind, it opens a mental wound where  the  life-
force  is sipping out. The victim suffers a loss of 1 HP per round
thereafter,  beginning  with the round of  first  use.  When  used
again, the loss is increased by 1 HP per round to a maximum  of  3
HP/round.    The  wound  closes  when  the  victim   is   rendered
unconscious, is psychic surged, or gains the benefits of any  cure
spell  ore power. If the rules for 'Death's Door' are in use,  the
bleeding stops at 0 HP, else is stops at 1 HP and the victim falls
unconscious.

Power Score:  The loss is 2 HP/round, the maximum is increased  by
1.

20:  The psionicist suffers the wound by himself.

This  spell causes the priest to give a special "oomph!" to any single action
he  is  performing, regardless of its nature. In combat (magical,  melee,  or
missile),  it has the affect of either increasing the damage done,  duration,
area  of  effect,  or  something else of any spell or  attack.  Whatever  the
situation,  however,  its  effects  can only  be  felt  for  a  short  (often
instantaneous) duration. It cannot be used to help the priest go several days
without sleep, but it might allow the priest to double his maximum pace for a
round.  Occasionally, the spell backfires, causing some sort of  catastrophic
fumble.  In  order  to  determine the general effect of  the  spell,  the  DM
secretly rolls 1d20, and consults the following table:

     D20 Roll  Result    In game terms
     1    Oops...   Catastrophic Fumble
     2    Uh oh...  Normal Fumble
     3    Dud...    No effect

This  spell enables the wizard to record spells in an unused portion  of  his
brain, just as if it was recorded in a spellbook. The wizard can record three
spell  levels  for each level of experience. This will enable the  wizard  to
memorise spells as if the wizard were reading the spells from a spellbook.
If  the wizard wishes to change the spells memorised therein, then the wizard
must  recast  mental ledger to change the contents. The casting time  of  the
spell is one hour per spell level to be memorised.

The material components of this spell is a slate of pure quality lead crystal
of no less than 5000 gp value which disappears after the spell is cast.

This  spell  is  similar to mental ledger in that it enables  the  wizard  to
record  information in some unused portion of the wizard's  brain,  and  then
gives  the wizard the ability to read the information at a later date  as  if
they were reading it in their own hands.
This  spell actually will allow the wizard to hold as many spells as he knows
and  any that the wizard might learn in the future. In fact, any spells  that
are  stored  in the wizard's brain through the use of the spell  will  remain
there  essentially  forever available for recall when necessary.  This  spell
also  allows  the  wizard to record information other  than  spells  in  this
"storage area". The wizard can store the entire contents of any book that  he
reads  and  can  access the book at any time in the future just  like  mental
note.  To  add  more  information after the spell is cast requires  that  the
wizard  cast  the  spell  again  at the time  that  they  wish  to  add  more
information.

The  material  components for this spell, the first time it is  cast,  are  a
specially  prepared lead crystal which has been enchanted to  absorb  magical
energies. The value of this item can be no less than 50,000 gp. To  add  more
information  in  subsequent castings, the wizard would require  a  pure  lead
crystal of 5000 gp (as in mental ledger).
This  spell is highly useful for wizards on the go who want all their  spells
and library without having to carry it around for themselves.
The casting time depends on what is being stored. It takes one hour per spell
level per spell memorised, and it takes the time it takes the wizard to  read
a  book to store a book (the wizard is allowed to take short breaks and sleep
if there is a large amount of information being memorised).

     This spell allows the wizard to store information in the unused portions
of  his brain for later recall. The information thus stored will be available
for complete recall as if the wizard was reading the ifrom a parchment in his
hands.

      The wizard is able to store up to two pages of information in the brain
through the use of this spell. If at a later time, the wizard wishes  to  add
more  information, or change the information that is current  in  his  brain,
then  the  wizard  will  be required to recast the  spell  and  memorise  the
information again. There can only be one spell active in the wizards brain at
anyone time.

The  material component of this spell is a lead crystal sheet of no less than
50 gp value which disappears after the spell is cast.

This  spell brings into being a microscopic quantity of anti-matter  wherever
the wizard decides within range. The anti-matter will detonate instantly with
whatever  matter happens to be there, doing considerable damage to creatures,
depending  on  the  range  from the blast. If it materializes  in  a  vacuum,
embedded  in  a  force  field,  or  other place  without  matter,  the  spell
dissipates.  The  major  effect is to cause a fireball-like  blast  affecting
things  within 20 yards of ground zero, causing 1d6 points per level  of  the
wizard, up to a maximum of 12d6, with a saving throw for half damage. Targets
immune  to fire or normal physical attacks take only half of the result,  and
targets immune to both take none.
The  spell  will  also  affect creatures made of living  tissue  as  follows,
depending on the distance from the centre of the blast:
           Centre up to 20 yards: the creature will die of radiation sickness
in  2d6 days unless a cure disease spell is cast on it or unless it is immune
to  disease,  and  it will be permanently blinded (until  cured),  its  optic
nerves having been destroyed.
           20  to  40 yards: unless immune to disease, the creature  will  be
afflicted  with radiation sickness that will cause it to die in 1d3+1  weeks.
Furthermore, it will be blinded for a period of one week.
           40 to 60 yards: one hour later, the creature will become violently
ill  with  radiation  sickness, with an effective -2  each  to  Constitution,
Dexterity, and Strength, until a month passes or it rests for half a day  per
level  of  the wizard. Blindness also occurs, lasting 1d6 days. The penalties
for radiation sickness also apply to terminally ill creatures at less than 40
yards.
           60  to  80  yards: the creature will become mildly  ill  (no  game
effect), and will be blinded for one day.
The  target must make a separate saving throw for radiation and for blindness
damage, and if it succeeds it keeps making saving throws until it fails. Each
success  reduces the effect to that of one level farther out.  The  radiation
passes  through solid objects, but each 6 inches of stone or  yard  of  water
reduces  the effect to the next outwards level. A sufficiently wide  barrier,
such as a wall, will eliminate the blindness entirely.
Creatures  not made of flesh, like xorns, but that still see using eyes,  are
affected  by  the  blindness only, not by the radiation.  Creatures  such  as
elementals or golems are unaffected by either. Undead and creatures from  the
lower  planes are not blinded by the light, but take extra damage from it  of
3d6,  2d6,  1d6,  or nothing depending on their distance from  the  targeting
point of the spell.
The  wizard  can optionally materialize the anti-matter inside a creature  or
thing.  A creature gets a saving throw versus petrification, and an object  a
saving  throw versus crushing blow. If it fails, it takes double damage,  but
all others automatically make the saving throw for half damage and one saving
throw  against  the  radiation.  This version works  only  against  corporeal
creatures.  Against fortifications, the spell does one structural  point  per
level if materialized inside, half damage otherwise.

The material component of the spell is a mushroom.

This  spell  allows 1d3 + 1 per 2 levels of the caster number  of  people  to
merge with the person who was touched. People merged are similar in a way  to
gaseous  form  or wraithform. They cannot be harmed, though the recipient  of
the  spell can. Even magically held, paralysed, charmed, etc., recipients  in
no  way  hamper the people merged. If the people merged are forced out,  then
roll on the following table:

     D100 Roll Result
      01-50      Propelled out. Confused for 1 round, "holder"  system  shock
roll or 1d3 HP
     51-75     No adverse effects
     76-97     All lose 1d4 HP and are dazed for 2 rounds
     98-99     1d100% of merged people are stuck
     100  All go insane

The  merged  people are forced out if the spell expires, a  dispel  magic  is
successfully cast on the recipient, or the recipient dies.
Stuck people must make a system shock roll every round or go insane. Note: in
all  cases of people being stuck, the brain of the recipient fries.  Material
component is a drop of glue.

This  spell  allows  a  wizard to merge two or more  functions  of  items  or
creatures  together. These functions of items or features  of  creatures  are
chosen by the caster. There are two different rituals: one for items and  one
for creatures.
For items the caster has to create an area of the highest magic potential (an
area of spells with no less than 10 permanent spells of level 5 or higher per
function to be merged). This area is completely drained in a casting  whether
successful  or not. In this ritual the caster has to prepare the items  which
are  to  be  merged into one plus the item into which they are to be  merged.
This  preparation includes a full enchant an item spell for each item  to  be
merged.  The item into which the others are to be merged has to be  worth  no
less than double the sum of all the other items. Then this new item is placed
in  the  centre  of  a  thaumaturgic  circle  with  the  other  items  placed
equidistant on the outer edge.
Then  the  ritual of merging can begin. After a casting time of 8  hours  for
each  function  to  be merged the caster begins to draw the  magic  from  the
surrounding items and transferring it to the central item. This takes another
8  hours per function. Once he begins to transfer the powers he must  not  be
disturbed;  otherwise the spell fails as described below. Even if  the  items
are moved (even by an earth quake), the spell fails as described below. After
the  powers are transferred the caster needs another 8 hours per function  to
seal  off the powers from each other and into the new item. During this  time
he  may  be  disturbed  again but not for longer than  24  hours  in  a  row,
otherwise the spell fails again. For each power the wizard transfers  he  has
to make a saving throw versus spell. If any of these saving throws fails, the
spell  fails.  If  all  saving  throws succeed the  powers  are  successfully
transferred.  Then,  only  a  single permanency  spell  has  to  be  cast  to
permanently seal the powers.
For creatures to be merged, they have to be of the same general class: living
biped with living biped, undead quadruped with undead quadruped, etc. Then  a
similar  ritual  as  with  items is necessary. In  this  case  they  have  to
enchanted  with  one fire charm each and they all have to fail  their  saving
throws against this spell. The fire charm has to work through out the ritual,
but  once  they  have failed one saving throw are not allowed another  saving
throw  until  the  ritual comes to an end. At the end  of  the  function  (or
feature)  transfer each creature has to make a saving throw versus spell.  If
any  of these saving throws succeed the creature retains its features and the
central  creature suffers the effects of a failed spell. The caster also  has
to  make  a  saving throw for every function he transfers. If  any  of  these
saving throws fails, the whole spell fails (see below).
If  the spell fails for any reason, any items of less than artifact level are
destroyed instantly in an explosion of raw magic (like spellfire).  There  is
no  known  protection  against  this  spellfire.  The  explosion  incinerates
anything within 100 feet per item or creature that was to be merged. This  is
absolutely  deadly: no one can survive this (not with magic  resistance,  not
with a scarab of protection, not with fire resistance: nothing helps), except
for  gods.  The only thing that survives is an unwilling creature that  makes
its  saving  throw versus death magic in the transfer. Thus,  this  spell  is
rarely used for unwilling creatures to be transferred.
The  effect of this spell is to drain the creature or item of its own  powers
(and  deficiencies,  if  desired) and transferring  them  completely  to  the
central  item or creature. A creature thereafter does not have its normal  or
natural  powers. If the life is drained from one creature and  placed  within
another,  that  central creature is given the normal life expectancy  of  the
original  creature and the original is rendered lifeless (dead).  Thus,  this
spell  is  a  cause  for  an alignment check if used by  good  characters  on
unwilling creatures (and charmed creatures are not naturally willing).
It  is  not possible to merge an already merged item or creature with another
item  or creature (whether that other item or creature was merged or unmerged
before  does  not matter). In the ritual the caster chooses the functions  of
the  items  he  wishes  to transfer into the central item  or  creature.  The
offspring of such merged creatures has a 10% chance to inherit each function,
but  there is also a 10% chance per function that the offspring will die from
the effects.
It  is not possible to destroy an artifact with this spell, no matter what is
done  to it. It will normally be moved to another plane (normally along  with
the caster) where the caster will have to contend with the (angry) creator of
the artifact.

The material components for this spell are: a single king's tear (a very rare
gem  found  in  the  Forgotten Realms only) for every five  functions  to  be
transferred, plus a full gallon of nitric acid for each item which is used to
dissolve a part of the items or creature to be merged, plus the rendition  of
the  thaumaturgic circle in a setting of a complete platinum floor ringed  in
gems (no less than 10 diamonds, rubies, emeralds, topazes, and sapphires each
of  no  less than 5000 gp each) which costs no less than 500,000 gp  for  the
whole  circle, plus a freely donated horn of a unicorn which acts as a funnel
for  the magic into the central item or creature. With the exception  of  the
last  item every other material component is completely and utterly destroyed
in the casting whether successful or not. How to get the material components,
well... that's your problem, isn't it?
Note:  this spell can be very dangerous for playing balance if the characters
can  use  it with ease. Thus, the DM should think about some rioting  mob  to
break  into  the  tower  of the wizard during some  critical  part  of  spell
casting.  And think about those incredibly long casting times... As a  normal
wizard  can only cast for a continual 10 to 12 hours a day, the casting  time
lengthens  again  quite considerably. Thus, to transfer the  powers  of  four
items  with three functions each into one item would take a casting  time  of
16x24  =  384 hours. These hours would have to be split up into some  shorter
periods for most wizards, thus forcing the wizard to retreat for a full 32 to
38  days  (plus the preparation time for those items) for those wimpy sixteen
functions. Quite long enough for most opposing wizards to find out  about  it
and setting up a little "welcome-to-the-netherworld party" for the character.

This spell causes music emanating from a musical instrument to become twisted
and  harsh.  The  musical notes effectively become interchanged.  The  target
instrument  may  be  either magical or non-magical. Only magical  instruments
gain  a saving throw (as if the attack were magical fire) to avoid the  spell
effects.  If  a  bard is playing an affected instrument, all  bard  abilities
directly  resulting  from the playing of his instrument are  lost  until  the
spell expires (or the bard uses a new instrument). The spell has no effect on
sounds   from   living  creatures,  although  it  could  effectively   garble
communication through instruments (i.e., signalling drums). It only works  on
items  which are emitting music at any time while (or up to one round  after)
the spell is being cast.
The  origins and history of the spell Merkridan's misplayal are unknown. This
spell  was discovered in a lost laboratory complex on the deserted island  of
Arremara.

This  spell was developed by Merlin, probably with the assistance of Leomund.
The  spell creates a bubble with a diameter of 10 yards. The caster  and  all
those  friendly  to  him can enter this bubble and use  it  as  a  method  of
transport  in hostile climate (movement rate 20 yards per round). The  bubble
is  impenetrable by the elements, hostile creatures, and weapons of less then
a  +4  magical bonus. Inside the bubble the interior climate remains  exactly
the  same as when the caster created it. There always is enough air  for  the
spell's  duration. This spell can travel safely into all terrains,  including
extraplanar ones. The material component is a bit of soapy water,  which  the
caster must blow a bubble with.

      The  spell  causes the caster's arm to become equivalent  to  a  medium

This  spell  causes  metals to transform into another metal.  The  change  is
permanent  and completely irreversible except by another spell of this  kind.
The  following table shows which metals can be affected and into which metals
they could be changed at which level of the caster:

     Wizard's
     Level     Metals affected
     9-11 soft metals (but not gold) into iron and vice versa
     12-13     iron to steel and vice versa
     14-15     steel to mithril
     16-17     mithril to adamantine
     18+  adamantine to hizagkuur or black iron, as in an Ironstar mace

The  last  entry is placed so high due to the fact that hizagkuur  metal  has
highly  anti-magical properties (see Dwarves Deep), and it has to be  changed
in  a  red  or white hstate so it will be affected by it. Black  iron  is  an
invention  of the Ironstar clan and is a very rare (and now not so  rare  any
more) metal normally found only in the possession of the Ironstar clan.
If  the  item  to  be transformed is a magical item it gains a  saving  throw
versus  spell as its creator. If this succeeds, the caster suffers a backlash
of  1d10  hit  points of damage per level which is required to transform  the
metal, but the item is not transformed. If it fails, the caster still suffers
damage, but the item is transformed. The caster does not gain a saving  throw
to reduce the damage.
The casting time is one round per pound of metal per level required to change
it, so a caster trying to change mithril to adamantine would have to cast  16
rounds  per  pound  to  be  changed.  The  transformations  above  cannot  be
compressed  into one change. Thus, to change iron into hizagkuur,  one  would
have  to transform the metal four times (and try to heat adamantine until  it
is red hot - you would probably need dragon breath).

The  material component is a tiny bit (about a nail size) of the metal to  be
affected and another bit of the type it is to be changed into.

The  caster  can transform some material of one element into a different  but
related material of the same element. The transformation is permanent for air
or water and lasts for one turn per level for earth.
           The air priest can metamorphose gases and vapours in containers or
the air around him into other gases (one 5 foot-cube per level).
           Earth  priests can transform stone, gems, etc., into other earthly
materials.  He can, for example, transform granite into obsidian.  He  cannot
affect metal at all. He can also turn stone into dust and vice versa (1 pound
per  level).  To make the change permanent, the earth priest must  prepare  a
special  gem, costing at least 50 gp, using the spells bless and stone  shape
on it.
          The water priest is able to turn a liquid of one type into another.
Water can be made poisonous, for example, or the reverse could be done (up to
one  gallon per level). Note that the priest must know both substances before
casting the spell. A water priest, for example, cannot turn an unknown liquid
into pure water; he must know what the liquid is in order to use this spell.
The  material  component is a small amount of the target material.  If  water
must  be turned to poison, some of the desired poison must be at hand.  If  a
gas  is  to be turned into steam, a container with steam must exist.  To  use
this spell, one must have at least minor access to the related sphere (i.e. a
templar  can change all elements). This spell was designed for the  Dark  Sun
campaign world.

This  spell  creates a disembodied hand similar to those of the Bigby's  hand
spells, except it is much smaller (about the size of an ogre's hand). It will
attack as directed by the wizard (no concentration is required to do so - the
wizard  simply chooses the target). The hand does not automatically hit,  but
will attack using the wizard's THAC0, with a +2 to-hit bonus.
If  a  hit is scored, the fist closes tightly around the victim's throat;  it
will  continue  squeezing until the target is dead,  or  until  the  hold  is
broken.  Once per round, the fist's lock may be broken by making a successful
bend bars roll (the victim has a 10% penalty applied to this roll); only  one
person may do this each round, due to the small size of the hand. Other party
members who try to free the victim must devote their entire attention to this
for the round (i.e. no other action may be taken, Dexterity bonuses to Armour
Class are lost, etc.).
Each round the victim is choked, a system shock roll must be made; each round
of constriction after the first imposes a cumulative 5% penalty to this roll.
If  the roll fails, the victim fall unconscious and if the hold is not broken
the  following round, the victim dies. While a victim is being choked he  may
perform  no  other actions (other than breaking the fist's hold)  -  all  the
target's  efforts are required to fight the effects of the constriction.  The
fist will continue attacking until it is destroyed or dispelled, or until the
spell's  duration expires; the wizard can also end the spell  with  a  single
word.
The  fist may be destroyed by direct attack; it has an Armour Class of 2  and
as many hit points as the wizard at full health. The fist will also break its
hold  on  a  victim every time it loses half its remaining hit  points.  Note
however,  that attacking the fist while it is choking a victim is  dangerous;
if  an  attack  on  the  fist fails to hit, another  normal  attack  must  be
immediately rolled against the victim, inflicting any damage normally. If the
fist's hold is released or broken, it may be attacked without fear of hitting
companions. If the fist is not choking a victim, it may be attacked by anyone
who  beats the wizard's initiative roll (or by anyone, if the fist  fails  to
score a hit that round).

The  material components for this spell are a bit of bone and skin  from  any
constricting snake; these components are consumed when the spell is cast.

When this spell is cast, a 5-foot wide, electrically-charged, blue ray shoots
from  the  wizard's finger, and strikes as directed up to a  distance  of  10
yards  per  level of the wizard. The ray travels in a straight  line  and  is
blocked  by  most  obstacles; however, it will burn through  thin,  flammable
material such as cloth and straw.
When the ray reaches its terminal point, as chosen by the wizard (or when  it
strikes a blocking obstacle) it will erupt into a lightning swarm. This swarm
appears  as  a  glowing,  blue sphere with dozens of  small  lightning  bolts
flashing  in all directions. The radius of the swarm is 5 feet per  level  of
the wizard.
Anyone  caught inside the swarm suffers 10d6 points of damage;  a  successful
saving throw versus spell reduces this damage by half (victims wearing  metal
armour  suffer  a  -2 penalty to their saving throw). Those  who  fail  their
saving throw must make a saving throw versus lightning for all their objects;
items that fail their saving throw are destroyed.
If the wizard desires, the swarm may be continued for a second round. If full
concentration imaintained, the wizard may move the swarm 10 feet per level of
the wizard; if the wizard's concentration is broken, the swarm stays where it
is.  Anyone  that comes into contact with the swarm during the  second  round
suffers 5d6 points of damage. Those who successfully saved on the first round
automatically save on the second round as well.

The material component for this spell is the heart of a blue dragon, which is
consumed when the spell is cast. Evil wizards have discovered that the  heart
of a bronze dragon will also work as a material component for this spell.

This  spell  can  be  cast  by the wizard upon one  person,  not  necessarily
himself. While in effect, the area within 10 feet of the recipient becomes  a
scrying  "dead  area". When a scrying device (such as a  magic  mirror  or  a
crystal ball) is directed at the area, all that will be seen in the dead area
is  grey  mist.  The information gathering spells detect lie, locate  object,
clairaudience,  clairvoyance, know alignment, and any  "detect"  spells  will
return  no  information (which in itself will be quite peculiar).  F  when  a
priest  casts  a  commune spell and asks a question regarding  events  taking
place  within  the dead area, the DM must make a secret saving  throw  versus
death magic for each question asked by said priest, and a wrong answer should
be given when the saving throw is failed.
Note  that anyone can see into the area just fine, and no physical protection
is given. The spell simply counters detection magic.

The  material  component for this spell is a finely crafted ball  of  layered
onyx,  gold, and lead. Such a ball costs 3000 gp, takes a month to make,  and
disappears upon casting.

This  spell  surrounds  the caster with strokes of  lightning.  Everyone  who
attacks  the  wizard with a metal or natural weapon, or is  attacked  by  the
wizard,  instantly receives 1d4 points of damage +1 point per  level  of  the
caster.
The  spell also makes the wizard almost invulnerable to all electricity based
attack  forms. However, there is a 10% chance plus or minus 2% per  level  of
difference  between  attacker  and  the wizard,  that  such  an  attack  will
penetrate the cloak, in which case the spell will discharge upon the  caster.
When this happens, the caster receives normal damage plus the damage from the
original  electrical attack, i.e. 1d4 +1 per level plus the damage from  that
lightning  bolt.  During the spell's duration, all electricity  based  spells
cast by wizard will systematically fail. The material components are a bit of
fur and an amber, crystal or glass rod.

This  spell is similar to magic missile, except that it uses positive  energy
instead  of normal magical energy. As many missiles are created as  in  magic
missile.  Normal living creatures do not suffer damage from these bolts,  but
must  roll  a saving throw versus paralysation or be stunned and blinded  for
1d4  rounds. Undead and creatures from the lower planes struck by this  spell
take 2d4+2 points of damage per bolt. The material component of this spell is
a platinum needle tipped with a diamond (together worth at least 150 gp).

The  caster  is  surrounded by an aura of goodness and his clothes  start  to
radiate  light  equal in brightness to a light spell. All evil beings  attack
the caster at -2 to-hit and to damage, and the caster receives a +2 bonus  to
saving throws versus attacks made by these creatures. No evil creature  under
8  HD which fails its saving throw versus spell dares to enter melee with the
caster.
The  reverse of this spell, Mikkis' unholiness, affects all beings  who  view
the caster. He is surrounded by a feeling of ultimate evil and sheds darkness
around him.

The material components of this spell are white clothes and a crushed diamond
of  at least 100 gp value, or black clothes and a black pearl for the reverse
of the spell.

This spell summons a servant from elemental plane of air. This servant can be
ordered to carry items for caster, force open doors, bend bars or lift  heavy
items.  To determine the changes of success and weight allowance, the servant
is  considered to have Strength 18/01, which is improved by one category  per
level beyond 9th.
The  servant  is  invisible and can only be hit by weapons of  +1  or  better
enchantment.  It has AC 0 and 3d8 HP + 1 point per level of the  caster.  All
saving  throws  are equal to those of the caster. The servant  isn't  a  true
creature,  but  merely  a  form  of elemental  power  of  air,  summoned  and
controlled  by  the caster. Therefore, it cannot be used to attack  anything.
The porter has movement rate of 24.

The  material component of this spell is a burning incense and short bent bar
of iron.

This  spell determines where and exactly how a specific spell hits  a  single
target. With this information the caster gets several benefits when he  casts
the same spell on the same target again.
If  the spell requires a to-hit roll, each successful casting makes the  next
casting easier to hit by cumulative 1% per level of the caster. If spell does
damage, after each successful hit, the next hit will cause cumulative 1%  per
level  of  the  caster of extra damage. The target's saving  throw  for  half
damage  will also be penalized by cumulative 1% per level of the  caster.  If
the  target has magic resistance, each successful casting will lower it by  a
cumulative 1% per level of the caster.

By  means  of this spell, the caster is able to see the tracks of  a  desired
creature. Even the tracks of flying creature, a druid or a person using  pass
without  trace can be followed. The caster cannot, however, follow  very  old
tracks.  Normal tracks, older than 1 day + 1 hour per level, and tracks  made
by  flying  creatures, druids, or creatures using pass without  trace,  older
than  1  turn  per level, cannot be tracked. The spell will also  reveal  the
approximate speed of the creatures followed.

This  spell  creates a magical cloud above the desired  It  will  follow  the
target  at  speed of 24 and rain acid upon it causing 4d4+4 points of  damage
per  round. The victim is allowed saving throw versus spell every round  and,
if this is successful, he takes only half damage that round.
The spell can be negated by dispel magic, or by an ice storm or similar spell
which freezes the cloud. A very strong wind can lead the cloud away from  the
target. The material component of this spell is a spoonful of acid.

To  be  able  to  cast  this spell, the "victim" must be  frozen,  eg.  by  a
successful  hold  person. The caster must then place a piece  of  mithril  in
front  of him, one behind of him, and one on both sides. A diamond must  then
be drawn between these mithril pieces, without touching the mithril once they
have  been placed. The wizard then casts the spell. No to-hit roll is needed,
because the victim is frozen. An Intelligence check must be made, though.  If
successful,  the  victim assumes the form of a small mithril  miniature.  The
mithril pieces are used up in the spell. If the miniature is sold, stolen, or
possessed by anyone other than the caster, the spell is broken and the victim
enlarges at a very fast rate, and the mithril pieces reappear - end of story.
If  the caster dies, the victim is freed as well. If the victim comes out  of
the hold person spell before this spell is completed, the casting failed.  If
the miniature is destroyed, broken, or melted, the victim dies.

This  spell  forces some humanoid creature in the wizard's line of  sight  to
begin  mimicking  his actions. The creature's actions will  directly  reflect
those of the wizard, regardless of position or orientation. The creature will
be  frozen  momentarily at the onset of the spell, but after that  moment  of
inaction, the creature begins mimicking the wizard.
This can be potentially harmful for the target, if, say, the wizard waves his
hand  in  the vicinity of his neck, and the target happens to be  wielding  a
sword.
Once the spell is cast, the wizard need not be able to see the target for the
target  to  mimic his actions. The target does get a second saving  throw  if
forced  to  do  actions that are obviously lethal, such as the aforementioned
hand  waving example. If the target passes outside of the range of the spell,
the spell is broken.

The  material  component  of the spell is a small ivory  figurine,  which  is
broken to bits in the casting of the spell.

The  mimic  devotion  will  allow the psi  to  perform  briefly  a
physical  feat  that would not otherwise be possible.   The  mimic
devotion has two phases in its function. The first phase is called
the  scan phase, wherein the devotion is activated while  the  psi
witnesses  some sort of brief physical act that he/she  would  not
normally be able to accomplish. This scan phase allows the psi  to
psychically  monitor the physical functioning of another  humanoid
and  record in his/her subconscious the results of the  scan.  The
scan measures such sundries as neuromuscular activity, heart rate,
brain waves and whatever else. The memory of the event is held  in
the  psi's  mind  until it is activated at the  will  of  the  psi
(calling for another successful power roll). Successful activation
wipes  the  memory of the specific event scan. If the roll  fails,
the  memory  remains but is not activated on  this  attempt.   The
maximum  number of memories allowed to be held at any one time  is
equal to the psi's current level.
      Upon  activation,  the  psi brings his/her  awesome  psionic
energies to bear, allowing him/her to duplicate the feat(and  lose
ten  PSPs). The feat must be a single task such as bending a steel
bar,  firing an arrow, tumbling from a great height safely to  the
ground, throwing a boulder, etc. Personally I would even allow the
duplication  of  some  spell effects, such as  jump,  although  if
"detect  magic"  is  used  on the psi while  performing,  none  is
detected!  Examples:
      Jack the psi witnesses Wondru the magnificent (names changed
to  protect the guilty) bend a steel bar. He scans the event,  and
if the power roll is successful, the memory is stored (he has also
lost  10  PSPs).  He then boldly strides up to the  bar,  makes  a
successful  power role, and now has a chance equal to Wondru's  to
bend the bar, even though his strength is actually 10.
      Jack  then sees Lachief, Ranger extraordinaire, fire a  bow.
Jack   scans   it  and  then  confidently  picks   up   the   bow.
Unfortunately, his power roll fails and he almost shoots  himself,
as  he  doesn't have any bow proficiency at all.  If he  made  it,
though,  he  would have been able to fire it once using  Lachief's
THAC0 (WITH Lachief's dex, elf, and prof bonuses and all).

Power Score:  The event activates and is still retained in memory

20:  The memory is lost without having benefited the psi.

This  spell  is  similar to the 1st-level wizard spell minor mimicry  (q.v.).
However, the spell continues even after a form is dispelled by movement,  and
once  the spell recipient again becomes stationary, he can be concealed by  a
new  form  (again chosen by the wizard). Therefore, the only ways  the  spell
would  end are an end to the wizard's concentration, or the spell's recipient
passing  beyond  a 10-yard range per level. If the wizard's concentration  is
ended, any illusionary form will last 5 rounds + 1 round per level.

This is an extremely powerful version of true seeing combined with a form  of
clairvoyance. Like true seeing, it allows the wizard to exactly locate people
that are displaced, invisible, polymorphed, changed, enchanted, or masked  by
an illusion. However, the spell affects the mind, not the eyes of the wizard,
so  the wizard can, in addition, see through fog, around corners, trees, etc.
(anything within the 100-foot radius).
About the only things that will block the penetration power of the spell  are
non-detection (the recipient of a non-detection gets a saving throw to see if
the  mind find worked), lead walls, or walls of force. The spell also confers
the  ability to perceive minds in any direction, including up or down.  Thus,
the wizard could locate the mind of someone 80 feet above him and behind him.
Needless to say that backstabbing someone who knows exactly where you are  is
impossible.
However,  this spell cannot locate objects or things without minds,  thus  it
could  not locate anything that had less than zero Intelligence. The drawback
to  this spell is that it makes the wizard more susceptible to mind-affecting
spells: save at -2.

The material component of this spell is a whole mind flayer brain.

This  acts much like a domination.  It, when the psionicist places
a  hand  on  the victim, grabs hold of the  opponents  psyche  and
forces  it  into  a  sort of holding cell..thus  the  opponent  is
totally  immobile  during  the time of usage,  as  well  as  under
complete  physical control.  Thoughts can occur, but  no  form  of
telepathy can occur.  Also thinking becomes slowed, as the  energy
holding  the mind takes a lot of effort to overcome.  Spellcasting
becomes  impossible while under the influence of this power.   All
Intelligence and Wisdom checks are at -3.

Power Score:  The psionicist badly batters the mind of the victim.
The  victim suffers as if he is under the influence of this  power
for  1  day.   The  psionicist does not need to expend  points  to
maintain this

20:   The  Psionicist gains a severe migraine which  lasts  for  2
turns,  no  powers  may be used during this time.   As  well,  all
ability score checks are made at -2 due to the intense pain.   Any
loud noises REALLY hurt (anyone who has had a migraine can testify
to this)

Mind  Kill  is  a  forceful  overload of  the  victims  mind  with
psionically energy in form from contrary commands. It's one of the
new  telepaths  attacks  used to establish  contact  with  another
psionicist.   If  the power is used against an  already  contacted
mind,  it  literary squeezes the fluids out of the brain,  killing
the  victim instantly if he fails his save vs. death. Even  if  he
succeed  in  the save, he is rendered unconscious for  1d6  hours,
leaving him completely helpless.

     This cantrip is a weaker version of magic missile. Casting generates one
missile  plus  one per level. Each is sufficient to kill creatures  typically
affected  by an exterminate cantrip; i.e., those that normally have zero  hit
points.  Ten  mini missiles will inflict 1 point of damage if a saving  throw
versus spell is failed.

This  spell  turns its victim into an undead. The type of undead is  selected
randomly from those between the power of a wight and a vampire. The undead is
partially  controllable by the wizard. This is a risky  spell:  each  command
given  is a chance for the victim to become a fully free undead of the  type,
unless  the  wizard  also is a member of the same type of  undead.  The  thus
created undead is free-willed, but may still be subject to other spells  that
remove  this freedom, of course. The change takes place over a period of  two
weeks of gradually worsening illness in which time the spell can be dispelled
by  a dispel magic, cure disease, and heal, cast in any order any time during
the  two  weeks, not necessarily one straight after the other. The DM  should
make up some appropriate material component.
Note:  the spell can create some quite weird undead, such as vampire  snakes.
Controlling  requires a common language and sufficient  Intelligence  on  the
part  of  the target. The spell in itself doesn't modify statistics  such  as
intellect,  even if the undead Strength of 18/00 on a vampire does  apply  to
non-humanoids as well.

      This  spell creates the illusion (in both sound and feel) of a mosquito
flying  into the victim's ear. The victim will then act appropriately,  which
usually means stopping and trying to get the illusionary mosquito out of  his
ear,  until  either a successful saving throw versus spell is  made,  or  the
spell expires.

      The  spell  can be used to interrupt casting of a spell. It  will  also
increase  the  victim's chance of spell failure by 10% for  every  round  the
spell is effective after the first.

      The  victim gets a saving throw at the time of the casting, and at  the
end of each round thereafter. For every level the victim is above the caster,
it  gets  a +1 bonus on the saving throw. The illusionary mosquito  does  not
stop the victim from fighting, it does give it a -2 to-hit, however.

This  spell  enables the caster to assume a special "elemental  form"  for  a
limited period of time.
The  caster  becomes  a lesser elemental of his devoted element;  druids  can
become  elementals  of any sphere to which they have at least  minor  access;
templars  can  become any elemental. The transformation takes  place  in  one
round,  during which the caster can be attacked and hit automatically by  any
weapon.
When  in elemental form, the caster has the abilities of that elemental.  His
hit points, THAC0 and saving throws do not change, however. If a dispel magic
is  successfully cast upon him or he is caught in a defiler magic  area,  the
caster  will  return to his natural form and will die if he  fails  a  system
shock roll.
When  the  caster returns normally to his own form, he regains 1d12 HP.  This
spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This spell allows the caster to create a stationary wall composed of material
from  his  elemental plane of worship (templars may cast this  spell  in  any
form).  It  covers  a  20-foot-square area per level  (the  thickness  varies
depending on the element); this area may be arranged in any manner to form  a
rectangular  wall,  as  long as neither dimension falls  below  5  feet.  For
example, a 5th-level caster, who can create a wall up to 100 square  feet  in
area, might create a wall that is 5 feet high and 20 feet long or a wall that
is 20 feet high and 50 feel long.
While  this set of spells share common characteristics, such as duration  and
area  of  effect,  the  wall's  specific  properties  differ  based  on   its
composition.

     Element   Properties
      Air   Creates an invisible wall of violently disturbed air that is  two
feet thick. Treat as per wind wall (page 154, Player's Handbook).
      Water      Creates a wall of billowing fog that is up to 10 feet  thick
per  level  of  the  caster. Treat as per wall of  fog  (page  139,  Player's
Handbook).
     Fire Creates a two foot thick wall of hot air that causes targets viewed
through it to shimmer and waver. Treat as blur for all attacks made within or
through the wall (eg., ranged attacks; page 140, Player's Handbook).
      Earth      Creates a wall of swirling dust that is 10 feet  thick.  The
dust  obscures vision. Treat as  a blur spell for all attacks made within  or
through the wall (eg., ranged attacks; page 140, Player's Handbook).

The  material component is a bit of the element (air, water, fire, earth)  of
which the wall is composed.

      This spell allows the wizard to make the creature touched to appear  as
something  else  for the duration of the spell. The illusion has  visual  and
minor  auditory  (such as crackling of fire, mumbling, etc.,  similar  to  an
improved phantasmal force) components only. The form is chosen by the wizard,
and unwilling creatures gain a saving throw. The illusion can be as small  as
half  the  size of the creature masked, and as large as something that  would
fit within ¬ cubic yard + ¬ cubic yards per level.

      Once  the form is taken, it remains almost stationary, with only  minor
movement  possible;  for  example, a troll  illusion  could  growl  and  make
threatening motions but could not walk and attack, and a fire could dance and
crackle  but  could not spread. For this reason, objects are the  forms  most
often  chosen.  Movement is not possible for the recipient  creature  if  the
spell  is  to be maintained, as this would break the spell. If the  recipient
remains  still or nearly still, however, the spell will last so long  as  the
wizard  maintains faint concentration (spell casting and taking damage breaks
the  spell,  but talking and walking do not), and remains within 1  yard  per
level of the location of the recipient (obviously not a problem if the wizard
and  the  recipient  are the same person). If the spell  is  broken  for  any
reason,  it will last a further 1d3 rounds + 1 round per level of the wizard.
The illusion does not follow any movement made by its recipient.

When  cast,  this spell causes a creature's spirit to be bound to a  specific
area.  The  wizard may elect to have the spirit enter a building or  just  to
wander  about  a certain area. The type of spirit depends on the  bone  used,
which  is the material component. The spell's duration is one month per level
of  the  wizard. After this period, the spirit is free to do as  it  pleases,
leave or stay.
The  saving  throw is made at half the level or Hit Dice of the  creature  to
which the used bone once belonged.

This  spell  creates  either an immobile, faintly shimmering  magical  sphere
around  the caster that prevents any 1st-level spell effects from penetrating
or a mobile, faintly shimmering field around the caster that prevents any 1st-
and 50% of all 2nd-level spell effects from penetrating. This includes innate
abilities  and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can  be  cast
out  of  the magical sphere or field, and these pass from the caster  to  the
subject without affecting the globe or field. The caster can enter and  leave
the  globe  version  without penalty: the field disappears  when  the  caster
leaves  it. Note that spell effects are not disrupted by the globe  or  field
unless  cast  directly  into it. Area effect spells, however,  are  disrupted
within  the globe or field only as long as the caster is inside the globe  or
field.

The  material component of the spell is a glass or crystal bead that shatters
at the expiration of the spell.

With  this  spell,  several wizards can combine their magical  abilities  and
powers  to  create greater spells. If several casters want to  combine  their
efforts,  they must first decide who will be the head weaver. This person  is
the  centre  of the spell: without him, the entire spell structure collapses.
Also,  if  he loses concentration all the efforts are lost and the spells  as
well.  Next, they must decide which spell they are going to create. To create
this  spell, they may use several different or all the same spells of  weaker
levels which, combined, give the desired spell. These spells must in some way
be  related  to  the  desired spell. The DM should rule what  spells  can  be
combined.
To participate, all members of a "spellcloth" must roll their chance to learn
spells:  if they miss it, they lose the spell and their effort isn't  counted
into  the whole of the spell. If the head weaver misses his roll, he  made  a
mistake in the weaving of the spells into the new one and everything is lost.
To  calculate  how much energy is created, take the number of mages  involved
(specialists count as 1« if they cast a spell within their specialty but as «
if  not)  and  divide  this  number by the total  number  of  mages  involved
(specialist  now  count as one). If the resulting figure is larger  than  1¬,
make  it  equal to that number. Multiply this number by the total  number  of
spell  levels involved (i.e.: add all levels of the individual spells). Round
down.  If  the energy created by the cloth is not enough to form the  desired
spell, the next spell in line is created instead.
The  experience  level at which the spell is cast is the head weaver's  level
plus half the level of every other wizard involved. If this is lower than the
minimum needed to cast the final spell then the spell is still cast,  but  at
the casting level of this imaginary lower level wizard.
Because  spell  weaving  takes  a  lot  of  time,  spellweavers  always  lose
initiative. Also, the weavers cannot be separated by more than 10  feet,  and
no  barriers may be between any individual and the head caster. The number of
mages involved is also limited: 5 for a minor weaving. Minor weavers count as
when  included  in a major weaving and as   if included in a  master  weaving
(q.v.) for the purpose of calculating the maximum number of mages.
Minor  weaving can only take 3rd-level spells or lower to weave  successfully
(the desired spell can be of higher level).

Though  minor wish is a weaker version of limited wish, it is still a  potent
spell in its own right. Any spell effect up to fourth level can be duplicated
with  minor  wish.  Examples of other effects possible with  this  spell  are
limited  teleportation (line of sight or well-known location only), summoning
a  personal item, etc. This spell cannot raise dead like limited wish, but it
can  be  used  to increase the chances of a resurrection attempt  succeeding.
Like all wish-type magics, careful DM adjudication is required.

Beginning  the  round after Miranda's magestorm is cast,  the  caster  begins
firing  two lightning bolts per round at any targets within range. The  total
number  of  bolts he may fire is equal to one half of his level, rounded  up,
and  the damage each bolt inflicts is 1d4 per caster level (save versus spell
for half damage for that bolt only).
The  caster must discharge both bolts each round (either at targets or simply
into  the  air  or  ground). If he is unable to do so (stunned,  unconscious,
dead, held, etc.) then he suffers the damage the bolts would normally inflict
himself.  Note that simply being damaged during a round does not prevent  the
release of the bolts. Full movement is possible while throwing the bolts, but
other actions, such as attacking or spellcasting, are not. Each bolt requires
the  wizard  to  make  an  attack roll, counting only Dexterity  and  magical
bonuses  to Armour Class. The caster is not penalized for making two  attacks
per round.
Each  bolt  dissipates  when it strikes its target. If  it  misses,  then  it
rebounds to the full extent of its range (80 feet).

The  material components for this spell are a bit of fur, two finely  crafted
silver  spheres, no less than 1 inch in diameter, and a silver pin  for  each
bolt the caster intends to unleash. The fur and the pins are consumed in  the
casting, but the spheres are not.

This spell is a modified mirror image spell. When it is cast, 1d4+1 images of
the  wizard appear in various places around him (in a 20-foot radius). Within
seconds,  they all start running in different directions. They are  basically
unseen servants that have an illusion upon them of the wizard. They will  run
until  4  points  of damage have been inflicted upon them or  3  rounds  have
expired. The material component of this spell is a small smoke bomb  that  is
cast down as the wizard's feet.

With  this power a psionicist can create three exact copies of  he
body  by  manipulating light waves.  There  must  be  light  waves
present for this power to work.  This is a combat enhancement  and
has very little use anywhere else.  When used it creates a row  of
four,  one  being the real psionicist and three being  copies,  in
random  order  and the copies and the psionicist  are  continually
switching  places.  This gives the psionicist 3 chances  in  4  to
escape  damage  from his opponents blows.  After  each  successful
attack against the psionicist, he will roll a four sided dice.  On
a  1 the psionicist takes to damage like normal.  On a 2, 3, or  4
one  of the copies was hit.  Sense the copies are only manipulated
light swords, arrows, and all other forms of physical attack  pass
throw  it doing no damage.  Telepathic attacks are no affected  by
these power.

Power  Score:   Seven copies are created giving the  psionicist  7
chances in 8 to escape damage.

20:   A  bright flash of light is created instead of  the  copies,
blinding the psionicist for 1D4 rounds.

The  priest  who casts this spell then deliberately miscounts any  number  of
similar  objects  (of a maximum weight of 5 pounds per level  of  the  priest
total).  The  magic  of the spell causes the number of  objects  to  actually
become  this  new number. The priest may change the number to  anything  from
double the original quantity to one fifth. The number of objects remains  the
same until one turn per level has passed or until any other creature tries to
count  them. The material component of this spell is a detached bead from  an
abacus.

A  missile must be fired within the next twelve seconds. This spell makes 3d6
missiles out of one. Only normal missiles are affected.
The  stuff  disappears one round after shooting, but their  effects  stay.  A
nasty assassin in my game used the 5th-level version of this spell with sleep-
poison darts to capture a PC.
You  have to roll to hit for each missile, by the way. However, if your first
missile hits, you have a +3 on all thereafter.

missiles  out of one. Unlike the 4th-level version, the 5th-level version  of
this  spell  will  multiply "abnormal" missiles, like poison darts,  ballista
bolts, catapult rocks and other such things. All other effects are similar to
the  spell of fourth level. The possibility of using lethal poison is at  the
DM's option.

When  this  spell  is cast, the missiles affected by it multiply  when  fired
adding  an additional 1d4 missiles. Each missile must roll separately to  hit
its  target,  but  it does get the to-hit and damage bonus  of  the  original
missile. The duplicate arrows last until the spell duration expires and  then

      Mist creates a huge fog cloud that can be seen through, but reduces the
range  of  vision  greatly. In normal use, all sighting  distances  (see  the
Player's  Handbook) are halved. Vision can be decreased to  a  third  of  its
normal range by reducing the area of effect to one cube (with a 25-foot side)
per level.

      The  shape  of the cloud must be rectangular. For example, a  2nd-level
wizard could create a mist of 100x50x50 feet.

The use of this power allows a psionicist to mold earth in a fast,
almost instantaneous manner.  This power allows the user to change
the  shape  of any earthen object, even the actual ground  itself.
It can be used to build instant stone bridges, earthen pillars, or
even used as an attack by creating stone fists to punch opponents.
If  a  fist  of  stone  is created, it will cause  1d4  points  of
damage/10  cubic feet of stone that is used.  It can  also  create
breeches  in walls or other effects.  Any object created  will  be
rough  and  like  it's original substance.   Fine  detail  can  be
accomplished  by using this power but with an area  of  affect  of
1/10th the original size.

Power  Score:   Fine detail can be done at normal  size,  but  the
preparation time is doubled.

20:  A 20' pit opens below the psionicist, the result of displaced
earth.

This  power  is the opposite of the molecular agitation  devotion;
instead  of increasing the movement of molecules inside an object,
this  power  slows them down, chilling the object. The  amount  of
damping determines the effects:
      *  1  round:  things become cool to the touch, skin  becomes
clammy (no damage), some condensation (if humidity permits)
     * 2 rounds: skin becomes numb (1-2 pts damage), water becomes
slushy,  items  become cold to the touch, condensation  coats  the
surface, paper becomes brittle
      *  3  rounds: skin starts to freeze (1-3 pts damage),  water
freezes,  metal  becomes cold to the touch (1 pt damage,  possibly
freezing  to  the  surface),  condensation  freezes,  plants  die,
leather weakens
      *  4  rounds:  freezing temperatures harm tissues  (1-4  pts
damage),  thin layer of ice if humidity permits, skin  freezes  to
metal (1-4 pts damage), wood/plants/leather becomes brittle
      *  5  rounds:  hypothermia possible (1-6  pts  damage  max),
possible  limb  loss,  thick layer of ice (if possible),  minerals
weaken
      *  6  rounds:  rock  becomes brittle,  metal  weakens,  skin
permanently freezes to metal
     * 7 rounds: rock shatters like glass, metal becomes brittle
     * 8 rounds: metal shatters like glass
     * 10 rounds: adamantite weakens (maximum weakening)

Weakening means that the substance has a -2 penalty to all  saving
throws  (-4 vs. cold). Brittleness means that the object  has  the
qualities  of  thin  crystal, being easily breakable,  and  having
similar  saving throws. It still takes a good blow (from  a  blunt
object) to shatter the item. Becoming "like glass" means that  the
object  can  be  shattered  easily, in  the  palm  of  one's  hand
(hopefully  protected from cold!), and that all saving throws  are
made  glass.  However, the shards are incredibly  cold,  and  very
sharp.  Shattering a sword with an unprotected hand  could  easily
cause  2-12  points  of  damage,  plus  whatever  cold  damage  is
possible.
      The  "layer  of  ice" effects are up to the  DM.  In  desert
situations, a "thick" coating might only be 1/10 of an  inch,  but
in  a  humid jungle, the thick layer may be up to 6 inches  thick.
The  "layer of ice" effect has many uses near (or in) a large body
of water.

Power Score:  Rate of damping doubles (as per molecular agitation)

20:   The psionicist botches the damping, and the item is affected
by  Molecular Agitation (whether or know the psionicist knows that
devotion), but the psionicist is unaware of any problems.

By  casting this spell, the wizard is able to draw a fairly well detailed map
of  the surrounding terrain onto blank paper, which is the material component
for  this  spell. The wizard casting this spell must give total concentration
to   the  spell  for  the  entire  10  minutes.  If  the  wizard  loses   his
concentration, the partially drawn map will fade from view and the spell must
be repeated.
The range of this spell varies as follows:
  Above the ground: 1 mile per level of the wizard.
  Underground: 100 feet per level of the wizard.
   Inside  a  structure: the wizard will get a detailed map of the  floor  or
level he is on. However, the map will show nothing beyond the outer walls. If
the  floor  or level is bigger than the wizard's maximum radius, then  follow
the underground rule.
While  this spell is very handy, it does have some drawbacks. Nothing on  the
map  is  labelled. Also, the map will not show people. For instance, the  map
will  show where a town is (if it is in range) but it won't give you the name
of  that  town and it won't tell you if there are any people in the town.  In
other words, this spell results in a terrain-like map.

The  material component for this spell is a piece of paper (or something like
that) and a writing instrument of some kind.

This  spell causes an area of the earth to bubble up molten lava in its  area
of  effect. After the wizard spends one round casting, using up the  material
components of sulphur and lava rock, the spell begins. In the first round the
ground  tremors slightly, and those not wearing heavy feet covering  such  as
metal boots can feel a slight warmth.
In  the second round of the spell the heat becomes very pronounced, and  will
ignite paper, cloth, and dry vegetation touching the ground. If the people in
the area of effect did not announce that they were moving in this round, they
are going to be injured.
In  the  third round the ground becomes molten lava, wooden furniture  bursts
into  flames, and metals with low melting points start to soften.  Anyone  in
the area of effect takes 3d6 points of damage, 2d6 this round only if wearing
thick  shoes. In each additional round spent in the area of effect  a  person
takes  3d6  points of damage, and any items carried by the person  must  safe
versus fire or be destroyed.
The  intense heat of the lava may cause structural damage to walls  that  are
near  or  in the area of effect. Wooden walls will be destroyed by fire  just
like wooden furniture. Protection from Fire will protect a person but not his
items from this spell. Note that lava rock is hard to obtain in most medieval
settings,  and  that  the lava generated by this spell will  not  work  as  a
component for later casting (it's marked by magic).

This  spell  causes  1d4  creatures in a 20-foot cube to  momentarily  become
disoriented, enough to add +4 to their initiative roll in the next round.  If
only one creature is in the area of effect, it gets a -3 to its saving throw,
two targets each have a -2, if three are in range, they have a -1. The wizard
casts  this spell by holding his arm straight out, his wrist bent  up  at  90
degrees, saying "Hungh!". The material component for this spell is a piece of

This  spell was devised by the archmage Montero the Sore Loser. It creates  a
special  bond around the life force of the caster, waiting to receive another
life force. If during the duration of the spell, the caster is slain, he dies
alright,  but so does his killer (no saving throw, magic resistance applies).
At that point, both their life forces are connected with a special bond, so a
long as the caster if still dead, his killer cannot be raised or resurrected.
Once  the caster if back to life, his killer may be brought to life as  well.
If  the  caster was slain in such way that prevents resurrection  completely,
the killer is also dead forever.

The  material component of the spell is a medallion with a 5000 gp gem, which
must  be  worn around the caster's neck. the medallion disappears once  spell
duration  ends,  or once it's activated. Its premature destruction  ends  the
spell.

This  spell  causes the wizard to immediately discharge all  spells  that  he
currently has memorized forward in a 10 yard radius. All within the  area  of
effect are subject to the effects of all spells of fifth level or lower  that
the  caster  has  memorized. Spells of a level higher than 5  are  discharged
without  effect.  Recipients  are entitled to only  one  saving  throw  which
protects them from the effects of all lesser-level spells for which there  is
a  saving  throw. After casting this spell, the caster is knocked unconscious
for  1d4  rounds (70% chance) or be driven insane for 1d4 days (30%  chance).
Spells  requiring material components go off only if the caster  is  actually
carrying  the  components, which are expended. If the caster is not  carrying
the  components  for a spell, the spell goes off in a blast of  wild  magical
energy,  inflicting  one point damage per level of the spell  to  all  within
spell range, including the wizard.

This  spell simulates the priestly power to turn undead. This effect  happens
under  the same restrictions. The wizard has to approach the undead with  his
spell components in hand. The priestly effect of the turning is dependant  on
the  alignment  of  the wizard casting the spell. If the wizard  is  good  he
destroys or turns the undead, if he is evil the undead are controlled, if  he
is  neutral he can choose which effect is to happen. The effect is rolled  on
the  priest's turning table with the following addition: if the level of  the
wizard  is  above the level that is absolutely necessary to turn the  undead,
the  wizard gains a +1 bonus for every five levels above the necessary level.
Thus, the lowly undead are almost assuredly under the control of a 12th-level
wizard.  If  the wizard does not succeed with his roll to turn  any  kind  of
undead  present then all undead are not turned or controlled: if  the  wizard
faces  20  skeletons, 10 wights and one special undead and he fails  only  to
turn  the  special undead, he automatically fails to turn all undead  present
(even the skeletons). Thus, this spell is not very useful with a congregation
of  undead,  but  it can be used to get some nice effects  with  lower  level
undead.  The  wizard can affect a maximum of one undead per level,  beginning
with the lowest powered ones.

The material component is a part of every type of undead the wizard wishes to
turn  or  control. If that part actually was part of that specific  creature,
that creature is turned or controlled automatically.

This  spell  is  an improved version of imbue undead with spell  ability.  It
gives  one undead creature which is not normally able to cast spells  or  use
spell-like  abilities like energy drain the ability to cast up to one  spell.
This  spell  can be used multiple times on these undead until they  have  the
power  to cast one spell per Hit Die they possess, maximum. For undead  which
can  already use spells or spell-like effects (see above), it gives them  the
ability to cast one spell for every level of the caster plus one per Hit Die,
maximum. These spells it regains at the stroke of midnight, whether  cast  or
not. The spells given and implanted in the undead are given by the caster  of
the  spell.  These spells are permanently removed from his memory until  they
relearn  this  spell as if they had never heard of it (roll their  chance  to
learn a new spell).
The  spells  have to be cast during the ritual imbuing the undead with  their
spell  abilities.  For  these  spells, the undead  don't  need  any  kind  of
components  (neither  verbal, nor somatic, nor material components)  but  the
material  components  have to be provided during the ritual  in  addition  to
those noted below.

The  material component for this spell is one potion of undead control of the
type  of  undead which is imbued with the spell plus one scroll of  with  the
spell to be imbued - and only that spell must be written on that scroll.

This  spell increases the physical powers of an undead. This spell can  grant
an  undead  creature physical strengths up to a maximum of the level  of  the
caster with a maximum of 25. Each point of Strength increase costs the wizard
one  Strength point and one Constitution point each - permanently.  Once  the
maximum of Strength for his level is reached, the wizard can try to boost the
fighting  level of the undead by one for every five Strength and Constitution
points  he  donates. This can be boosted to the level of  a  fighter  of  the
wizard's  level.  The  undead gain all bonuses of a fighter  of  that  level,
including  multiple  attacks, weapon proficiency slots, etc.  They  can  even
specialise  (even  with their claws or in punching, wrestling,  even  martial
arts).

The  material components are a potion of giant strength (of any kind)  and  a
potion  of  undead control of the type of undead to be boosted per  point  of
increase.

      This  spell is meant to be used by a wizard who is looking for  a  good
place to have a blast and get blasted. The spell seeks out all establishments
within  range and instantly gives the caster a mental impression of the  best
place,  with regards to its location, name, general appearance, and taste  of
the  wizard. The spell determines which is the "best" location by considering
the  following  factors,  in  descending order of  importance:  strength  and
quality  of drinks served, wildness factor, size of bar, and inexpensiveness.
If  there  is  no such location (at all) within spell range, the caster  must
save  versus death magic or fall into a 1d4 round coma, and emerges  from  it
weeping but unharmed. This spell is also known as Morrison's tavern locator.

      By  means of this cantrip, the caster conjures a very attractive person
of  the  opposite  sex to serve him or her. The person serves  willingly  and
well,  but at the expiration of the cantrip duration it disappears, returning
to  its own place. The mount does not come with any gear or clothes. It can't
do anything but perform basic sexual acts.
This cantrip was created by conjurer apprentices to practice their art. It is
only  a  cantrip  because the conjured being only serves one purpose  (a  fun
purpose, but not a practical purpose).

    This  devotion  allows the psionicist  to  move  a  number  of
electrons through an object, causing electrical damage to it.  The
cost is variable, but the longer a psionicist prepares to use  the
power,  the more electrons that can be moved. Creatures  that  are
made  out  of electricity take half damage (if somebody rearranged
parts  of  your  body, it would still hurt). Creatures  immune  to
lightning or electrical damage are not affected by this  power  at
all.
      It  is  possible  to use this power against  more  than  one
creature, but only if they are connected by a good conductor (like
metallic  armor  or  very salty water); in this  case,  damage  is
divided between all connected creatures, with the target and those
nearest the target taking the most damage. Magical metallic  items
will never conduct from creature to creature.

Preparation Time    Cost Damage
0 rounds (immediate)     6    1d4 + 1
1 round   8    1d8 + 1
2 rounds  11   2d8

Metallic Armor: +2 points damage, plus possible conduction

More  than two rounds of moving electrons will not increase damage
for  mortal psionicists, but a psionic lich or demi-god with  this
power  could  use greater preparation times for even more  damage.
The DM can increase damage as seen fit, but I would max the damage
at  4d8+4  (8-36 hit points) for 4 rounds of preparation  time  --
anything else would be too much like a wizard spell.
      The  longer  the preparation time, the louder the  discharge
will  be;  with  no preparation, the sound will be barely  audible
beyond 10 feet, but with two rounds of preparation time, the sound
could  easily carry 50 feet or more, and would echo in underground
circumstances.
      NOTE:  I have not tried to use "real world" physics  to  the
letter  to create this power. If any DM allowing this power wishes
to  make  it more "realistic" (using voltages, amps, or whatever),
feel free. Dammit, I'm a DM, not an electrician!

Power Score:  Damage occurs on the next greater die type (either a
d6 or a d10) and the damage bonus increases to +2.

20:   The power backfires; the psionic takes 1/2 normal damage and
cannot use this power for another 3 turns. The victim is unharmed.

This  power  lets  the  psionicist move the viewing  spot  of  his
clairvoyance,  or the focus of his clairaudience.  By  paying  the
initial  cost,  the  psionicist can change  the  direction  he  is
viewing.  Movement  in  this  way is not  restricted  by  physical
barriers.
      The  psionicist can move the focus by paying the maintenance
cost.
Maintenance   is  1  PSP  per  6'  of  movement  per   round   for
clairvoyance,  and  1  PSP per 3' for clairaudience.  The  minimum
maintenance  cost  is 1 PSP per round, so even if  the  psionicist
wants  to stop moving the focus temporarily, he must pay, or  else
he  must  make a new power check and pay the initial cost when  he
wants to move it again.

Power Score:  Movement rate is doubled for the same PSP cost.

20:  The clairaudience or clairvoyance power fails.

This  spell creates a huge ball of fire that can be shaped into any form  the
caster  wishes.  For example, the flame sculpture could  be  changed  into  a
table, ladder, bucket, stilts, or cane, all sculpted from raw flame. However,
all sculpted objects, having been formed from solid flames, will cause damage
and ignite combustibles as normal fires would. Any creature in contact with a
flame  sculpture  takes  damage equal to the  caster's  level  per  round  of
contact, save for half damage. Any combustible item must save versus  magical
fire or be incinerated. Only the caster himself and any items in contact with
his body are immune to the flames' effects.
The  flame sculpture can be as large one cubic foot per level of the  caster.
Once  an  object  is  formed, it cannot be re-sculpted during  the  remaining
duration  of  the  spell. The object created must be fairly  rigid,  have  no
moving  parts,  have  no  sharp point or edge,  and  have  no  fine  details.
Therefore,  a rope, sword, chariot, or accurate statue could not be  created.
No  sculpture can be harmed by anything other than water; to destroy a  flame
sculpture, it must be immersed in a number of gallons of water equal  to  the
caster's level.

The material component of this spell is a drop of wine.

By  use  of  this spell, the casting wizard can transform himself or  another
creature  into  a  ball of flame. While in this form, the  affected  creature
temporarily loses all his possessions and spellcasting abilities, but is able
to  fly at a speed of 48 (A) and cause damage to opponents simply by crashing
into  them. While immolated, a character strikes with the normal THAC0  of  a
monster half his level or Hit Dice. A hit causes 6d6 HP of fire damage.
An  immolated creature can be harmed only by cold-based attacks  and  magical
weapons  while  in fireball form. Cold causes double damage to the  creature,
while magical weapons cause normal damage. However, an immolated creature  in
motion is extremely hard to hit, having a base Armour Class of -2, which  may
be bettered (but not worsened) by the creature's natural Armour Class without
armour or other protection.

The material component of this spell is some sulphur.

This  spell is the most advanced of the flame sculpture class of spells.  The
object formed can be highly complex, containing many moving parts, such as  a
siege  machine  or  a  spelljammer. Parts of an object created  could  be  as
flexible  as  a  rope  or the wood of a bow, so a large net,  ballista,  rope
bridge, or collection of crossbows could be formed. Up to one cubic yard  per
level of flame can be created and sculpted. Otherwise, this spell conforms to
the  description  of the lesser flame sculptures, except that  the  sculpture
causes  1« HP of damage per level per round of contact with a living creature
(rounded down), and non-magical combustible items get no saving throw at  all
to  resist  the flames. Magical combustibles may saving throw versus  magical
fire at -2 to avoid being destroyed.

The material component of this spell is a drop of pure alcohol.

This incredibly destructive spell should be used only if the caster wants  to
utterly annihilate everything close to him. The spell draws upon the caster's
life  force  and explosively blows it apart, blasting everything  within  the
area  of effect to dust and ash. All living creatures have a chance to  avoid
utter  destruction by rolling a 20 on 1d20. In this case, the lucky  creature
is  reduced to 1 HP. Otherwise, creatures slain by the explosion have a  mere
20%   chance   of   surviving  resurrection  by  any  spell,   even   wishes.
Unfortunately, the caster himself is blasted to atoms, destroying any and all
hope  of resurrection. Unless he takes some form of precaution before casting
the  spell,  he will be forever killed. A contingency teleporting the  caster
away  at  the  instant the spell is cast will not save him, for  the  spell's
energies  will  still  blow  up his life force as  soon  as  he  reaches  his
destination.  Use  this spell only when you're using  a  character  whom  you
either don't like or whom you don't use that often anyway.

The material component of this spell is a mushroom.

This  variation  on the more common invisible stalker calls forth  a  phantom
stalker  (see  the  Fiend  Folio for information on this  monster)  from  the
elemental  plane  of  fire.  The creature obeys  and  serves  the  caster  in
performing  whatever  tasks it is assigned, most commonly  to  serve  as  the
caster's  bodyguard.  However, like its cousin  the  invisible  stalker,  the
creature  resents its servitude and seeks to twist its master's  instructions
whenever possible, anxious to return to its native plane.
There  is  one explicit instruction inherent in the summoning of the  phantom
stalk If the caster is ever killed with a phantom stalker in his service, the
stalker will immediately vanish, and reappear 1d4 hours later, having tracked
their summoner's killer from the ethereal plane. The stalkers only gain  this
ability  once their summoner is killed, and the ability vanishes as  soon  as
the summoner's slayer has been tracked.

The material component of this spell is a piece of clear glass.

This  spell  is  a more advanced form of the 5th-level flame  sculpture.  The
object  or  objects formed from the flames can be more complex,  composed  of
large,  moving  parts, or have an edge or a point, but still must  be  fairly
rigid.  A  wagon,  quiver of arrows, shovel, sword, or  wheel  could  all  be
created from the fire, but not a crossbow, spring, or coil of rope. Up  to  8
cubic feet of flame per level of the caster can be created at once. All other
respects  of this spell are identical to the 5th-level spell except  for  one
thing:  combustible items brought into contact with the sculpture make  their
saving throws versus magical fire at -1.

The material component of this spell is a drop of gin.

This  spell  can  be used to increase the interstellar speed of  spelljamming
helms.  It does not increase the tactical combat speed (it does not  increase
the  SR). The increase is dependent on the level: x2 at levels 14-16,  x3  at
levels 17-19, +1 to the multiplier per 3 levels above 19.
This  spell can be cast multiple times on the helm depending on the level  of
the  caster. The spell may be cast on the helm once for every full 20  levels
(only once at levels 14 to 39, twice from 40 to 59, etc.). The speed which is
multiplied is always the current speed at which the helm is travelling at the
time.  It  can be made permanent only once on a given helm, but the temporary
version may be cast on the helm as often as described above.
The  reverse, reduce interstellar helm speed, will reduce the speed of a helm
to  a fraction of its interstellar speed. This reduction will not be apparent
until  the affected ship drops out of its first interstellar journey in which
it  was  affected  and notices that it has not travelled as  far.  The  speed
reduction  is  a  fraction determined by taking the factor  given  above  and
creating the reciprocal out of it. Thus, a 17th-level caster could reduce the
speed  to  . The helm only gets a saving throw against this spell if  it  has
been  used  within  the  last  hour, or if  it  is  an  artifurnace-including
artifact. It then gets a saving throw versus spell like its latest  user.  If
failed, the spell takes effect; otherwise, the spell is wasted. The spell can
be negated with dispel magic, but there is a possibility of negating the helm
for a while, too. If the helm is freed from this spell by a roll of 20 on the
dispel  magic table, then the helm is also affected for the duration  of  the
reduce  interstellar helm speed spell. During this time it does  not  produce
any locomotive force for the ship.

The  material  component  of  the  spell is  the  distilled  essence  of  ten
quicklings  per  factor.  The  quicklings must  have  given  up  their  lives
willingly (without magical or psionic coercion) for the caster. An additional
component  is one potion of speed for every factor increase over the  current
speed.

By  means  of  this  spell,  the wizard may drain the  magical  essence  from
powerful  items,  thus acquiring mana or special abilities.  Of  course,  the
spell  requires the material component of a magic item, and the effects  vary
with  the  item,  however,  as a rule of thumb, the  number  of  mana  points
acquired equal one hundredth of the experience point value of the item  where
given. Magic items are allowed to saving throw against magic as wizards of  a
level equal to their mana point value, success indicating that the wizard was
unable  to  complete the spell and the magic resulted in spell  failure  (see
spell failure rules).
As  an interesting side note, the wizard must save versus spell when snuffing
intelligent items or suffer a schizophrenia where the wizard must  share  his
mind  with  the  spirit  of  the  item in question.  Powerful  artifacts  are
particularly nasty in this respect, having the ability of conferring  special
capacities  upon  the wizard, however, the risk of possession  or  domination
also  rises  with the increased profit to be had. The material component  for
this spell is a sap.

      The caster of this spell can check one weapon per round to determine if
it  was  used  to  kill a specific corpse, of whom he has a blood  sample.  A
murder weapon is one that reduced the victim to zero hit points, or delivered
the  poison which did so. The material component of this spell is a  drop  of

      The psionicist using this power gains a very good picture of
his  surroundings composed with improved uses of all other senses.
The  picture he sees is colorless and quite hazy but the character
can  see  in all directions simultaneously as in all-round vision.
Additionally, his field of vision is doubled.
      This  picture is composed using sounds, tactile  sensations,
felling the air movement, smells, ... it is the result of a  group
work  of  all  senses.  The psionicist should close his  eyes  and
cannot  use  his  normal  vision when using  this  power.  If  the
psionicist uses his normal vision the power ends.
      Radar  sense allows the psionicist to "see" even in complete
darkness.    Even  magical  darkness  won't  affect  this   power.
Invisible objects can be seen just as easily as other objects, and
illusions can be easily detected. Very small details, as  well  as
painted  patterns, pictures or writings cannot be  seen  by  using
radar sense. If the psionicist touch the writings he can "see"  it
with  the tactile effect, but he still has only a black and  white
picture.
      Spell  effect  as  magical silence or vacuum  can  blur  the
picture  but cannot "blind" this radar, since it uses  all  senses
except  vision.  The DM can assign penalties for any  effect  that
disturbs one of the senses, except vision.
      The  DM can optionally grant a bonus to some tasks made with
this power. (e.g. Acrobatics, move silence, hide in shadows, ...)
      Reference:  Dare Devil (Matt Murdock), The man without  fear
(Comic)

Power  Score:   All  senses are perfect  and  the  psionicist  can
perform  any  task  much  better (gain  a  +2  or  +20%  bonus  in
everything)

20:  Overflow or signals. The psionicist is blind and deaf for 2d4
rounds.

Mylzek's werechange alters the form of the caster to a half-man, half-monster
killing machine. For the duration of the spell, the caster gains 2 extra  hit
points per level to a maximum of 20 at tenth level. The spell allows a +1  to
the caster's THAC0 roll and he gets 3 attacks doing 1d4+2/1d4+2/1d10.
When  casting a spell in this form, the caster must first make a learn spells
check  to do so. If this roll is not successful, the caster may try again  in
the next round.
When  a  wizard  casts  this  spell for the first time,  his  non-proficiency
penalty  to his THAC0 roll is applied with the spell's bonus of +1  (i.e.,  -
5+1=-4  to-hit).  Multi-classed mages use their best non-proficiency  penalty
for  this.  For every ten castings of Mylzek's werechange after  that  (count
only  the  ones  in  which  combat occurs), the  caster  gets  a  +1  to-hit.
Eventually,  this  will make up for the penalty and  even  go  beyond  to  an
overall bonus of +2 (maximum).
The  caster  must choose the appearance of his were-form the  first  time  he
casts this spell. Any appearance will do as long as half of it is animal- and
the  other half is human-like. A wizard may only have up to 2 were-forms.  He
may  only  use  one form each time he casts the spell. Note:  a  wizard  must
become proficient in each form separately.
Note: The caster controls which animal he will simulate and the colour of his
body during the change. He receives the movement rate of the animal type  and
possibly  the  ability to breathe water (but not air) if it is a  water-bound
form.

This power opens an immobile conduit for mystical energy from  the
area  immediately  surrounding the psionicist to  anywhere  within
line  of   sight (see cost).  The next spell cast from  where  the
psionicist  was standing at the time the power was initiated  will
function as if it was cast at the other end of the conduit.   Thus
the  ranges  of  certain spells can be greatly increased.   Notice
that spells, which affect the caster only (i.e., personal spells),
will  now   affect  whoever is standing at the other  end  of  the
conduit  or  be  wasted if nobody is standing there.   A  vampiric
touch  (or fire shield) for example, could be cast at one end  and
whoever  was  at the other end could now apply the vampiric  touch
(or  be  protected by a fire shield), and gain the  full  benefits
from  it  (i.e., reach out and touch someone, in case  a  vampiric
touch  had  been  cast).  The original caster  has  absolutely  no
control  over the spell--it is as if the whoever was  standing  at
the  other end of the conduit had actually cast the spell.   Since
the  accuracy and power required for transferring personal  spells
is much greater than for other spells, the cost is increased to 40
PSP's + 1 PSP per 10 yards.
      The  mystic conduit is visible only by a detect magic,  true
sight,  or psionic powers such as Heightened senses.  It collapses
the  instant   any   spell is conducted in  this  way  or  if  the
psionicist ceases paying the maintenance Cost.
      NOTE:  The conduit is one way only, thus it is not  possible
for  a  psionicist  to steal a spell, as it is being  cast  by  an
opponent.

Prerequisite:    Dimensional  door,  6th  level   psionicist   and
knowledge of either Mage or Priest magic.

Power Score:  No PSP's must be paid to maintain this power.

20:  The next spell cast near the psionicist will backfire.

When  this spell is cast, the wizard is surrounded by an invisible  shell  of
energy;  this shell is invisible to the naked eye, but true seeing or similar
magic will reveal it, and detect magic will detect strong lines of abjuration
magic  with weaker evocation lines. While under the protection of this spell,
if  the  wizard is hit in melee, the shell will emit a burst of  pure  energy
that  lashes out at the attacker. The energy will inflict an identical amount
of  damage  as that inflicted on the wizard by the melee attack  (the  wizard
still  receives  normal damage). If the attacker makes  a  successful  saving
throw  versus spell, he will only suffer half damage. The shell will continue
to  emit energy bursts on attackers as long as the spell's duration lasts, or
until the shell is dispelled.

The  material  component for this spell is a small, metal shield  and  a  gem
worth at least 400 gp. Both components are destroyed when the spell is cast.

When  this  spell is cast, a crackling, black bolt shoots from  the  wizard's
palm  towards its victim. The wizard must make a successful to-hit roll (with
a  +2 bonus) in order to hit the target; if this roll misses, use the grenade
scatter diagram to determine if anyone else is hit by the bolt. If anyone  is
in  the  area of the miss, a normal to-hit roll (with no bonus)  is  used  to
determine if the stray bolt hits anyone.
Anyone who is hit by the bolt must make a saving throw versus spell; if  this
roll  is successful, the spell has no effect and the bolt dissipates. If  the
saving  throw  fails, the victim immediately loses half of  his  current  hit
points  (round  fractions down), and is rendered unconscious  by  the  shock.
These lost hit points may be regained through normal means.

The  material component for this spell is an onyx gem worth at least 500  gp.
The gem is held in the hand of the wizard, and is consumed when the spell  is
cast.

This  spell is identical to Mystyk's backlash except for the following:  when
the wizard is hit in melee, if he makes a successful saving throw versus rod,
staff  or  wand, the attack only inflicts half normal damage (rounded  down).
Also,  the energy bursts inflict an additional point of damage per  level  of
the  wizard,  up  to a maximum of 20; this damage is halved if  the  attacker
successfully saves versus spell. For example, if a 14th-level wizard  is  hit
with  a  melee  attack for 12 points of damage, the wizard  would  suffer  12
points of damage, or 6 if the saving throw is successful; the attacker  would
suffer 12+14 = 26 points of damage, or 13 if the saving throw succeeds.

The  material  component  for this spell is the same  as  that  for  Mystyk's
backlash except the gem must be worth at least 600 gp.

This  spell  is  identical  to  Mystyk's improved  backlash  except  for  the
following: when the wizard is hit in melee, any damage suffered is halved; in
addition, if the wizard makes a successful saving throw versus rod, staff  or
wand,  the attack inflicts no damage at all. Also, the energy bursts  inflict
10d6 points of damage on any attacker; a successful saving throw versus spell
reduces this damage by half.

The  material  component  for this spell is the same  as  that  for  Mystyk's
backlash except the gem must be worth at least 800 gp.

This  spell causes a sparking, blue ray to shoot from the wizard's hand;  the
ray  will  strike any creature as chosen by the wizard. When the ray  strikes
the  target,  it will evolve into a vortex of electricity that surrounds  the
victim.  The  target must make a saving throw versus spell  at  -4;  if  this
saving  throw  succeeds, the spell ends with no effect. If the  saving  throw
fails,  the  victim suffers damage equal to 1d8 HP + 1 HP per  level  of  the
wizard, and the spell continues. Each round, a new saving throw must be made,
with  a  cumulative +1 bonus (i.e. -3 on the second round, -2 on  the  third,
etc.);  the spell ends if a saving throw is successful, otherwise the  victim
is  again subject to a damage roll. The target must devote his entire  effort
on  escaping  the  vortex; if any other action is performed that  round,  the
saving  throw  automatically fails and damage is inflicted normally.  If  the
vicis  rendered  unconscious by the vortex, saving throws automatically  fail
(although   the   bonus   still  accumulates)  until   the   target   regains
consciousness.
If  a victim is killed by this spell, the vortex will immediately attack  the
nearest  enemy  of  the  wizard; if none exist (within  spell  range  of  the
wizard), the spell ends. The vortex moves at a rate of 24, and the new target
is attacked normally; the penalty or bonus to the saving throw resumes at the
point  it left off when the previous target was killed. For example,  if  the
initial  target  was killed during the fifth round, the new  victim's  saving
throw  begins with a +1 bonus. Any number of targets may be attacked by  this
spell,  as long as the saving throws are unsuccessful, and a potential target
is within range; otherwise, the spell ends.

The  material components for this spell are the heart and scales  of  a  blue
dragon,  and any gem worth at least 500 gp. All components are consumed  when
the spell is cast.

This  spell provides the wizard with a means of surviving on a hostile  plane
of existence. In order for this spell to work, the wizard must have access to
a  library  or  other source of information on the plane  in  question.  This
information must then be studied for an extended length of time; this  period
is  equal to: 24 weeks - 1 week per level of the wizard (to a minimum of  one
week). After this time has passed, the wizard is ready to cast the spell.
Each time this spell is cast for use on a new plane, the normal study time is
required. If cast for use on a previously studied plane, and less than a week
has  passed  since the last casting with respect to that plane, no additional
studying is necessary as the information is still fresh in the wizard's mind;
however, if more than a week has elapsed since the previous casting, a day of
brushing up is required.
If  the  wizard  is  a sage with expertise in the plane in  question,  normal
research  times  are required (see section on sages in the  Dungeon  Master's
Guide) the first time this spell is cast for use on that plane. If cast again
within  two  weeks, no additional time for studying is needed; if  cast  more
than  two weeks later, only 12 hours of brushing up is necessary. These times
also apply if the wizard is obtaining this information from another sage.
Using  the information gained from his studies, the wizard prepares the plane
survival  spell.  After one hour has passed, the spell is complete;  at  this
time, the DM secretly rolls percentile dice; a result of 5 or lower indicates
the  wizard has used erroneous information in the casting of the spell  which
will  reduce the protection afforded by the spell, and may even cause  it  to
fail  altogether  (the exact effects depend on the source of information  and
other factors, and it is left to the DM to decide the exact results). If some
or  all of the planar information was obtained by a sage who misdirected  the
wizard, the percentile roll has a -25% penalty applied to it. Even if correct
information is obtained from a sage, a -5% penalty applies, since the  wizard
is using secondhand information. In any case, if the roll results in a 1, the
spell  fails  altogether  (although the  wizard  will  not  know  this  until
attempting to make use of the spell's protection).
If  the  spell  was successfully cast, it will grant the wizard  (along  with
others,  if  the wizard's level is high enough) protection from  the  hostile
environment of the studied plane of existence. The recipients may move  about
in  the  plane  as if they were in the prime material plane; conditions  that
would  make  it hazardous or impossible to exist in the plane are negated  by
this  spell.  Spells have a chance of having normal effects while  under  the
influence  of the plane survival spell: when a spell is cast, if  the  wizard
makes  a  successful saving throw versus paralysation, his  spell  will  have
normal  effects (as if it were cast on the prime material plane)  instead  of
the effects it usually has on that plane.
If  the  recipients  are still on the plane when this spell  expires,  normal
characteristics  for that plane go into effect immediately.  Note  that  this
spell provides no way of moving from one plane to another; it only provides a
means of survival once a plane is reached. The wizard may have more than  one
of  these  spells in affect at a time, as long as the appropriate  amount  of
time has been spent studying each plane.

The  material components for this spell are a diamond worth at least 1000  gp
and  a  specimen of a substance related to the plane in question  (i.e.  some
fire  for the plane of fire, darkness for the negative material plane, etc.).
Alternately, something symbolising the plane may be used (i.e. a balance  for
the plane of concordant opposition).

In  my previous travels across the land as a very powerful wizard, I found  a
spell  that  was buried in the ground underneath the cave of an ancient  gold
dragon  wyrm  (he moved out of that cave centuries ago). After examining  the
spell on the scroll, I decided to destroy it. Never before have I seen such a
powerful  spell and after finding out that the scroll was both possessed  and
indestructible, I buried it deep within the caverns of the cave.
This  spell,  when properly incanted, will unleash a chain of raw corusacatin
magic  energy  which strikes the land with brutal force. There is  no  saving
throw whatsoever, and the land is tainted with the magic for 1 year per level
of  the  spell  caster. The land is destroyed, and charred, and nothing  will
grow  there as long as the magical taint remains. People who enter  the  area
must  make a saving throw versus spell, or fall sick for 3d6 days + 1d6  days
per level of wizard.

This  spell creates a fireball as the 3rd-level wizard spell, with the  added
benefit  of  silence within the area of effect. The silence  neutralizes  the
explosive  noise  of  the fireball itself, and lasts for  1d4  rounds  after.
However,  after the silence is dissipated, noise returns to normal, including
cries of those not killed outright by the blast. This spell was created by an
Evoker who often found himself trying to sneak in the back door. The materiel
components of this spell is a tiny ball of bat guano, sulphur, and  a  small,
muffled, silver bell worth not less than 100 gp.

      Narek's  shears causes hair, fur, or fur-like growth on the  target  to
shorten  by  up to an inch, possibly causing it to disappear. Its  effect  on
nearly  bare skin is to completely prevent growth for 2 days. The reverse  of
this  spell, augmented hairiness, causes hair or fur to thicken and  lengthen
by  up to two inches. This increase is permanent until the hair is trimmed or
cut.  Neither  form affects rugs, furs, or any other hair or  fur  not  on  a
living body. Unwilling targets get a saving throw versus spell.

      This  is a particularly annoying and potentially disgusting spell.  The
caster places his hands upon the bare flesh of the victim and immediately the
victim takes 1d4-1 damage per level of the caster (a successful saving  throw
negates the effect). Large, pussy blisters grow from the place the victim was
touched.  This  can have any number of ill effects upon the victim  depending
upon the location and the creativity of the DM.

The material component of this spell is some lamp oil rubbed on the hands  of
the caster.

Anyone  paying attention to the wizard is entitled to a saving  throw  versus
spell.  If  the saving throw succeeds, they realise that they cannot  discern
some  detail  in  the wizard's face; careful attention will then  negate  the
spell.  A  dispel  illusion  will cancel the  spell  entirely.  The  material

This  spell  works as a sort of slow poison or disease or curse.  The  caster
casts  the  spell upon the damaging portion of a weapon, and when the  weapon
does damage to someone the spell is used. The victim takes 2 HP of damage for
every  three  levels  of the caster every round. The  wound  stays  open  and
festering no matter how much dressing or medical care is given to it. While a
cure  spell will heal the damage, the wound is still there and will  continue
to  plague the victim. The only way to get rid of the effect is to first cast
remove curse and then cure disease on the victim.

The  material component is a piece of rotten meat rubbed on the weapon as the
spell is cast.

When this spell is cast, a chosen object held by the caster will radiate wild
magic. The next time the object is touched (even by the caster), a wild surge
is  triggered.  The effective level of the caster is added to the  percentile
roll,  as  per Nahal's reckless dweomer, but no luck magic such as  Hornung's
surge  selector applies to this surge (as the caster may not  be  present  to
select  the  surge). Any surge that indicates that the intended  spell  takes
effect  will  not  have any effect. The object or creature that  touched  the
object  is  treated as the target of the surge, while the  object  itself  is
treated as the caster.

This  spell  causes  the caster's body to radiate wild  magic.  Whenever  the
caster  is  hit  for damage in melee, a wild surge is rolled.  The  effective

wild luck (see the Net Libram of Wild Magic) active on the caster at the time
of the surge may be applied. Any surge that indicates that the intended spell
takes  effect  will not have any effect. The material component  is  a  small

Once  this  spell is cast, a faintly visible 1d4+6 feet tall  vortex  appears
around  the wizard, centred on his feet. The vortex is a container for  spell
energy. It can store up to 1 spell level per level of the wizard. The  wizard
may  place any spell he wants into the vortex. He also has a chance equal  to
his magic resistance of catching a spell cast at him with the vortex.
After  the  spell's energy is stored in the vortex, the wizard  may  use  the
energy  to fire other spells from the vortex. He may only fire spells he  has
"taught"  the  vortex  though  (the ones he put  into  the  vortex  himself).
Shooting  a spell from the vortex may be accomplished once a round, plus  one
may be fired at anyone who casts a spell at the wizard that round. The wizard
may do anything except spell casting and still be able to fire all his spells
each round.

The  material component of this spell is a small golden box, worth  at  least
1000 gp.

When  the  wizard completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses his hand  and
then  shoots  forth, unerringly striking its target. This energy attacks  the
life force of any living creature. The creature must roll a successful saving
throw versus spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the wizard and
lose  1  point  of Strength per level of the wizard. If the saving  throw  is
successful,  the creature remains unharmed. Creatures not rated for  Strength
suffer  a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for every two wizard levels.  Lost
Strength  returns  at  a  rate  of 1 point per hour.  Damage  must  be  cured
magically or healed naturally over time.
This  spell  has a special effect on undead creatures. Undead struck  by  the
bolt  suffer  no  damage  or Strength loss, but they must  successfully  save
versus spell or flee for 1d4 rounds + 2 rounds per level of the wizard.

This  spell mimics the 4th-level fire trap in many respects. Unless otherwise
noted, follow the description of fire trap for effects.
This  spell  places  mystical runes over the area to be  warded.  Chance  for
detection  of  these  runes is as per detection of a fire  trap.  Anyone  not
attuned  to  these runes (as per fire trap) who disturbs them, will  cause  a
violent  explosion of negative planar energy which will sap life energy  from
all  in the area of effect. Damage is thus the same as per fire trap, but  as
the  damage  is not fire-based it is damaging only to living creatures.  This
spell has no altered effects underwater as does fire trap.

The material component for this spell is a bit of wraith or spectre essence.

This spell causes all hostile creatures within the spell's range to suffer  a
penalty to magic resistance checks of 5% per level of the wizard. The reverse
of  this spell, bestow magic resistance, confers magic resistance of  5%  per
level of the wizard on all friendly creatures within the spell's range.  Note
that  "friendly" refers to the perception of the wizard; thus, a party member
who  was secretly planning to stab the wizard in the back would still receive
protection from the spell. The material component of this spell is a  bit  of
gum.

This devotion allows the psionicist to actually block out one form
of  sensory  input.  Affected senses can be taste,  smell,  sight,
hearing, or one kind of touch (either pain, pressure, temperature,
or  hunger/thirst). While in effect, the victim is totally  unable
to  "comprehend" the sense, almost as if it was disconnected  from
his brain. As a result, standard curative magic will not work, but
remove  curse  might  (DM's discretion). Only  one  sense  can  be
affected  for  every  use of this power,  thus,  it  requires  two
separate  usages  to  make  a  person  deaf  and  blind.  Standard
penalties apply to blindness and deafness; loss of taste  prevents
the  victim from being able to taste anything (including  spoilage
or  poison), loss of smell prevents the victim from smelling smoke
or  a  the  stench of various monsters (including troglodytes  and
ghasts).  In  terms of loss of touch, inhibiting pain  prevents  a
character  from knowing how many hit points he's lost,  inhibiting
pressure  causes the person's body to become numb (-2 on  attacks,
movement  at 1/2 movement rate, DEX checks may be needed  at  DM's
discretion  to prevent falling or dropping something),  inhibiting
temperature  means  the person cannot tell  if  something  is  too
hot/cold  to handle (although after 7 points of heat/fire  damage,
pain begins, but the character might not know why), and inhibiting
hunger  and thirst means that the character does not realize  he's
hungry  or thirsty... and thus could starve to death at a banquet,
or be protected from an Insatiable Thirst spell.

Power Score:  Two senses can be negated for 6 points per round, or
one sense can be negated for 4 points per round.

20:   The  victim's  senses are not altered,  but  the  psionicist
thinks  the power worked. Also, the victim is protected  from  all
forms  of False Sensory Input and Negate Sensory Input, regardless
of who is projecting it.

This  combat  spell  projects a bolt of negative energy.  Some  practitioners
believe  it  to  be  merely energy from the negative material  plane...  Said
wizards are wrong.
The  spell  actually  projects raw anti-matter  in  a  bolt  of  anti-energy.
Materials  affected by the bolt tend to disintegrate and be  consumed.  Spell
wards  and  defences tend to dissolve also. Specific defences exist  for  the
genre  of  spells  similar to this one but they are secrets  kept  for  self-
defence.
The bolt only does 1d3 per level of the wizard but it also has the effect  of
dispelling 1st- and 2nd-level defensive spells. Spells of third through fifth
level need to make a saving throw based on that of their wizard to save,  and
6th-level spells only fail on a 1. The duration of any such affected spell is
usually  reduced on a ratio to the level of the spell (DM's  decision  as  to
what, though I wouldn't suggest more than half duration).

This spell creates a 15-foot diameter net that shoots forth from the caster's
hand  to wrap itself around all creatures in the area of effect. A successful
Dexterity  check  means the intended victim was able to dodge  the  net  (for
creatures, a saving throw versus spell would suffice). If the victim fails to
dodge  the  net, it wraps itself around them and goes tight. An edged  weapon
will  be able to cut through the net by doing 15 points of damage. Any  edged
weapon  longer  than  a  dagger  will only cause  half  damage,  because  the
entangled  person  will  not  be  able  to  move  well  enough  to  yield  it
successfully. A successful bend bars roll will also allow the victim to  tear
out  of  the  net. The openings through the weave of the net are very  small,
enabling it to trap any fish and animals larger than an inch around.
When  the spell duration expires, the net vanishes. The wizard can also  open
or  dispel  the  net at will. The material component for the spell  is  small
seaweed  net  adorned with silver clamps, worth 200 gp ready-made.  A  wizard
with  weaving  and metalworking proficiencies can create the net  himself  at
cost of materials.

This  spell will detoxify any poisonous gas. Any such gas within the area  of
effect  will  be  turned into a fine watery mist and be completely  harmless.
Even green dragon breath will be rendered harmless by this spell.
If  the  spell is cast upon an object or creature, the sphere will move  with
the  target. A target creature would get a saving throw versus spell to avoid
this effect if it is unwilling. If the target saves, the globe will centre in
the  nearby  area. Use the thrown missiles table in the Player's Handbook  to
determine where the spell actually centres. This may mean that the target  is
still in the area of effect until it moves.
The  reverse of this spell, poison gas, will create a cloud of poisonous  gas
which  will slay outright any creatures in the area of effect that are  under
2+1  HD.  All  other creatures must make a saving throw versus poison  at   2
every  round  that  they  stay in the cloud or die  in  1d3  rounds.  If  the
creatures make their saving throw for that round, the only take 3d6 points of
damage  instead. If the target creature had the spell cast upon  itself,  and
then had cast a slow poison, it only takes 1 point of damage per round.
Regardless of what version of the spell is cast, the priest's holy symbol and
a  sprig  of  belladonna  are  required to cast  the  spell.  The  belladonna
disappears after the spell is cast.

This enchantment is unusual because it is not cast directly at it victim, but
is  cast  upon  a medium of transferral. The spell can only be  cast  upon  a
prepared  alcoholic  drink (the mixing or pouring of  which  is  the  somatic
component),  not  on  an entire flask, bottle or keg of  alcohol.  The  spell
beneficiary is defined as the one who offers the enspelled drink  to  another
person.  The  beneficiary does not necessarily need to know  of  the  drink's
enchanted status, but to benefit from the enchantment must offer it  verbally
to  another  creature, who is the target of the spell. If the target  accepts
the  drink  and imbibes even a sip, the spell is activated and the target  is
instantly  affected. The victim no saving throw if it accepts the drink,  and
forcing a being to drink will negate the magic.
A  creature  affected  by the spell is then subject to a  specialized  charm,
which   persuades  it  to  willingly  and  enthusiastically  submit  to   the
recipient's  romantic  or sexual overtures. The charm lasts  for  exactly  24
hours,  after  which  time  the victim is free to  act  normally  toward  the
recipient, but will still believe that any actions made while the  charm  was
in  effect were made freely. The victim must be of a sexual orientation which
is compatible with the spell recipient.

      This  spell  was  created  by  the wizard NightShade,  after  a  prison
entrapment  left her unable to cast spells because she lacked  components.  A
similar  spell, conjure spell components (see the Tome of Magic for details),
was  introduced  a few years afterwards. The two are very similar,  but  each
have  their  advantages  and  disad  This  spell  causes  the  desired  spell
components  to appear directly into the wizard's hands. The component  cannot
be man-made or exceed 1 gp value. The wizard can call forth one component per
level. There are no restrictions in bringing forth animals or animal parts.

This dreadful spell causes its victims to suffer from wracking nightmares the
night  after it is cast, robbing them of any benefit of sleep. A saving throw
versus death magic negates the spell's effect.
If the saving throw is failed, the victim must make another saving throw each
following  night  with  a +2 cumulative bonus to avoid  recurrences.  Once  a
successful  saving  throw  has  been made, the nightmares  cease.  Since  the
recurring  nightmares are non-magical, the victim gets the  equivalent  of  1
hour of sleep per 2 hours.
If  another  nightmare spell is cast on a victim before he  has  successfully
saved  against  recurrences,  he must save at -4,  with  this  penalty  being
applied against his subsequent saving throws. This penalty is non-cumulative,
i.e., additional castings will not increase the penalty to worse than -4. The
material  component of this spell is a black mithril statuette of a nightmare
worth at least 100 gp per level of the wizard.

This spell is unusual even for a wild magic dweomer, and is cast by taking  a
huge swig of liquor (the material component) after saying the magic words. It
causes  a  strange type of drunkenness to overwhelm the caster. The  wizard's
state  of  intoxication is randomly determined every round, as per the  table
below:

     D100 Roll Intoxication Level
     01-25     Sober (normal)
     26-50     Slight (double effects)
     51-75     Moderate (triple effects)
     76-95     Great (quadruple effects)
     96-00     Incoherent (casting impossible)

Note that the chance of spell failure inherent to these states of drunkenness
(see  the  Net Alcohol Guide for more information) is changed by the  spell's
magic  to mean "chance of wild surge" instead. Spells which surge because  of
the  random sobriety will have the enhanced effects noted above. A wizard who
is  sober  will  act  and  cast  normally that  round.  A  wizard  in  slight
intoxication  will have a 25% chance of surging any spell,  but  suffers  all
other  side effects of drunkenness. Moderate intoxication means a 50%  chance
of  surging, with other side effects retained. Great intoxication will  cause
all  spells  cast to surge (rather than making casting impossible),  but  has
severe  side effects otherwise. Incoherent means that the wizard is in danger
of  passing out - if this is rolled twice in a row, then the wizard will fall
unconscious  for  1d4  rounds.  The  caster  will  not  know  his  level   of
intoxication,  unless  he  is  sober or  completely  unable  to  act  due  to
incoherentness.
A  side  benefit of this spell is that the wizard has a chance equal  to  the
chance  of  surging to be able to escape (usually by stumbling, otherwise  by
colourful  chaos-interference) any negative side effects of his  wild  surges
during  that round. Also, Nahal's Reckless Dweomer has triple chance to  cast
the  desired  spell  normally during rounds in which  the  caster  is  either
slightly or moderately intoxicated.

This  spell  brings  down a terrible curse upon the area  under  effect.  Any
creature who dies within the area of effect, and during the duration  of  the
spell, will arise as an undead creature of appropriate strength on the  night
of  the  next full moon, provided the duration does not end before  the  next
full moon. The material component is a piece of moonstone of at least 1 pound

This  spell, created by the wild mage Nikki Kell of Greyhawk, brings forth  a
human  berserker  fighter as the ultimate melee weapon  of  the  wizard.  The
berserker will battle endlessly until destroyed or the spell expires -  after
which  it  will  just simply vanish from existence. The berserker  cannot  be
dispelled  by any magical means, and cannot even be dismissed by the  wizard.
The  level of the berserker is determined randomly: 1d10 + 1 per 2 levels  of
the  caster  (round  up).  The berserker will have ability  scores  of  18/00
Strength,  18 Dexterity, 18 Constitution. Intelligence, Wisdom, and  Charisma
scores are irrelevant, as the fighter will be in a mindless rage and will not
stop  or  communicate  under  any circumstances. Hit  points  are  determined
randomly.  The berserker will have a natural Armour Class of  4,  with  a  -1
bonus  for  every  full 2 levels of the caster up to a maximum  total  Armour
Class  of -10. The berserker will appear with a weapon, which can be  decided
by  the wizard. The weapon will be a magical weapon, +3, which will disappear
with the berserker. The berserker is immune to all mind affecting spells  and
saves  at +4 to all other spells. Due the berserker rage, the fighter gets  a
+1  bonus  to-hit  and  a  +3 damage bonus - along with  magical  weapon  and
Strength bonus.
Of  course,  there  is a catch to this wild magic spell. The  berserker  will
attack  endlessly until the spell expires. If the wizard's  foes  are  killed
before  the  spell expires, the berserker will turn upon the caster  and  his
companions. As stated above, the wizard cannot end this spell by choice,  and
the  berserker  cannot be magically dispelled. The material  component  is  a
small, sharp piece of metal.

The  Magic  of Nilrem is a series of humorous spells made in AD&D 2nd-edition
format.  They aren't intended for game use, but if a DM has a real  sense  of
humour,  pertinent game information is included and they can be used as  both
priest and wizard spells.
By  means  of this spell, the caster can alter a certain amount of a powdered
substance (1 ounce per 2 levels of any powdery substance, usually talcum or a
similar powder) to cause an incredible itching sensation and irritation  when
coming  in  contact  with a creature's skin. The creature  cannot  fight  the
desire  to itch and the sensation continues (and actually gets worse  as  the
creature scratches) for the duration of spell, after which the magical powder
reverts  to its original form. The magic powder can be stored for any  length
of  time  until  use and can be removed by magical means or a  dispel  magic.
Otherwise,  the powder fuses itself into the creature's skin  and  cannot  be
removed  by  conventional  means.  The saving  throw  the  creature  gets  is
determined by the circumstances under which the caster (or whomever)  applies
it.  It  is  normally  applied covertly, but can be dropped  on,  thrown  at,
applied  on,  etc. the creature with or without its knowledge.  The  material
component of this spell is the powder to be used.

The  Magic  of Nilrem is a series of humorous spells made in AD&D 2nd-edition
format.  They aren't intended for game use, but if a DM has a real  sense  of
humour, pertinent game information is included.
When  a  wizard  casts  Nilrem's overflowing kidneys, the  affected  creature
begins to get the urge to relieve itself. This urge builds considerably until
becoming overwhelming by the fifth round when the creature has no choice  but
to  relieve  itself. The effect of this spell is twofold since the  creature,
while  under  the  spell's influence, is unable to make completely  effective
manoeuvres.  The  creature receives a  2 penalty to Dexterity,   1  for  each
round until relieved and is unable to cast spells because of the considerable
strain  necessary to keep itself from answering nature's call.  The  material
component  of this spell is a container (goblet, chalice, etc.) of  at  least
100  gp  in  value  filled with water that must be splashed on  the  creature
during casting.

This  is an extremely complex spell requiring significant preparation  before
casting.  First, an ornate, rune-encrusted stone archway must be built,  with
an iron door hinged therein, the cost of constructing this being no less than
10,000  gp.  The  runes follow a prescribed pattern,  but  the  door  may  be
decorated  as  the  designer wills. The spell is then cast,  and  during  the
process the wizard must not be interrupted. This infuses the arch (and  door)
with the proper magics. Included in this casting is a specialized form of the
permanency  spell. When the spell is finished, the door may  then  be  opened
into  an extradimensional space of extensive volume: 10 cubic yards per level
of  the caster, in a simple shape of the caster's choosing. No complex  forms
may  be made; thus, cubes, domes, and other simple, continuous shapes are the
only possibilities. The space is featureless and black; not even the edges of
its  "walls"  are visible, although they are certainly solid  to  the  touch.
However,  since  the  space  is permanent and stable,  the  wizard  can  have
facilities built within, regardless of the weight brought inside.  Note  that
it  does not matter where the arch is set up, in the side of a wall, or  even
free-standing,  it  is  only  accessible  from  one  side,  the  other  being
featureless  stone.  Also,  note that other extradimensional  spaces  may  be
brought herein; the door will not open for someone carrying such a space,  be
it  a  bag  of  holding, a portable hole, or even a deeppockets  spell  whose
duration  has  not yet lapsed. The space maintains the last  temperature  and
atmosphere  verbally  requested  by  the  wizard,  the  environment  shifting
instantly,  with  conditions anywhere between 0 and 120  F,  with  atmosphere
ranging  from  high-altitude to thick, sea-level,  from  extremely  foggy  to
pristine,  and  from  muggy to desert-dry. Note that  deadly  conditions  and
extreme  weather  may  not  be set up herein. Many  other  spells  favourably
interact  with  the Nilspace's make-up; notably unseen servant,  magic  mouth
(reprogrammable in this case), invisibility (on the door), guards  and  wards
(switchable),  and  others,  including  Darklight's  mysterious   manservant.
Incorporating  such  a  spell  into  the  fabric  of  the  Nilsparequires  an
additional  hour  of  casting during the creation of the  space,  along  with
another 1,000 gp of craftsmanship on the arch. Another method is to cast  the
spell  to  be incorporated with the assistance of certain special components,
different  for each spell, but uniformly rare or expensive. The  incorporated
spells  are  permanent within the nilspace and are usually  "user  friendly",
such  as  the reprogrammable magic mouth mentioned above; the DM must  decide
what  spells may be treated this way, but no offensive or healing magics will
take  hold (typically the spells are utilitarian in nature and of low power).
Destruction of a nilspace is extremely difficult and requires the  equivalent
of a wish. The spell was created by the wizard Darklight.

This  spell  can only be cast on a staff of not more than 8 feet  in  length.
When  a  staff is so enchanted, it will, upon command, shoot forth  lines  of
force  from  both ends perpendicular to the length of the staff  and  in  the
direction the caster desires. These lines will extend up to a maximum of  150
feet,  and will attach to any inanimate non-living object (usually a wall  or
ceiling).  The  wizard  can then control the length of  the  lines  at  will,
although they cannot pull an object faster than 5 feet per second. The  lines
can  hold a maximum of 40 pounds per level of the caster. If the strength  of
the  lines  is exceeded, they will immediately vanish. After the  lines  have
attached to something they will remain attached until their strength has been
exceeded,  they are dismissed by the caster, they are dispelled by  a  dispel
magic spell, or after a period of 24 hours (whichever comes first). Each time
this  spell is cast upon a staff, up to three sets of lines of force  can  be
conjured as long as they are called within 8 hours per level of the caster. A
staff  can  have only one of these spells cast upon it at a time  (subsequent
castings will not add more charges).

All  creatures within the area effect at the time of casting will have  their
hearing  muted  -  they will not hear anything unless they  have  some  other
confirmation  of its existence. Thus, you can only hear people speak  if  you
can  see  their  face or know precisely what they will say; background  noise
will  continue if you know it should be there but sudden noises from the next
room will not be heard, etc. Once a creature notices or becomes suspicious of
the effect (by turning around and seeing a large pile of broken crockery they
did  not  hear  break, for example), it will automatically be dispelled  with
respect to that creature. The material component is a pair of blinders.

When  this  spell  is  cast,  the wizard raises his  hands  to  the  sky  and
starsinging. As soon as he does this, a choir of beautiful elven voices joins
in  the song and keeps singing for the duration of the spell, or until it  is
ended by the caster or dispelled.
Creatures within hearing range of the song (the volume is about as high as  a
normal choir) must make a saving throw versus spell with adjustments for high
or low Wisdon, plus the following modifiers:

Creature is... Modifier
within 10 yards of casting point   None
within 20 yards of casting point   +2 bonus
within 30 yards of casting point   +3 bonus
30+ yards from casting point  +4 bonus
elven*    None
human     -1 penalty
goblinoid (orc, goblin, hobgoblin, ogre, etc.)    +1 bonus
animal intelligence +2 bonus
deaf Unaffected
non-intelligent (0) Unaffected
* Elves still get their magic resistance check.

The  area of effect stays in the same spot as it was cast, and does not  move
with the caster if he decides to walk away. The maximum area of effect is  as
far  as  the DM decides it is possible to clearly hear the song. This  is  of
course  modified by weather conditions, noise in the area and  anything  else
the  DM  thinks appropriate. For example it might be impossible to  hear  the
spell  beyond 5 yards in a storm, this would mean that nothing beyond 5 yards
from  the  casting point would be affected, it would also here be appropriate
to  give the saving throw bonus of +4, or maybe even higher if the DM  thinks
it appropriate. The modifiers above assume relatively normal conditions.
A  creature failing the saving throw stops whatever it was doing to listen to
the  singing.  Anyone so affected who is attacked must make  a  saving  throw
versus  spell with a -4 penalty. If he makes the saving throw, the  spell  is
broken  and  he may act normally; if not, he still defends himself  from  his
attacker, but only half-heartedly (no bonuses for Dexterity or Strength,  but
penalties still apply), the THAC0 of a character half his level (round down),
thief  skills function at half effectiveness. And to cast a spell one has  to
make  a  saving throw versus spell modified by Wisdom, if it fails the caster
fails to concentrate properly and the spell is wasted. All proficiency checks
are  made with a -4 penalty). Allies of the caster receive a +1 bonus to  to-
hit rolls, initiative, saving throws, proficiency checks and Armour Class.
At the end of the spell all enemies of the caster still affected by the spell
makes  another  saving  throw versus spell with a +4 bonus  and  adjusted  by
Wisdom.  If  they fail the saving throw they are affected as by  a  confusion
spell  for 1d6 rounds. The caster need not be singing for more than the first
round. If he does continue though all saving throws are further adjusted by a
-1  penalty (enemies) or a +1 bonus (allies) for as long as he keeps  singing
(within  the  duration of the spell). This takes concentration, so  no  other
actions may be taken by the caster in that round.

The  material  component  for this spell is a small platinum  figurine  of  a
songbird worth 100 gp. The figurine crumbles to dust at the moment the  spell
ends.

This  spell enables the wizard to impregnate the recipient, be it man, women,
or  beast,  with either the prodigy of the wizard, or a type  I  or  type  II
monster of choice.
The impregnation forms anywhere on the creature, just under the skin. Over  a
period  of  one  month  the impregnation grows, causing  great  pain  to  the
recipient. The damage is 1 HP per day for the first 23 days and 2 HP per  day
for the next 4 days. On the 28th day the impregnation breaks through the skin
of  the spell recipient, doing 5d4 HP of damage, and appears as an infant  of
the creature chosen.
Physically removing the impregnation prematurely instantly kills it but  also
does  4d4 HP damage to the recipient. Dispel evil cast in the first  week  of
impregnation will eliminate the effect.
The wizard needs to know only the name of the recipient and must possess some
material  of  the type of creature being created and some material  that  was
possessed by the spell recipient (which includes hair, etc.) within 24  hours
of casting.

When  this  spell  is  cast,  a cold, black fire appears  in  wizard's  hand,
shedding violet coloured light equivalent to torchlight. The wizard can  hold
the  blackfire without taking damage or throw it at an opponent. Throwing  it
at an opponent requires a roll to hit. If the sphere hits, the target ignites
the  creature's life force doing 1d6 points of damage the first round and 1d3
the  following  rounds until extinguished. The flames can be extinguished  by
padding  them  out, but water has no effect. The flames only  consume  living
matter  (creatures and plants) and have no effect on non-living  material  or
undead.  The  end product of blackfire combustion is oxygen and  a  grey-blue
ash.

The material components are human fat and powdered magnesium.

When  this spell is cast, a clear mucous-like substance rains down  upon  the
area  of effect for one round, in which it reaches a depth of four feet.  Any
creature  in the area of effect must save versus spell or be knocked  to  the
ground  by  globs  of  slime and must take 1d3 rounds to regain  their  feet.
Movement through the slime is 10 feet per round and it is 50% probable that a
creature  trying  to move in the area slips and falls. Creatures  with  their
head(s)  beneath the slime must make a Constitution check each round or  take
1d4 points of drowning damage.
Dispel  magic,  disintegrate, or transmute water to dust will  eliminate  the
endoplasmic  quagmire. The material components are a piece  of  flesh,  taken
from  a  human  within one round after death, and a vial of organic  material
rotten to the point of liquidity.

Upon casting this spell the recipient and all his belongings are reduced to a
heap  of  dust with a skull resting on top. The skull is actually a  conjured
one and is not attached to the spell recipient in any way. The conjured skull
may  or  may  not  be human, but will always be humanoid (cf. reincarnation).
Feigning creatures are able to smell and hear normally, but can only see in a
20-foot radius sphere around themselves.
Creatures  feigning  dust  are  unaffected by  any  attack  form  other  than
scattering  by magical means (wind wall, gust of wind, polymorph any  object,
etc.),which  cause  1d6 HP damage per level of the caster of  the  scattering
spell. Attempts to remove the dust by other means will not succeed.

Ghoul  arrow brings into being one bolt of negative energy for every 5 levels
of  the  wizard. Each bolt can have a different target. Each bolt forms  into
three  vaguely  arrow  shaped  projectiles that  hurl  towards  the  wizard's
opponent.  The arrows never miss their target and inflict 1d6, 1d3,  and  1d3
points  of  damage  respectively.  The affected  creature  must  save  versus
paralysation  or  be paralysed in the areas hit by each of the  arrows.  Roll
1d6:

     D6 Roll   Area Hit
     1    left leg
     2    right leg
     3    left arm
     4    right arm
     5 or 6    body

Limbs paralysed are rendered useless. Body paralysis eliminates any Dexterity
bonus and results in the victim always acting at initiative 10. The paralysis
lasts for 1d6+1 rounds.

The  material components are a handful of ghoul flesh and a drop of  humanoid
blood.

This  spell  enables the wizard to convert his mount into a  gruesome  undead
creature.  The  mount is allowed a saving throw versus death magic.  If  this
saving  throw fails the mount must make a system shock roll, and if it  fails
this roll it dies before the spell is completed, thereby negating the effects
of the spell.
The  mount turns jet-black with glowing red eyes and appears as if  its  skin
was  pulled  tightly  over  its  bones. The  mounts  skin  becomes  leathery,
decreasing  its  Armour  Class by 2. It acquires an additional  Hit  Die  and
retains  its previous movement rate and form (i.e., flying mounts  can  still
fly).  The  mounts maximum encumbrance increases by 200 pounds  and  it  also
never grows tired.
The  wizard  needs a vial made from the bones of a creature the same  as  the
mount. The vial must be filled with demon ichor.

This  spell  causes a major disease and weakness in one or more creatures  in
the  same way as the contagion spell. Up to one creature per experience level
of the wizard can be affected, provided that all subject creatures are within
the spell range.
The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting
symptoms:  boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on.  Strength,
Dexterity,  and Charisma are reduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased  by  2.
The effect persists until the character receives a cure disease or spends 1d3
weeks  taking  a  complete  rest  to recover. Characters  ignoring  the  mass
contagion  for more than a day or so may be susceptible to worse diseases  at
the discretion of the DM.
Saving  throws  against the spell suffer a penalty of -1,  and  if  a  single
creature is to be affected, its saving throw suffers a -4 penalty.

This  spell will slay a selected type of creature in the designated  area  of
effect  with the effectiveness of a double-strength death spell (with respect
to numbers of creatures slain). For example, all the first born of a specific
race could be slain in the area of effect.
During  the  6  hour casting time, black storm clouds form over the  wizard's
location and slowly pillar to the ground. Upon completion of the casting  the
cloud  touches  the ground and vanishes and the selected group  of  creatures
slowly dies over a one-round period.
The first material component is a blade of grass from the grave of a creature
of  the type to be selected. The single blade of grass must be picked in  the
direct light of a full moon. The second material component is 5,000 gp  worth
of powdered diamond.

      With  this cantrip, the wizard can put himself into a trance-like state
in  which  he  is  highly aware of the details of his surroundings.  For  the
duration  of  the trance, the wizard is at +2 perception (or +4 if  there  is
something  particular he is looking for), but cannot take any actions.  Also,
he  loses any Dexterity bonus to Armour Class and takes a further -2 penalty,
and  is  likely to ignore most attempts at communicating with him. The wizard
can  break  the trance at any time, and can do so in response to a remark  he
"didn't  hear",  an impending attack, or whatever - it is  assumed  that  his
subconscious will snap him out if really necessary.

By  means  of  this  spell, the priest sets down a magical  contract  between
himself  and  some other individual, which cannot be broken by  either  party
except where conditions of punishment are specifically agreed upon. All  that
is  necessary is that the two parties somehow be in communication, have  full
understanding of the agreement, and that both willingly accept it. Because of
the  nature of the magic, oaths which are not clear and well defined tend  to
end  in  disaster  for  both parties. The oath may only  be  "unbound"  if  a
condition was set for its unbinding within the magical contract.

Oathbreaker is a powerful method of obtaining vengeance for a fallen comrade.
The  deceased person must have been known to the priest, and must  have  been
killed  through the treachery of the intended target of the spell.  That  is,
the  target must have violated an oath or agreement with the deceased  person
(king to subject, guest to host, etc.), or conspired to bring about the death
of the deceased.
Casting  oathbreaker begins with the priest bringing out an object that  used
to  be in the deceased's possession (which is the material component of  this
spell),  naming the deceased, and detailing the treachery which  resulted  in
his  death.  Thereafter,  two huge columns appear in  front  of  the  priest.
Between the columns appears a great door. The priest then knocks on the  door
thrice,  names  the deceased, and pulls open the doors. The  deceased  person
then steps through the door as a special undead creature.
The  deceased comes back in a near corporeal form which mimics  his  form  in
life. The spirit has the same hit points as it did in life, and appear as  it
did  in  life.  Although the spirit appears unarmoured, is affected  only  by
magical  weapons  of  +2 or better enchantment. The spirit  has  50%  magical
resistance,  and  is unaffected by sleep, charm, and other  forms  of  mental
control.  It  can attack adversaries as a spectre, and can cast  revisitation
any  time  it comes within range of the person responsible for its death.  In
any  case,  the spirit's only purpose is to seek out and destroy  the  person
responsible for its death; the spirit will exist only as long as  the  target
remains alive.
If  the  spirit is slain with magical weapons, or is dispelled (for which  it
gets  a  saving throw versus spell as it would have in life) it can never  be
raised from the dead again, except by a wish.

This  spell  places the equivalent of an improved stoneskin  around  any  one
object.  Thus,  the  object cannot be cut, torn, or ripped,  even  by  weapon
attacks. The spell can be cast upon both magical and non-magical objects. The
object  cannot be bigger than 1 cubic foot per level of the spellcaster,  nor
can  it weigh more than 10 pounds per level of the spellcaster. Further,  the
spell cannot be used to protect only part of an object so as to overcome  the
volume  and  weight  limit (the spellcaster cannot  use  multiple  spells  to
fortify  the entire outer wall of his keep). The protection lasts  until  the
object  is  hit a number of times equal to 1d4+1 per 2 levels  of  the  spell
caster.  Further,  the object saves versus spell as the  equivalent  of  hard
metal  or hard stone, whichever is better. Note that if the object's  natural
saving  throw  is better than either of the above two, then it saves  against
that  instead.  All magical bonuses apply against whichever saving  throw  is
used.  The spell does not increase the damage inflicted by a weapon if it  is
cast upon one.

The  material component is a small piece of steel, which is consumed when the
spell is cast.

All creatures not casting the priest at the culmination of this spell will be
subject to it. Any break in concentration during the day will fail the spell.
The priest can do nothing but concentrate on the spell. At the culmination of
the  spell,  all  life  in the area of effect is destroyed.  Trees,  animals,
insects, humans, tarrasques, demons and microbes are all wiped out. No  trace
of  any life is found. Structures within the area may survive. This spell can
only  be  granted to a priest of death (note: be careful with this  spell.  I
don't need to tell you how powerful it can be). If the priest's concentration
is  broken during the casting, the spell will fail, and the priest  must  ask
for the spell again from his deity. Obviously the deity will not be as likely
to give the spell. Any other priests of death near the priest may join hands,
and  concentrate  with the priest for the casting time.  If  they  do,  their
levels  will  be  added  to  the  priest's for consideration  of  range.  Any
creatures  within the range of the spell are forever lost. Not even  a  deity
may  bring  them back. Any demi-god caught in the spell effect  must  roll  a
saving  throw  versus death magic or be irreversibly destroyed.  Greater  and
lesser gods are immune. After casting the spell, the priest will fall into  a
coma  for 13 days. Upon waking from the coma, all statistics will be  3,  and
they  will be regained at the rate of 1 point per day. No sacrifice is needed
after  this spell, because the massive loss of life in the area is more  than
enough  to  please  a  deity of death. The user of  the  spell  may  be  held
responsible  for its effects by any rangers, druids, or even  cults  entirely
wiped  out by the spell effect. Vast armies chasing after the caster  is  not
considered rare. The deity will not specifically assist the priest in dealing
with the consequences of the spell, but he will not hold back on spells.  The
only time the deity will intervene is if another god sees fit to divulge  his
wrath  upon the caster. In which case the deity will appear to fight off  the
other deity, or avatars sent by the other deity.
Obviously  the caster must be of absolute alignment, in extreme  favour  with
his deity, and most likely will have to be the most powerful death priest  on
the  continent (except in special DM cases). Misuse of this spell is  frowned
upon, to say the least.

This   power   is   remarkably like superior invisibility,  except
that  it covers the smell, sound, and sight of the ash surrounding
the defiler.   The power score decreases by one however, per level
of  the spell  being  cast.   So  a  fourth  level  spell  will be
at  INT -8.  However,  if a person comes back to the defiled  area
at a later date, he/she  will  notice  the  defiled  area,  unless
cloaked by another talent.

Power  Score:  Every time the people affected by this  spell  come
back  to this particular spot, they will not see the area of  ash.
Ever.

20:  They know exactly what is going on, and the Defiler is in BIG
trouble.

A  person  under the effect of obsession is overwhelmed by the erotic  desire
for  some animate creature chosen by the spellcaster. A "crush" does not even
begin  to  describe the effect. The creature must be such that  the  affected
person might feel some attraction towards it under normal circumstances,  and
the  affected  person will not act contrary to alignment or personal  ethics.
The material component is a crushed walnut.

Offensive  summoning is a very specific type of summoning. The only  eligible
targets are those which have done the priest an unredressed wrong. The priest
concentrates  upon the target, the injury, or the target's name,  and  speaks
the desired range. The target is then brought to anywhere within 40 yards  of
the  priest (priest's option). The first round after the offensive  summoning
is complete, the target appears and will be quite surprised.
If  the  target  has more Hit Dice or levels than the casting priest,  he  is
given  a  saving throw versus spell. If the saving throw is made, the  priest
and anyone touching the priest is transported to the location of the target.
In  order  for this spell to work, the priest and target must be on the  same
plane.  No  creature of demigod or greater status is ever  summoned  in  this
fashion.

dream.   The psionicist must be in a dream to use this power  (her
own dream or any dream affected by enter dream).
      Unwilling subject may choose to end the dream and  wake  up.
This action ends the dream for that particular character only.
     It should be noted that this is NOT a Dreamer power.  It does
not affect Dreamland characters, as they are out of reach of a non-
Dreamland psionicist.

Power Score:  A hostile monster is brought in instead.

20:  Unwilling subjects can be brought in.  They can only wake  up
if they make a saving throw vs. Paralyzation.

This  spell summons a puddle of ooze about 10 feet in diameter. The ooze hits
three  times  for corrosion damage. This does 1d2 to normal  flesh.  It  also
corrodes  any  metal in 4 rounds. Magical items are immune to this  creature.
Wood  and cloth are destroyed instantly however. The ooze has 3 HD, and moves
20  feet per round. Any elemental from the planes of earth, water or ooze can
dispel it with a touch, including another ooze puddle. The material component
for this spell is some custard.

This  spell  may be worked upon a single, magically-sealed tome, causing  the
tome  in  question  to  open at the final utterance  of  the  spell's  verbal
components: "Edro!". Note that a name which the book recognizes  as  its  own
must  be  known  by  the  wizard  in order to effect  this  spell.  Generally
speaking, a book which wants to stay shut may save versus spell at the  level
of  its  writer to avoid being opened, but special conditions  may  apply  to
this,  furthermore,  very  special books may be equipped  with  more  magical
protection, such as the sigil of the author or powerful runes and wards. Some
diamond dust must be sprinkled on the book for the spell to take effect.

When  this  spell  is  cast, a shimmering doorway  appears.  Beyond  it,  the
characters  can  see  a  blinding white light.  The  caster,  and  any  other
character, can step through and find themselves in another time stream.  This
is  a one-way trip. The opening is only accessible in the time stream it  was
created.
The  caster can choose to link the portal to the time stream adjacent to  the
one  in  which  he  finds himself, or can choose to access a  stream  as  far
removed  up to his number of levels. Additionally, the caster can  choose  to
enter  the time stream at any point in the past or future within a number  of
decades equal to his level.
The  portal  remains  open until the duration is up, or the  reverse  of  the
spell,  close time portal, is cast at a level equal to or higher to the  time
spirit that opened the portal.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for
more information on this class.

This spell causes the affected creature to reach a complete state of physical
elation.  The orgasm may last for up to the length of the spell.  The  victim
will  be very noisy while under the effect of the spell, and is considered  a
prone target with respect to physical attacks.
Saving  throws  are  at  victim's level - wizard's level.  A  one  is  always
considered  a failure for the wizard and success for the victim. The  reverse
of this spell, headache, will instantly bring the victim back from a state of
delirium to the harsh reality.

The  material component for the spell is a drop of sweat, for the reverse  it
is a hammer, which is not consumed in the casting.

This  spell allows the caster to animate man-sized paper constructs that have
been  designed using the art of origami. If the caster has created  these  by
hand,  10 constructs may be animated with one casting of this spell,  but  if
the  work  of  another is animated, then only 5 may be affected.  This  spell
allows  the  normal  movement functions of the creature  so  depicted  to  be
enacted  by  the construct, therefore, a humanoid construct could walk,  sit,
stand, lie down, kneel, etc., whereas a bird could fly or walk, or any  water
creature could swim. Of course, the paper would have to be heavy-duty  or  it
would  become  soggy  and fall apart, ending the spell  for  that  particular
construct. Each construct may carry one person or thing, up to 150 pounds  on
land  or  in air, 200 pounds on or in water (buoyancy). Since runes and  such
must  be notched upon these constructs prior to the casting of the spell,  if
the  caster  (origamist) is also skilled in calligraphy, then the calligraphy
can  be used to achieve this, producing a 50% bonus to the parameters: number
of constructs now is 7 or 15, 75-foot radius allowance, 1« hours per level of
the  caster duration, and weight allowance of 225 pounds (on land or in  air)
and  300  pounds (on or in water). The range value of special means that  any
number  of constructs up to his maximum number of constructs that the  caster
touches after casting the spell within the spell's duration will be animated.
So, if he has one at home that flies, he may animate one to carry him home on
land,  get  home,  then  animate the one at home for  the  remainder  of  the
duration of the spell in order to fly.
The animations are treated as Armour Class 6 unless their speed improves them
to  something better. They do not attack on the behalf of the caster  or  his
party;  they  are  merely transport. These constructs are  also  particularly
vulnerable  to  fire  -  quadruple damage. Slash weapons  do  double  damage.
Piercing  weapons do almost normal damage, -2 from the total; bludgeoning  or
bashing  types  do no damage; the paper merely gives way beneath  the  weapon
then springs back.
If the caster wishes, he may undertake to simply create a large, all-purpose,
party-carrying sized animation. The number of passengers the creation carries
is  be  subtracted from the total number of creations he could have animated.
So, if the limit is five, he may animate a four-person dragon structure and a
one-person  flying serpent creation, or whatever. The number  of  hit  points
deemed  necessary to destroy a construct is equal to twice the level  of  the
caster  plus  3  times  the number of people it can carry  plus  one  of  the
following:
          3 points if the origamist made them; no calligraphy involved
          5 points if the wizard made them; no calligraphy involved
          7 points if the wizard did either the origami or the calligraphy
          10 points if the wizard did both the origami and the calligraphy
Manoeuvrability and flying class, base move, etc., are all determined as  per
that  which it mimics. For every extra pair of passengers it carries,  reduce
its  value  by one category (180  manoeuvrability becomes 120 )  and  by  one
value  (base MV 12 to base MV 11). This means: reduce it once if it can carry
3-4  people,  twice if 5-6, thrice at 7-8, etc. The constructs can  be  given
simple  instructions, such as "go to Castletowne" or "fly north  until  dusk,
then  land at the closest village". Without such guidelines, the wizard  must
remain  in conscious control of the construct; it will collapse, waiting,  if
not. He can control the speed up to its maximum, change its course, etc.,  at
whim,  all as long as the spell is in effect. He may renew the spell for  any
construct within the area of effect - any construct previously activated that
is  still within 50 feet (or 75 feet) of himself - these need not be  touched
in  order  to  renew  the duration. Leaving the area of  effect  reduces  all
remaining duration by half for that particular construct.
Note  that  it  takes  3  full days plus one day per passenger  size  of  the
construct  to  make one and the same amount of time for the  calligraphy,  if
used.  No  other  activity may be pursued during this time,  besides  eating,
drinking, and sleeping. Note also that one need not be skilled in origami  to
make  an origami construct, it will simply be less effective in some fashion,
but  that  it  is  mandatory to have someone skilled in calligraphy  or  that
portion  of  the  spell will not function; in fact, it  may  be  detrimental,
causing a reduction or even backfire (the Killer Swan of Animated Attack)  if
someone unskilled attempts to scrawl all over the construct.
Bonuses or penalties may be given for the following, at discretion:
          Special inks for the calligraphy may grant bonus speed.
          Heavy-duty paper may have bonus hit points, crpe fewer.
           Various  coloured  papers may be used, giving life-like  effect  -
viewers  must  save  versus spell or believe it to be  real  (Wisdom  bonuses
apply).
          Hasty cut-and-paste tcreations may be made in a third of the normal
time,  with  no  calligraphy, but are severely restricted  (no  more  than  3
creations or passengers, a quarter duration, etc.).
           One spell level per experience level of the caster may be included
in  the  creation of the construct by using scrolls as part of it; the caster
may  cast the spells as if he were reading the scroll while in control of and
in  contact with that particular construct; this doesn't take away  from  the
mage's  concentration if trying to maintain moment-to-moment control  of  the
construct. These spells do not disappear after casting, but rather, become  a
permanent part of the construct. This is usable only after origami  anime  is
in effect on the construct and the caster is in contact with the creature.
           Extra abilities may be given to those constructs whose papers  had
been soaked and dried in various potions, such as fire resistance.

This spell enables the wizard to absorb and redirect up to 10 levels of magic
energy.  Any incoming spell is nullified, and the energy stored as potential.
Only  the  same spell can be redirected, even if the wizard is  not  familiar
with  it. Any type of spell directed at the wizard may be absorbed, with  the
exception  of  area  of effect spells, touch spells, and effects  from  magic
items. Unused stored energy is lost at the end of the spell's duration.
If  an incoming spell exceeds the spell's remaining capacity, the wizard  may
make  a  saving  throw  versus spell (with a bonus of +2  per  level  of  the
incoming spell absorbed), to avoid the effects of any remaining spell energy,
even for spells that ordinarily do not allow saving throws.

The  material component is an amulet that glows when spell energy  is  stored
then disintegrates on the ending of the spell.

When  this  spell is cast, it causes a cone shaped area, originating  at  the
wizard's  hand and extending outward into a cone, 5 yards long per  level  of
the  wizard.  It drains coldness and causes 1d4 HP + 1 HP per  level  of  the
wizard of acid damage. Furthermore, every round hereafter, the remaining acid
on  the target causes an additional 1d6 HP of acid damage, that is reduced by
1 every following round.

The  material component for the spell is a very small cone made  of  crystal,

This  spell  allows the wizard and 1d6 beings to travel the circuits  of  the
woven dimensions. The wizard can travel to the different realms or dimensions
and  back  with this spell. The duration of the spell is completely dependent
upon  the  will  of  the  wizard, with a maximum of 2  days.  The  number  of
creatures that can accompany the wizard should be rolled secretly by the  DM,
and  only  revealed  after  the first dimension  travel  has  been  made.  No
creatures  other than those that accompanied the wizard on the  first  travel
can accompany him on subsequent travels. Any unwilling creature gets a saving
throw versus spell to avoid the effects of this spell.

The material component for this spell is a brazier burning various rare herbs
during the casting of the spell.

When  this spell is cast, three bolts of fire, electricity, frost, water,  or
acid  shoot  forth from the palm of the wizard. They may strike one,  two  or
three  targets. If more than one target is struck, the targets must be within
60   of  each  other. The damage inflicted is 1d6 HP + 1 HP  per  level.  The
wizard  must be able to see the targets. Successful saving throws  halve  the
damage.  A saving throw applies to each separate bolt so if only one creature
is attacked then it must make three saving throws.

The material component for this spell is a small piece of gold shaped like  a
pyramid.

This  spell  creates  1d20 pieces of bubble gum that will  never  lose  their
substance or flavour. The gum will always be juicy and flavourful, and  never
sticky,  no  matter  how long it has been chewed. The  gum  is  meant  to  be
permanent  so it cannot be thrown away or swallowed. It can be rewrapped  and
saved, but never discarded.

The  material  component for this spell is a piece of fruit to represent  the
flavour.

This  spell  allows  the recipient and gear he carries  to  assume  solid  or
gaseous form, at will, for the duration of the spell. Each change requires  a
full  round,  with  no  other  actions  permitted.  Orko's  gaseous  form  is
transparent  and insubstantial and flows at a base speed of 3  per  round.  A
creature in gaseous form cannot be harmed by magical fires or lightning,  but
air attacks cause double damage.

This  spell  creates  a jet of steaming water, that extends  60  yards  in  a
straight line and is 5 yards wide, from the wizard's hand. All fires,  normal
and  magical,  will be extinguished. Any creature struck by the  stream  must
save versus petrification at a -1 or be blinded until the stream is moved  or
stopped.  Regardless of the saving throw, there will be a substantial  amount
of damage done, due to the heat (2d6 HP of damage). The material component of
this spell is a drop of water.

wizard  can  choose  to  alter the colour of the marker  if  he  wishes.  The

Upon  utterance  of this spell the wizard releases a light beam  of  positive
energy from his finger. The beam inflicts a total of 10d10 HP of damage,  and
if the saving throw versus spell is failed, there is a 20% chance that a body
part will be damaged (roll on the chart below if this is the case).

     D6 Roll   Hit  Effect
     1    Head Instant Death
     2 or 3    Arm  Useless until healed
     4 or 5    Leg  Useless until healed
     6    Rear Useless until healed

If  the  victim makes his saving throw he will sustain only half  damage  and
reduce  the  chance of body part damage to 5%. The only spell  component  for
this spell is a slight unique finger pattern.
It  is easier to aim at larger creatures, but a larger creature gets a better
saving throw. Therefore, range and saving throw for this spell vary according
to the creature attacked by the beam:

     Creature is    Range     Saving Throw
     Small     60 feet   «; made at -6
     Medium    120 feet  «; made at -4
     Large     240 feet  Negates

This spell has only somatic components.

When  cast on an individual creature, this spell gives the same effect as  an
ointment of slipperiness. If cast on a single object of 10 cubic feet  volume
of less, the object becomes impossible to grasp. Items held by creatures gain
a  saving  throw. If cast on a floor it will make a 2 x 2 yards  square  area
extremely  slick:  there  will be a 95% chance per round  that  any  creature
standing  in  the area will slip and fall. Fallen creatures must save  versus
spell to regain their footing or crawl out of the area at 1 yards per round.

The material component of this spell is powdered graphite.

Upon  the  utterance  of  the  spell,  the  wizard  creates  an  effect  that
drastically increases the target's health so that he will be able  to  resist
the  effects  of magic. The base magic resistance is 10% + 5%  per  level  of
experience.  The effects of the spell are identical to that of a person  that
would  naturally  have the resistance. All rules concerning magic  resistance
apply to this spell.

The  material component for this spell is a pinch of platinum in the form  of
dust.

This  spell  is  similar to the 4th-level Rary's mnemonic enhancer,  but,  by
means of this spell, the wizard is able to memorise and retain the memory  of
nine  additional spells, in different combinations. The wizard can  elect  to
memorise the spells immediately or the wizard may elect to retain the ability
to memorise the spells until a later time.

The material components for this spell are a piece of golden thread, an ivory
plaque  of at least 1000 gp, an ink compose of squid secretion and a drop  of
blue  dragon blood. All components disappear when the spell is cast. No spell
may be enhanced more than twice by means of this spell.

This spell is almost identical to the 8th-level wizard spell permanency, save
for  the fact that the wizard can make any spell's duration permanent (at the

While this spell is in effect, the wizard may use a gaze attack, exactly like
that of a basilisk, against one opponent every round. The gaze is in addition
to  normal  attacks and requires but 6 seconds to complete. The  victim  must
save versus petrification or be turned to stone. The gaze attack extends into
the  ethereal  plane, and the wizard is subject to the  effects  of  his  own
reflected gaze.

The material component is an ointment that includes powdered basilisk scales.

time.  The  wizard can travel into the future or into the past and back  with
this  spell.  It is recommended that the past be left alone for  the  general
safety of the future. The wizard controls the duration by his will. If beings
other  than the wizard are sent into the future or the past, they can  return
whenever they will it. The material component for this spell is a small piece

Upon  casting  this  spell,  the victim is effectively  ostracised  from  his
community: everyone knowing the victim will look upon him with disregard,  or
even disgust. Even good friends and close relatives will start neglecting and
avoiding  the  character,  eventually resulting in  total  isolation  of  the
victim.
This spell only affects reactions of those that knew the character before the
spell was cast: the victim can, for example, move to another town and start a
new  life  there.  People meeting him there will react normally,  unless  the
outcast's reputation has somehow reached them, in which case the may act with
prejudice.
This  spell  can be removed by a remove curse spell, provided it is  cast  by
someone  at  least  two levels higher than the caster of ostracise.  Also,  a
limited wish or wish will remove the effects.
To  cast  this  spell, the priest must point at the victim and order  him  to
leave  the  community, informing him that his presence  there  is  no  longer
appreciated. The victim must be able to understand the words of  the  priest.
The victim receives a saving throw versus spell, modified for Wisdom, with  a
1  penalty to the die roll for every three levels of experience he  has  less
than the priest. If the victim is of higher level, he receives a +1 bonus for
every one level of difference.

By  means  of this spell the wizard and a co-caster may vocally ask questions
of  the spirit of a dead creature and receive answers through the Ouija board
according to the knowledge of that creature. Unwilling spirits may attempt to
fight  the  power of the Ouija board and may save versus spell as they  would
have  saved  just before they died, and willing spirits will not be  able  to
find the Ouija board 10% of the time (-1% for every ten years dead).
The  Ouija  board is an oval slab of polished wood upon which are carved  the
numbers  and  letters of a writing system. In the first round this  spell  is
cast,  the  carvings on the board will change to represent  the  letters  and
numbers  of  the writing system of the creature being called.  Note  that  at
least  one of the wizards will need to be able to read that language in order
to  understand the spirits answers. Also on the board are the words "yes" and
"no"  for  answering simple questions quickly. These are always in  the  same
location, so a wizard asking a spirit yes-or-no questions need not be able to
converse in that spirit's language. While both wizards hold opposite ends  of
a  mithril  triangle  to the face of the board in which a  hollow  circle  is
inscribed, the spirit pushes the hollowed circle over the desired symbols.
If  two or more necromancers use the Ouija board together, the wizard's level
is  treated  as the sum of both. Otherwise, the co-caster is ignored,  though
this individual must still be a wizard.
Occasionally, the spirit may be yanked from the board by another, or may grow
disinterested in the conversation. The chance that a spirit will  "stay  with
it" for each minute of conversation is (10xlevel)% for the first minute minus
a cumulative 10% for each additional minute. Long dead creatures will be more
difficult to contact and keep "on-line" once contacted.
Having a part of the skeleton of the creature being contacted or being at the
place of death or main place of living or place of burial also helps somewhat
(+50% for contact and staying).
As  a  final note, it should be remembered that the Ouija board is a powerful
magical  item linking the prime-material plane to the various spirit  domains
including the plane of the dead. Powerful spirits have been known to use such
a board as an exit from their final places of rest.

This devotion is similar to contact other plane spell and requires
the   psionicist  had  access  to  psychoportive  and   telepathic
disciplines
      When this devotion is used, the psionicist sends her mind to
another  plane  of  existence  in  order  to  receive  advice  and
information  from  powers  there.  As  these  powers  resent  such
contact,  only  brief answers are given. Any questions  asked  are
answered  by  the  power  during  the  power's  maintenance.   The
character  can  contact an elemental plane or some  plane  farther
removed. For every 10 PSP spent one question may be asked. Contact
with  minds far removed from the plane of the psionicist increases
the  probability of the psionicist going insane or dying, but  the
chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability
of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by
moving  to distant planes. Once the outer planes are reached,  the
Intelligence of the power contacts determines the effects.
      The  random  table  given here is  subject  to  DM  changes,
development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on.
      If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question
is  asked.  This condition lasts for one week for each removal  of
the  plane  contacted to a maximum of ten weeks.  There  is  a  1%
chance  per  plane  that  the psionicist dies  before  recovering,
unless a psychic surgery is made upon her. A survivpsionicist  can
recall the answer to the question.
      On  rare  occasions, this divination may be blocked  by  the
action of certain lesser or greater powers.

results  in a nagging headache reducing Constitution and Charisma by one  for

The  psionicist converts PSPs into pure energy that resembles (but
is  not)  lightning.  The conversion is 1 PSP for  1d3  points  of
damage.  A psionicist may convert 1 PSP per level in a round.   So
a  level  15  psionicist may convert 15 PSPs  to  15d3  points  of
damage.   No  saving  throw is allowed,  and  powers  like  Energy
Containment have no effect in blocking this attack.  Also,  spells
such  as  Protection from Lightning and Resist Fire, are  useless.
If  a  telepathic defense mode is active, however, then damage  is
reduced by 10% since this energy is mental in origin.  Further, if
a  mind  is open to contact then the victim takes 10% more  damage
than  what  is specified in the die rolls.  A victim takes  normal
damage  either when they are a mind closed to contact not using  a
defense  mode,  or when they are a mind open to  contact  that  is
resisting  in  the manner described in the entry for  the  contact
power in CPH.
     This power is physically taxing, and may not be used for more
than 4 rounds before the psionicist has to rest for 2 rounds.  The
psionicist may opt to expend fewer PSPs than his/her maximum.  The
psionicist must announce both before making an initiative roll and
making a power check how many PSPs they intend to expend.

Power Score:  The conversion rate of PSP to damage improves to 1d6
points of damage per PSP spent.

20:   The  psionicist  takes 1d4 points of damage  for  every  PSP
he/she was going to expend that round.

This potent spell is an improved version of both unluck and bestow curse.  It
shifts the probability patterns into a dramatically negative pattern, causing
bad  results  even when they would be highly improbable. The  target  of  the
spell gets one saving throw to negate the spell entirely. If the saving throw
fails,  the  affected  creature acts at -4 for the  duration  of  the  spell.
Thapplies   to  everything:  attack  rolls,  damage  rolls,  saving   throws,
proficiency  checks, Armour Class, etc. The spell is cumulative  with  unluck
and bestow curse.
Furthermore, the target must save every round for the duration of  the  spell
or  a  fiasco  will occur. If this happens, the target suffers  horribly  bad
luck.  The  DM must judge what the absolute worst thing that could happen  to
the  character  that  round is, and apply it. If the target  fails  a  saving
throw,  he may suffer maximum damage possible. If he is in melee, his  weapon
may break. If he is casting a spell, it may backfire and affect him. Whatever
the  effect, it is drastically bad. At the very least, the target should slip
and fall prone in front of his enemies.
Every  time a fiasco occurs, there is a 10% cumulative chance that the  spell
breaks  (if  this happens, all fiasco and unluck spells affecting the  target
also break). In any case, when the spell ends, there is a 50% chance that the
target will be affected by the reverse effect of unluck in the next round, as
he "rebounds" from his stretch of bad luck.
The  potency of this spell carries a risk with it. When cast, if the caster's
Wild Magic Level Variation roll is below 4, a backfire occurs as follows:

     D20 Roll  Effect
     1    Caster affected by both Paithan's fiasco and unluck
     2    Only caster affected
     3    Caster and target affected
     4+   Spell functions as normal

The material component of this spell is a bit of fur from a black cat.

This extremely potent spell gives the target a run of good luck. This run  of
luck  is  accomplished  by applying the margin by  which  each  die  roll  is
succeeded as a modifier to the next. If the first die roll after the spell is
cast is failed, the spell dissipates without effect. However, if this roll is
successful,  then the margin of success is taken as a modifier for  the  next
roll. spell will expire at the end of the duration (that is, after 1d6 rounds
+ 1 round per level), or upon the first failure of a die roll.
Note  that  this  spell only applies to die rolls which have the  concept  of
success  versus failure. For example, the spell will apply to  to-hit  rolls,
but  will  not  apply to damage rolls. Other common die rolls to  which  this
spell  applies  include thieving skill rolls, saving throws, and  proficiency
checks.
Modifiers on d20 rolls are converted to and from percentile rolls at  a  rate
of  1 per 20 = 5%. For example, if a d20 roll is made by a margin of six, and
the  next  roll is on percentile dice, the modifier would be 30%. Conversely,
if  a  percentile  roll is made by 36%, and the next roll  is  an  1d20,  the
modifier would be 7 (percentile modifiers are rounded to the closest 5%).
Regardless of the modifiers being applied to the roll, a natural roll of 1 on
1d20  or  01-05 on percentile dice will fail and break the streak. Of course,
if low is good on a given roll, these failure numbers will be a natural 20 or
96-00.
When  a  hot  streak ends, there is a chance that there will be a probability
backlash.  There  is  a 5% chance per roll affected by hot  streak  that  the
subject  will  automatically fail on the next die roll after  hot  streak  is
over.
The reverse of this spell, Paithan's cold streak, causes the victim to have a
penalty  applied to each roll that is equal to the margin of failure  on  the
previous  roll. A successful roll will break the cold streak. The  victim  is
allowed  a  saving  throw  versus spell which, if made,  negates  the  spell.
However,  if the saving throw is failed, the margin of failure is immediately
used as the penalty on the next die roll. Like its reverse, a cold streak  is
broken if a critical roll is made (a 20 on 1d20 or 96-00 on percentile dice).
Similarly, when the streak is broken, the probability backlash may cause  the
next roll to automatically succeed.
A cold streak cannot be ended prematurely by dispel magic. A remove curse has
a  base  55%  chance to remove the spell, modified by plus or  minus  5%  per
difference in the levels of the casters (cf. dispel magic).

When  cast,  Paldeggeron's accurate arrow enchants one missile weapon  (i.e.,
sling  stone, arrow, quarrel, etc.) to automatically hit any target  normally
within  the weapon's range. Effective with "called shots", and situations  of
that  nature.  The missile's enchantment does normal damage  as  it  were  an
unaided hit of the same nature. The enchantment instantly wears off upon  the

When  Pander's improved identify is cast, magical items subsequently  touched
by  the  wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceding  the
casting  of  the  spell  must  be  spent purifying  the  items  and  removing
influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is
interrupted, it must be begun again with a new casting of the spell  and  the
current  spell  is  lost  since this higher level  version  requires  intense
concentration. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in  turn  by
the  wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and
may  end  the  spell,  although the wizard is allowed any  applicable  saving
throw. However, immediately before handling each item the wizard may scan the
items  for any cursed properties from a distance of 10 feet without  touching
the  item. The wizard has a 5% chance per level of determining if there is  a
curse and also the exact nature of the curse, to a maximum of 90%, rolled  by
the DM. Each try is treated as one reading and the wizard need not use a slot
to  determine the exact nature of a curse unless he wishes. This part of  the
divination  can  only detect curses, not traps. It should be noted  that  the
wizard  may  not add to the list of original items that were to  be  examined
once  this  condition  is established. If the act of detecting  for  a  curse
actually  triggers  one that affects the wizard he may make  a  saving  throw
versus spell to avoid the curse in question.
The  chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to  10%
per  level of the wizard, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll  of
96 up to 00 indicates a false reading (91 up to 95 reveals nothing). Only one
function  of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e.,  a  5th-
level  wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different  items,
five different functions or a single item, or any combination of the two). If
any  attempt  at reading fails, the wizard cannot learn any more  about  that
item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical
tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.
Exact attack or damage bonuses, charges of an item may be determined; one per
reading. A longsword, +1/+4 versus undead has two individual functions.
After  casting  the spell and determining what can be learned  from  it,  the
wizard  loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to  recover
each  point  of  Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the wizard  below  a
Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained  until
full  Constitution  is restored, which takes 24 hours (one  point  per  three
hours for unconscious character).

The  material  components of this spell are a crushed pearl and jet  gemstone
(of at least 100 gp value each), and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the
infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to
the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent and the functions of  a
multi-function item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option,
certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.

This  spell  encapsulates the wizard, and possibly more people  or  equipment
inside a conjured whirlwind. One of two variations of this spell may be  cast
without prior preparation at the option of the wizard.
The  first  variation  is used by the wizard for personal  transportation  or
protection. While encapsulated in the whirlwind's eye the wizard can view the
outside  normally  and  cause  the whirlwind  to  travel  over  any  relative
continuous surface with short hops over ditches or small obstacles not over 4
feet  in height being possible. The wizard may not carry more than his normal
encumbrance  and  all equipment must be on his person (exceeding  this  limit
causes  the whirlwind to fizzle). No other creature may occupy the  whirlwind
unless it is carried. On solid ground the whirlwind can move up to 24 + 1 per
level  above fifth level. Rate of movement is the same whether moving uphill,
downhill,  or on stairs. Over loose sand or marsh the movement rate  is    of
normal  and over water the movement rate is half normal. Wind velocities  can
affect  the rate of speed. Although the wizard may cast any spell from within
the  eye, none will breach the barrier of the winds and spells such as  magic
missile,  fireball,  or lightning bolt will bounce back towards  the  wizard,
possibly ruining an otherwise fine day.
This  variation's duration is 1 turn per level and can be turned on  and  off
any  time during the duration. It takes half a round to turn the winds on  or
off  (a  good wizard would calculate a spell so that it goes off  the  moment
after the whirlwind stops). The wizard is still susceptible to outside damage
from spells, but only takes half or no damage if saving throws are made while
inside  the  whirlwind. Projectiles of a small nature will not penetrate  the
winds  and the wizard's Armour Class and saving throws versus dodging have  a
+4 bonus while inside the eye of the whirlwind.
The  second variation is not as fast and cannot be turned on and off  (it  is
only  good  for  a one-way trip). However, its area of effect  is  a  20-foot
diameter  column  which is 10 feet high (centred on the wizard)  and  it  can
carry  along  anything in the area of effect on a relatively safe  ride  over
long  distances. Movement conforms as above but the base rate is 12 +  1  per
level  of  the wizard over fifth level and the duration is 1 hour per  level.
All  spells  cast from inside conform as above, as do effects of area  spells
cast  at  the whirlwind. All inside have a +4 Armour Class bonus  since  they
cannot  be  seen, but there are no dodging bonuses and saving  throws  versus
dodging are based on the wizard for the entire group. Weight is not a  factor
when determining what is picked up for the ride. Anything not securely rooted
to  the  ground will be picked up. Once started, the winds may only be exited
or  penetrated after startup by making a successful saving throw versus spell
at  a  penalty of 1 for every two levels of the wizard, rounded down.  Flying
creatures  who  enter or exit from the top have no penalty  on  their  saving
throw.  Creatures  larger  than  the area of  effect  will  simply  push  the
whirlwind away if they try to enter it. The wizard may stop the winds at  any
time.

The  material component of this spell is a piper's flute which is  played  to
bring the whirlwind from the elemental plane of air.

  Using  this power, the psionicist can paralyze a creature contac
The  creature must be within 90 yards of the psionicist, but needs
not  be within line-of-sight.  If the creature is able to be seen,
there is no modification to the psionicist's power score.  If  the
creature  is not visible (invisible, hidden, or otherwise  blocked
from sight), the psionicist's power score is reduced by three.
      Any creature affected by this power must make a saving throw
vs.  paralyzation  or  be  unable to move.   The  power  works  by
blocking  signals  from  the creature's  brain  to  its  voluntary
muscles.  Since the brain cannot issue any new instructions to the
voluntary muscles, they remain in the position that they were last
told  to  assume.   (Okay, so this isn't exactly how  the  nervous
system really works, but this is a fantasy game . . .)  This power
can  in  no way affect involuntary muscles, so the victim  doesn't
have to worry about breathing or having a heart attack.
       The  victim  is  affected only as long  as  the  psionicist
maintains  the  power, and can move normally after  the  power  is
ended  (assuming  they've survived).  As with any  other  form  of
paralysis,  any  paralyzed creature can be  automatically  hit  in
combat   situations,   or  automatically  killed   in   non-combat
situations.  Note that good psionicists who use this power to make
foes  into easy targets will find their alignments bending towards
evil.   (That  is,  if they intentionally do  so.   If  the  party
berserker  picks off a helpless opponent that the  psionicist  was
planning to interrogate, then it's the fighter's problem, not  the
psionicist's.)

Power  Score:   The  paralysis  lasts  for  1d6+1  turns  with  no
maintenance cost and contact need not be continued.

20:   The psionicist must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation  or
be paralyzed for 1d6 + 1 rounds.

Paranoia is a spell used to unnerve and frighten humanoid creatures.  If  the
target  makes  a  saving throw versus spell with a -3 penalty  (adjusted  for
Wisdom), then he will greatly desire to leave his present location, but  will
suffer no other ill effects. Elves have a 5% chance to resist the effects  of
the spell, but still get a saving throw.
Creatures  who fail the saving throw are convinced that "everyone is  out  to
get  them".  The spell creates a hallucinatory person who follows the  target
everywhere,  but disappears when looked for. The target also has the  feeling
that  he is being watched, and in fact has a chance (5% per wizard level)  of
thinking  someone nearby is spying on him. The target believes that  everyone
is  talking  about him, especially those whose conversations he  can't  hear.
Remove  Curse or Heal will restore the person's mind, but Dispel  Magic  will
not.  Furthermore,  any  action  that requires  concentration  (spellcasting,
turning undead, using a psionic ability or thief skill, etc.) has a chance to
fail  due  to the victim's highly emotional state. The chance of  failure  is
(levelx5)% - 30%.
The  final  result of this spell is that anyone who fails their saving  throw
will be branded insane or bewitched, and treated appropriately. NPCs who  are
subjected  to  this  spell will spend at least the next  day  sulking,  still
afraid of everyone (this is not a magical effect, simply an after-effect). If
an  NPC  knows who cast the spell, they will either be afraid of  the  wizard
(for weaker NPCs) or very angry (stronger NPCs).
For example: two wizards cast paranoia at Strongarm and Bloodaxe, who are  in
a  large  dining room. Bloodaxe makes his saving throw, and becomes aware  of
something  being  wrong in the room. He leaves, wary of  what  might  be  out
there,  but  more  afraid of what is inside. Bloodaxe suffers  no  other  ill
effects.  Strongarm  fails  his  saving throw,  and  becomes  convinced  that
everyone  in the room is either plotting against him, or spying  on  him.  In
fact,  he's  certain  that the duke is spying on him. Not  willing  to  fight
everyone in the room ("they're all out to get me!"), Strongarm flees.  As  he
runs  down  an  empty hallway, he gets the feeling he's being  followed,  and
actually  sees  someone  in the corner of his eye. When  Strongarm  tries  to
confronhis  shadow, he finds nothing. Once the spell expires, he  will  still
feel  uneasy  (memories  of  having  everyone  against  you  are  not  easily
forgotten), but will no longer act abnormally.
This  spell  was  developed  by  Vanquil as a response  to  another  wizard's
powerful  mental spell, which caused great pain in its victims (specifically,
Corinna and her psiblade. Corinna has yet to experience a paranoia spell...).
This  spell  does not carry Vanquil's name since he does not wish  it  to  be
traced back to him (for good reason).

The  material component is either a lock of hair from a madman or a  drop  of
blood from an assassinated noble or official.

The  first  effect of this spell is to allow the priest to walk on water,  as
per the 3rd-level spell water walk. The spell's major effect, however, is  to
allow  the  priest to transport himself via any moving body of water  with  a
velocity  of up to   mile per level; the priest walks on the water,  takes  a
step  upstream  or  downstream,  and  is instantly  transported  the  desired
distance; those along the way can see a fleeting image of the priest if  they
happen to be looking at the body of water at the time.
The  priest may only transport himself once during the spell duration, though
he may walk on the water surface until it ends. If the current starts or ends
before  the specified distance, the priest's travel ends there. The  material
component  for  this spell is a miniature bucket, which is  consumed  in  the
casting.

To  cast the spell, the wizard places a piece of unspun cotton and a piece of
grey glass (the material components) within his hands and casts the spell.
The  spell  is centred upon the wizard's hand, which contains the components.
The sphere is a hazy grey which cuts out most, but not all, of the light. The
sphere  also cuts out most, but not all, of the sound. It creates the  effect
of being in a darkened room with the doors and windows closed. Once cast, the
sphere does not move.
Notes: great for sleeping in after a late party.

This power causes the object affected to continue on it's path and
speed  for  the duration of the power.  This could give  an  arrow
unlimited  range,  cause arching missiles (such  as  catapults  or
slings)  to  miss  or  people or creatures  that  are  running  to
continue running in their current direction.  This could be useful
to  cause  a  person to run off a cliff, or into  something.   The
psionicist  must activate this power before the object  is  moved.
Creatures  affected  mist make a strength  check  to  avoid  being
affected.

Power Score:  The speed is doubled as well as being perpetual.

This  spell  leads  a person to believe that he is being  persecuted  by  his
friends and allies. He will feel that they are torturing him, and holding him
against  his will. If he has been affected by the spell for over 12 days,  he
will  become violent and enraged, and attempt to kill his friends, and others
whom  he believes to be persecuting him. Any attempt by his friends to reason
with him, will incite this rage prematurely. Should he succeed in killing all
those  that  he  believes are persecuting him, the spell will instantly  end,
with  him  having full realization of what he has done. Roll on the following

      By  means  of  this spell, a wizard is able to endow  a  single  target
creature with a magical field which causes all creatures within the  area  of
effect  (of  the same basic species) to be drawn toward the target  creature,
much  in  the say way that metal is attracted to a lodestone. The spell  will
affect  target creatures of up to 4+2 Hit Dice. A saving throw  versus  spell
will  totally  negate  this spell, but the Hit Dice of  the  target  creature
modify its saving throw in the following manner:

Hit Dice       Saving Throw Modifier
------------------------------------
less than 1    -4
less than 2    -3
less than 3    -2
less than 4    -1
4+              0

     Creatures that have magical auras are totally immune to this spell. This
includes dragons, cockatrice, etc.

      If  the spell dweomer successfully affects the target creature it  will
then  attempt  to  attract all surrounding creatures  of  the  same  species,
causing  them  to move at their normal movement rate (and locomotion)  toward
the  target  creature.  The  area of effect is a  sphere  around  the  target
creature which extends outward up to 1 yard per level of the wizard, up to  a
maximum  of  a  10-yard radius. The number of creatures within  the  area  of
effect  which  the  dweomer will attempt to attract is  equal  to  twice  the
current  level of the wizard. The wizard is unable to change this  number  in
any way and may himself be affected by the dweomer (if of the same species as
the  target  creature) if caught within the area of effect. For  purposes  of
this  spell, hybrids are considered an individual species, so half-orcs would
only attract other half-orcs, not other orcs or humans.

      The  area  of effect is stronger near the target creature and therefore
has  more of a chance to attract a being toward the target than at the  outer
limits  of  the  sphere. The outer 1 yard of the area of effect  will  always
allow  creatures  a normal saving throw versus spell against the  attraction.
But,  for  every  yard closer, the creature is penalised by a  cumulative  -1
modifier  to  its saving throw. Here are examples of a 1st-level,  5th-level,
and 10th-level (or higher) wizard casting this spell:

1st-level wizard:
distance in yards        0     1
saving throw modifier    -     0

5th-level wizard:
distance in yards        0     1     2     3     4     5
saving throw modifier    -    -4    -3    -2    -1     0

10th-level wizard or higher:
distance in yards        0     1     2     3     4     5      6      7      8
9    10
saving  throw modifier    -    -9    -8    -7    -6    -5    -4     -3     -2
-1     0

     A successful saving throw against the attraction means that the spell is
unable to attract this creature toward the target creature.

      Note that the wizard may reduce the size of the area of effect to  less
than  he  is  able  to affect (in one-yard decrements) but the  saving  throw
modifiers are a product of the size of the area of effect, not the  level  of
the  wizard casting the spell. This means that if a 10th-level wizard reduces
the  area  of  effect to a one-yard sphere it would only be  able  to  affect
creatures  within one yard of the target creature and they  would  receive  a
normal  saving throw, but he will still able to try to attract  20  creatures
toward  the target whereas the 1st-level wizard would only be able to attract
2.  Also,  remember  that  the area of effect is three-dimensional,  and  can
affect  creatures  through any material that does not  shield  against  magic
(lead,  for example). Creatures that are physically unable to become  "stuck"
to  the target will stick to whatever physical object is blocking their path,
such as walls, floors, doors, etc.

      If any creatures become "stuck" to the target creature, it and whatever
is  stuck to it become entangled with each other, effectively reducing  their
normal  movement  rate  to 0. Creatures being drawn  toward  the  target  are
totally  unable to attack, but may attack from the mass with one attack  form
per  round if the attack does not require melee combat (breath weapon,  gaze,
etc.).  If  the combat form requires physical contact, a "stuck" creature  is
only  entitled to attack once per round and only if it is first  attacked  by
someone  striking at it while it is entangled. Attacks on entangled creatures
are  at  +4 to-hit, and the creatures are penalised -3 on the return  attack.
Also, creatures so entangled lose all Armour Class bonuses for Dexterity  and
cannot cast any spells requiring somatic components.

The  material  component of this spell is a lodestone of at  least  2  gp  in
weight.  It  will  disintegrate  if the target  creature  successfully  saves
against the spell. Otherwise, it is reusable, and only need be touched during
the casting to act as a focus for the wizard.

This  spell is used to alert an extra-planar being that the wizard wishes  to
contact it. The spell does not allow further communication (though the extra-

happen: 1) the spell recipient (victim) believes that he has been polymorphed
into  another  form  and 2) an illusion of the form apparently  "polymorphed"
into  is  provided  to enhance the delusion. If the spell recipient  makes  a
saving throw versus death magic, the entire spell is foiled. If there are any
observers  to  this spell, a saving throw on their part does not  negate  the
spell:  they  will  see  the victim behaving as if he  has  been  polymorphed
(observers  might  think  the victim to be insane). Observers  who  save  may
communicate  this fact to others (including the victim), thereby gaining  one
additional saving throw at +4.
The  phantasamorph lasts as long as the caster is concentrating on the  spell
and  is  within  spell  range. Violating either condition  will  shorten  the
duration  to  an  additional  round per level of  the  caster.  The  material
component  of this spell is a small amount of doppleganger flesh or  a  small
golden trinket suspended on a chain.

Upon the casting of this spell, an illusion is generated which may attack all
believing  creatures within a five foot per level radius  of  the  illusion's
epicentre which itself must be within 50 feet of the wizard. Creatures within
the radius must make an Intelligence check (at a modifier ranging from -5  to
+5,  depending  on  the  plausibility of the  illusion)  or  believe  in  the
illusion's reality. Creatures which make their Intelligence checks  may  save
versus  spell  or suffer the illusions effects despite their  disbelief.  The
illusion  may  cause  up  to 1d6 damage per creature  for  every  round  such
creatures are in the radius. The wizard must maintain concentration  for  the
duration  or the magic will dissipate. The material component for this  spell
is a bit of fleece.

By  use  of  this spell, the wizard creates an illusion which may attack  all
believing  creatures within a radius of five feet per level of the illusion's
centre  which itself must be within 100 feet of the wizard. Creatures  within
this  radius must make both a modified Intelligence check and a saving  throw
versus spell in order to avoid the illusion's effects.
The  illusion  may cause up to 1d8 damage per creature for every  round  such
creatures   are   within  the  radius.  The  wizard  must  maintain   minimal
concentration  on  the  illusion, being unable to cast  spells  but  able  to
otherwise  act  normally  (or abnormally for that matter).  Furthermore,  the
wizard  may move the epicentre of the illusion at will. Finally, the illusion
may  persist in a reiterative form for 1d4 rounds after the wizard breaks off
concentration either by leaving the range of the epicentre or casting spells.
The material component for this spell is a bit of fleece.

When this spell is cast on a single individual of not greater than twice  the
Hit  Dice or level of the wizard, the diabolic magic of the spell sweeps into
the  darkest  corner  of  the victim's mind constructing  from  the  idea  an
illusory form of the subject's greatest fear. This fear "strikes" with  a  15
THAC0,  is  invulnerable  to all attacks, and will  kill  the  subject  on  a
successful hit. Generally speaking, the only defense save for distracting the
wizard  is  an  attempt to disbelieve (make Intelligence check on  3d6).  The
material component for this spell is a bit of fleece.

This   powerful  defensive  spell  provides  superlative  protection  against
directed energy attacks. Any spell or effect which projects a discrete stream
of  energy at the recipient is deflected back in the direction from which  it
came. This is more than just a simple deflection, however. The spell is phase
conjugated,  which means it retraces its path exactly. If  the  recipient  is
within  half  the range of the attacking spell, the offending wizard  suffers
the full effect of his own spell, no saving throw allowed. The reason this is
so,  is  that  the  wizard cannot possibly dodge fast  enough  to  avoid  the
rebounding  energies. Only magic resistance, and whatever other  defenses  he
may have, will protect him.
Examples of spells affected by phase conjugation are:
          any ray-type spell,
          magic missiles of any type,
          lightning bolts (call lighting will not strike the wizard), and
          cone of cold, heat, or force (only the recipient is protected).
Examples of spells not affected are:
          fireball, or any similar magic (they change form on impact),
          breath weapons,
          power words,
          touch spells, and
          cone of acid or steam (they project matter, not energy).

The  material component of this spell is a small device consisting  of  three
highly polished triangular mithril mirrors set at right angles to each other,
forming a corner of a cube. This device costs at least 1000 gp.

A  psionicist with phase self can shift his body and any equipment
his  is  carrying, millionth of a degree off of the  plane  he  is
currently  on.  While using this power he can not affect  anything
and  can  not be affected by anything on that plane,  but  he  can
still  hear  and see everything around him.  This  allows  him  to
stand  in or walk through walls, objects, and even people  without
affecting them.  The psionicist can even stand in flame and no  be
burned.  He is truly invisible, and can not be seen, smelt,  felt,
or heard. With one exception, true seeing can see him.

Power  Score:   The  psionicist can not be  seen  even  with  true
seeing.

20:  The psionicist becomes phased permanently for 1D4 hours.

This  spell can give a ship up to the maximum effect of the spell caster  the
ability  to  phase  out of view like a phase spider (it stays  until  it  has
attacked and then phases out). This ability can be used at the command of the
captain, who has to be within range of the spell as it is cast and he has  to
stay  on board of his ship throughout the duration; otherwise it is cancelled
instantly.  If  the captain is slain, knocked unconscious,  feebleminded,  or
disabled in his free will in any way, the spell is cancelled, too. The  whole
ship  including crew, cargo, and atmosphere phases out at the command of  the
captain.   This  phasing  out  ability  causes  the  ship  to  be  completely
invulnerable  for any ships that cannot also phase out. This phasing  ability
only  works within crystal shells. Anyone who has initiative before the  ship
with  the  phasing ability has the possibility of attacking before it  phases
out.  The other possibility to attack is to phase out also, but in that  case
the  only  damage possible would be with either magical weapons (which  cause
only their magical bonus of damage if they hit) or by ramming. As phasing out
means entering the ethereal plane, all missiles and other combat changes  are
affected  by  the  laws  of  the ethereal plane. The  phasing  ability  works
automatically while the ships is at interstellar speed. But the phasing  does
not  prevent the slowing down of ships as they meet in wild space.  Thus,  it
could  be  as  helpful  as dangerous (it could help to  phase  through  those
dangerous explosive flaming lifeboats left over by some ships, but  it  could
be  very  dangerous if one phases in right in the centre  of  a  sun  in  the
company of a sun dragon...). Normally, the captain and the crew can look from
the  border  of  ethereal  to the prime, but there may  be  some  significant
factors which prevent that.

The  material components are one completely preserved dead body  of  a  phase
spider  per  3  tons of ship to phase out. In addition, one dose  of  oil  of
ethereality has to be applied to each crew member during the casting for  the
phasing  ability to work. Once the spell is cast, any additional or new  crew
members  don't need this oil applied until the spell runs out or a new  spell
of the same kind is cast.

This  spell,  a variation of the 1st-level copy spell, allows the  wizard  to
create  a  permanent image, on a piece of parchment, canvas, or the like,  of
whatever  he sees and concentrates upon at the time of casting, to the  range
of  his  vision.  Detail in the final picture depends on distance,  field  of
vision, and level of the wizard. For every level of the wizard, he may choose
that  the  final image will appear on the parchment as if he  were  10  yards
closer  to  the  subject;  eg., the picture created  by  a  5th-level  wizard
standing 60 yards away from a creature could contain detail he would normally
notice at a distance of 10 yards.
Material components are a piece of parchment, paper or canvas - which is  not
expended and upon which the image appears - and a silver coin and a pinch  of
salt (which are expended).

      When this cantrip is cast, the wizard imbues the chosen pillow with  an
enchanted mouth. The mouthed pillow will only speak about sexual topics.  The
wizard  at casting time has the option to decide the level of vulgarity.  The
level  varies  from  perverse  smut  to intellectual  discussions  on  sexual

This spell is similar to fireball, except that it causes a burst of acid in a
20-foot radius globe. Pilpin created this spell for security reasons  in  his
regular dealings with lower plane creatures.
Creatures within the area of effect will take 1d8 points of damage per  level
of  the wizard unless they make a successful saving throw, in which case they
will  take half damage. Any paper, parchment, or soft metals within the  area
of  effect are destroyed, other items are allowed a saving throw. Possessions
of  a  creature  that successfully saves are unaffected by the Acidball.  The
wizard must have a clear line of sight to the target area.

The material components are a drop of water and a scale from a black dragon.

This  spell causes a single person (as defined in charm person) to act as  if
he  had  a  different alignment than his own. The specific alignment  is  the
wizard's  choice, but must be chosen when the spell is memorised. An affected
creature  will wholeheartedly embrace the new alignment, seeing the error  or
foolishness  of  his past ways. Alignment detecting spells  (detect  evil  or
good, true seeing, etc.) will detect the creatures true alignment, but spells
such as true seeing will also reveal that the creature is charmed.
The  base  saving throw is made at -3 if the change is only by  one  division
(eg. lawful good to lawful neutral or neutral good). The saving throw is at -
2  if the attempted alignment change is by two divisions (eg., lawful good to
lawful  evil, chaotic good, or neutral). If the attempted change is by  three
positions  (eg., lawful good to neutral evil or chaotic neutral)  the  saving
throw  is  at  -1. For diametrically opposed alignments the saving  throw  is
normal (eg., lawful good to chaotic evil). Furthermore, creatures and classes
restricted to a specific alignment (paladins, druids, demons, etc.) get a  +3
bonus  to  their  saving throw. Creatures or classes restricted  to  specific
morals  or  ethics (rangers, assassins, barbarians, etc.) get a +2  bonus  to
their saving throw if the alignment change conflicts with the restriction.
Pilpin's  alignment charm is not affected by dispel magic, remove  curse,  or
heal,  but a restoration or (limited) wish spell will negate it. The material
component  of  the spell is a small piece of wool soaked in the  blood  of  a
creature with the desired alignment.

This  spell  summons into existence up to 50 instruments that will  play  any
piece  of  music  for which sheet music is present. The specific  instruments
summoned are decided by the wizard, so the non-weapon proficiency of artistic
ability,  or  musical instrument is required by the wizard, or a  consultant.
The  sheet music is placed on a music stand before the band, and as the music
is  played  the pages are flipped automatically. When the piece of  music  is
over,  placing new music or flipping the present one to the first  page  will
start  the band playing again. The sound volume of the band is controlled  by
the wizard.

The  material  components are a single, golden, miniature replica  for  every
type  of  instrument  summoned, a full sized  silver  music  stand,  and  the
appropriate  sheet music. Everything but the sheet music is consumed  in  the

This  spell conjures 250 flea-infested rats that carry the bacteria  yersinia
pestis, commonly known as the black death or bubonic plague. These rats  will
act  as  any  other rat and simply scurry away. If this spell is  cast  in  a
humanoid  community, it will cause a number of humanoids to  become  infected
with  the disease and probably die. The number of people infected depends  on
the  size  of the community, the season, and a little bit of chance.  In  the
following  table,  the column entitled "Number Infected" gives  a  number  of
creatures  infected  in the community or a percentage of creatures  infected.
Use the value that gives the smallest number.
For example, if the spell was cast in a village of 200 elves in the middle of
summer, the choice from the table is 300 elves or 60 elves (30% of 200),  the
number  infected  is  then 60 (because it's the smaller  number  and  300  is
impossible). It will take 2d6 days for the creatures to become infected.

     Season    Number Infected     Plague
     Winter    50 or 5%  0%
     Spring or Fall 200 or 20%     1%
     Summer    300 or 30%     3%

The  final  column,  "Plague", gives the chance  that  the  disease  actually
reaches  epidemic  proportions. If this happens, 1 in  3  humanoid  creatures
(33%) in a 100-mile radius will be infected by the disease. The wizard can be
infected by his own disease.
A  diseased creature will lose 2 points of Constitution, 1 point of  Strength
and  1 point of Dexterity per day of infection until death, which occurs when
Constitution  has  reached  -10. The rats and disease  are  not  magical  and
therefore  cannot  be dispelled. A creature does not get a  saving  throw  to
resist being infected, it's strictly by chance. The disease can be cured by a
character with healing proficiency that makes a successful proficiency check,
or by magical means. A cured creature will regain 1 point of each ability per
day.

The  material components are a tiny rat skin bag containing rotting  humanoid
flesh, which both disappear upon casting.

The  spell  conjures a 1 foot thick wall of black mist that causes  death  to
most  creatures that touch it. The wall cannot be seen through, but sound  or
objects will pass through it. Any living creature that touches or attempts to
pass  through  the  wall  must  roll a saving throw  versus  death,  modified
depending on their level as follows:

     Creature's Hit Dice Saving Throw
     up to 1   None
     1 or 2    -4
     3 or 4    -3
     5 or 6    -2
     7 or 8    -1
     8+   Negates

The wall can be shaped into a rectangle, box, hemisphere, sphere, or just one
huge wall, as long as the surface area is 50,000 square feet. The wall cannot
be physically disturbed (i.e., blown away, pushed, etc.), but parts of it can
be  negated by a successful dispel magic. It can be penetrated using an anti-
magic  shell, or totally negated with a wish. The material components  are  a
crushed black pearl and a vial of gaseous death poison.

This spell is a more powerful version of the alarm spell. The wizard causes a
one-story building, with a base dimension of 400 feet by 400 feet,  to  react
to  the presence of any creature larger than one-half cubic foot in volume or
about three pounds in weight. The wizard can Alarm a multi-story building  by
reducing  the  base area proportionally. As soon as any creature  enters  the
warded  area,  touches  it,  or otherwise contacts  it,  without  speaking  a
password  established  by the wizard, the enhanced  alarm  lets  out  a  loud
ringing that can be clearly heard throughout the area of effect and 100 yards
beyond. The sound lasts for one round then ceases. Furthermore, if the wizard
is  within the area of effect he will automatically know where the alarm  was
triggered. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger the alarm,
but flying, levitating, invisible, incorporeal or gaseous creatures do.

The  material components are a tiny silver bell, a very fine silver  wire,  a
piece of the building to be warded, and a pinch of powdered pineal gland.

#9#
This dangerous spell turns a specially prepared wand into a magical wand  for
one day. The wand can be used by anyone who knows the command word, which  is
decided upon by the wizard.
The  power  the  wand contains depends on what spell the  wizard  decided  to
enchant the wand with. The wand can be made to cast any single spell,  chosen
by  the wizard, of up to fifth level that has a casting time of up to 1 round
(find  familiar,  strength,  phantom steed,  hallucinatory  terrain,  conjure
elemental, etc. could not be used).
The  number  of charges the wand containdepends on the number  of  times  the
wizard  casts the chosen spell into the ephemeral wand (obviously  it  cannot
have  more than five charges). The wizard must have previously memorised  the
appropriate  spells.  For example, a 16th-level wizard creates  an  ephemeral
wand that casts the 5th-level spell wall of iron. If the wizard wanted to put
five charges in the wand he would have to use all five of his 5th-level spell
slots to memorise five walls of iron. He would then use all five of his  wall
of  iron spells to give the wand five charges. The wand cannot have different
spells  in  it, a different wizard cannot add charges to it, nor  can  it  be
recharged.  The  spell in the wand takes as long to activate as  the  casting
time  of  the  spell, and the spell performs at the experience level  of  its
creator.  There  is  a  5%  chance per usage that the  spell  cast  from  the
ephemeral wand backfires, the exact details depending on the spell being cast
(DM's love this kind of thing!).
The  casting time for this spell is 1 turn plus 1 round per charge added. The
material  component  is  an ivory wand, inlaid with a  special  gold  pattern
(minimum  1000 gp in craftsmanship) and topped with a diamond worth at  least
1000  gp.  The  wand does not disappear at the end of the spell (although  it
could very well get stolen): it simply becomes non-magical.

This spell allows the wizard plus one other creature for every two levels  of
the  wizard  to  enter  the border ethereal, slowly disappearing  from  view,
taking  a  round  to  fade  away.  Creatures in  the  border  ethereal  exist
simultaneously  in both the prime material and the ethereal plane.  From  the
border  ethereal the creature can enter the deep ethereal and travel  to  the
inner  planes (refer to the Manual of the Planes). Alternate prime  materials
cannot  be  reached through the ethereal plane because each  alternate  prime
material  has  an alternate ethereal (travelling to alternate prime  material
planes can only be done through the inner planes or from the prime material).
To enter the bordered plane the creature simply wills it so, and materialises
in the adjoining plane in a few seconds.
Creatures  in  the  border ethereal are invisible to those on  the  bordering
plane,  although  they can be detected from that plane  by  means  of  detect
invisibility  and  true seeing. Such a creature revealed would  appear  as  a
smoky,  translucent shade. Creatures in the border ethereal  cannot  verbally
communicate with the inhabitants of the plane they border, nor can  they  use
equipment,  items,  or spells to attack creatures in the plane  they  border.
Likewise, inhabitants of the other plane cannot attack beings that are in the
border  ethereal (with a few exceptions, like the gaze attacks  of  basilisks
and  catoblepases). Phase door and dispel magic will bring creatures  out  of
the border ethereal.
Travellers  in  the  border  ethereal can move through  the  plane  they  are
bordering without problem, moving vertically or horizontally without need for
support.  They  travel  at  the  speed they  would  on  the  bordered  plane.
Travellers in the border ethereal can move through solid matter in the  plane
bordered, except dense metals (gold, lead, etc.), living beings (above single
celled),  and  certain spells that detect and ban the ethereal.  Examples  of
spells that affect ethereal creatures are glyph of warding and Mordenkainen's
faithful hound, which both detect and attack ethereal creatures.
Travellers in the border ethereal can see into the adjoining plane,  but  all
colours  are  reduced to shades of grey and sight is limited  to  120  yards.
Infravision and ultravision work from the border ethereal. Divination  spells
can  be  cast against targets in the adjoining plane, but no other  types  of
magic  can  affect  creatures in the bordered plane.  Spells  in  the  border
ethereal  work under the restrictions of the ethereal plane (again, refer  to
the Manual of the Planes).

The material components are 200 gp worth of powdered silver and crushed phase
spider hide, which disappear during casting.

The  fire carpet brings forth an immobile, blazing carpet of magical fire  of
shimmering colour - violet or reddish-blue. The spell covers an area  of  the
ground equal to one 20 foot square per level of the wizard and the flames are
4 feet high.
The  carpet  sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 1d4 points of damage  upon
creatures  within  10  feet. In addition, the carpet inflict  2d6  points  of
damage,  plus  1 point of damage per level of the wizard, upon  any  creature
within  the area of effect. For creatures moving through the area,  the  fire
inflicts  2d6 points of damage per 20 feet of the area of effect  crossed.  A
successful  saving  throw  versus spell (modified by  Dexterity  bonus)  will
reduce  damage to half, or none if the creature was close to the edge of  the
area of effect.
For example, a 10th-level wizard centres the spell on a fighter. The area  of
effect  is  50x40 feet. The fighter fails his saving throw and  takes  2d6+10
points  of  damage. The warrior then runs out of the area toward the  closest
edge which is 20 feet away. If the warrior was surprised he must again roll a
saving throw. He again fails his saving throw and takes another 2d6+10 points
of damage.
Creatures  more than 8 feet tall take only half damage. Creatures  especially
subject  to  fire may take additional damage, to the DM's option, and  undead
always take twice normal damage. The wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard
concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per level of experience  of  the
wizard, in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it.

The material component of the spell is phosphorus.

This  spell causes a person (as defined in charm person) to be overcome  with
tremendous  greed. If the person fails a saving throw versus spell,  he  will
want  the first thing of value that he sees, and if refused, will become very
angry. They will not act against their alignment or foolishly risk their life
to  get  what they want, but will not give up until they own the item or  one
just like it. The person will sell or trade anything they possess to get  the
item.  Once in possession of the item or a replica, the affected person  will
want  the next item of value that they see, and this will continue until  the
spell duration expires.
For  example:  Mel,  a  lawful good ranger affected  by  the  spell,  becomes
infatuated  with a beautiful carriage he sees in the street. Mel attempts  to
buy  the  carriage from its owner, but the owner refuses to sell the carriage
on the grounds that it's from a far away kingdom. Mel denounces him as greedy
and  inconsiderate. Mel then starts to journey to the distant kingdom to  get
one  for  himself. Eleven days later the spell wears off (if cast by a  10th-
level wizard) and he finds himself 11 days away from home attempting to buy a
carriage he has no use for.
Shandar,  a chaotic evil fighter affected by the spell, spies a golden  crown
she just has to have. Unfortunately it belongs to her boss, a High Priest  of
Hisisi.  Realizing that she can't just take it, she spends all the money  she
has  to hire an assassin for the job. The mission is successful and she  gets
the  crown.  When  the assassin hands her the crown, Shandar's  attention  is
suddenly  focused  on  the  exquisite ring the  assassin  possesses.  Quickly
deciding  that  the  assassin  is  no match  for  her  in  open  combat,  she
immediately attacks the assassin. Not very smart: the assassin kills her.
The  spell can be negated by a heal, wish, or a successful dispel magic.  The
material components are a gold piece and a small piece of lodestone.

This  spell can be rather harmless, or fatal. A person (as defined  in  charm
person)  that  does not save versus spell is struck with  a  random  type  of
insanity.  Roll a 1d20 on the following table to determine type (consult  the
Dungeon Master's Guide, page 83, for explanations):

     D20 Roll  Insanity  D20 Roll  Insanity
     1    dipsomania     11   dementia insanity praecox
     2    kleptomania    12   lunacy

     9    delusional     19   suicidal mania
     10   mania     20   schizophrenia

A  person  affected  by this spell will not notice anything  different  about
himself, and - depending on the type of insanity - those around him  may  not
notice  any  difference. The insanity is permanent until negated by  a  heal,
restoration, limited wish, wish, or a successful dispel magic.

The  material  component of this spell is a nut shell from  a  tree  standing
alone in a field or plain, picked on a new moon, using a clean, white glove.

This  spell is similar to fireball, except that it douses all creatures in  a
15-foot  radius sphere with an incendiary liquid. Everything and  all  within
the  area of effect will be engulfed in non-magical fire for 1d6 rounds.  Any
combustibles  within the area of effect instantly ignite. A creature  in  the
area  of  effect that fails its saving throw takes 1d4 HP of fire damage  per
level  of  the wizard on the first round, and the same damage each subsequent
round,  until  it saves. The round the creature saves it takes  half  damage,
rounded  down,  and  the next round it takes none. All  the  creature's  non-
combustible  possessions must save versus normal fire or  be  destroyed  (the
combustible  ones  don't  get a saving throw). A creature  that  successfully
saves  on  the  first  round takes half damage for that round,  and  all  its
possessions (including combustibles) are unaffected.
For  example,  a  creature failing its first saving  throw  against  Pilpin's
liquid  fire, cast by a 12th-level wizard, takes 32 HP of damage  (rolled  on
12d4)  on the first round. The creature fails its saving throw again  on  the
second  round and takes another 32 HP of damage. On the third round it  saves
and only takes 16 HP of damage and no damage on the fourth round.
The  wizard must have a clear line of sight to the target area. The  material
components  are a pinch of sulphur and the distillate of softly  boiled  lamp
oil (dangerous to get).

      This  spell will create a map of the wizard's path for the duration  of
the  spell.  The  map  will  record basic features (doors,  stairs,  windows,
cliffs, rivers, etc.) on a piece of vellum provided by the wizard. Unusual or
special features (statues, paintings, smells, annoises, for example)  can  be
added  at  the  will of the wizard. The material components are  a  piece  of
vellum (that the map is created on) and a vial of ink. Neither is consumed in
the casting, except for some drops of ink.

This spell is exactly the same as the 4th-level spell polymorph other, except
that  there is no saving throw, it only affects creature with less  than  8+3
HD,  and  it may affect many creatures simultaneously. Like death spell,  the
numbof creatures that can be affected is a function of their Hit Dice.

     Creature's Hit Dice Number of Creatures Affected
     up to 2   12d10
     2 to 4    6d10
     4+1 to 6+3     3d4
     6+4 to 8+3     1d6

If  creatures  of differing Hit Dice are polymorphed, roll 6d20 to  determine
now  many  creatures  of under 2 HD are affected. If  the  number  rolled  is
greater than the number of creatures under 2 HD, apply the remainder  of  the
roll  to  the  higher  Hit Dice creatures by using the  following  conversion
factors (see Death Spell for an example of this idea).

     Creature's Hit Dice Conversion Factor
     up to 2   1
     2 to 4    2
     4+1 to 6+3     10
     6+4 to 8+3     20

The material components are a 500 gp worth diamond and a caterpillar's cocoon
crushed together into a fine powder, which vanishes during casting.

This  spell  allows  the wizard to enter a creature's dream  and  attempt  to
control it, but the spell can backfire and destroy the wizard. Creatures that
do  not  dream  are not affected by this spell (i.e., undead, non-intelligent
monsters,  etc.). The creature must have been asleep for at  least  one  hour
before the spell will work.
The  wizard  goes  into a deep trance for the duration of the  spell  and  is
totally oblivious to the surrounding environment. If the wizard is disturbed,
the spell ends.
The  wizard  projects from the trance into the creature's dream.  The  wizard
will appear in the dream as an observer, unable to influence the dream or say
anything.  There is a 5% chance that the dream projected into is  hostile  to
the wizard (see below for the effects of a dream hostile to the wizard).
Once  in  the  dream, the wizard attempts to take control of the  dream.  The
target  creature  is  allowed a saving throw at -4  to  resist  the  wizard's
attempt.  If this first saving throw is successful, the wizard does not  take
control  of  the  dream and cannot try again for a week. At this  point,  the
wizard  can leave, or remain as an observer. If the wizard chooses to remain,
there is a 5% chance per round that the dream turns hostile to the wizard. If
the  creature fails the saving throw, the wizard takes control of  the  dream
and can make anything happen in that dream. If the wizard causes the dream to
become  hostile  to  the creature (i.e.: turning it into  a  nightmare),  the
target  creature must make a saving throw versus death magic or  die  in  its
sleep. If the creature's saving throw is successful, the wizard loses control
of  the  dream, but the target creature still takes physical damage equal  to
25% of its maximum hit points. The target creature will not awaken due to the
physical  damage caused by the nightmare, but may be awaken by  another,  who
witnesses the damage suddenly appearing on the creature.
After  the first attempt at turning the dream to a nightmare there is  a  50%
chance  that  the  dream turns hostile to the wizard. The  wizard  can  again
attempt  to take control of the dream or leave. If the wizard regains control
of  the  dream, he can again attempt to kill the target. If the target  saves
versus  death  magic again, the wizard loses control of  the  dream  and  the
target  takes another 25% of its maximum hit points in damage. The dream  now
automatically turns hostile to the wizard.
The wizard can continue to go through this, each time the creature can either
fail  its saving throw and die, or successfully save and take 25% of its  hit
points  in damage. If the target creature saves and takes damage four  times,
it dies from physical damage.
If  at any time the dream turns hostile to the wizard, the wizard can attempt
to  control the dream in the usual manner, or attempt to leave the dream.  If
the  wizard  chooses  to  leave, a successful saving throw  versus  spell  is
required  (leaving a non-hostile dream does not require a saving  throw),  if
the  saving  throw fails, the wizard is trapped. If the wizard unsuccessfully
attempts  to control the dream (i.e., the target saves against the  attempt),
the wizard is trapped.
A  wizard trapped in a dream hostile to himself cannot make the dream hostile
to  the  target  again and must make a successful saving throw  versus  death
magic  or die for each round trapped. If the saving throw is successful,  the
wizard loses 25% of his hit points due to physical damage (a wise wizard will
have  somebody watching in case this starts to happen). If the wizard is  not
awoke  by another, he must regain control of the dream before he can  attempt
escape. If unsuccessful in gaining control of the dream, the wizard will  die
in four rounds from physical damage, if not sooner from a failed saving throw
versus death magic.

The  material  components are a personal possession from the target  creature
and a lock of hair from a night hag.

Pilpin, a greedy and jealous individual, saw that priests could imbue  spells
upon  their followers. He decided that this ability could be used to increase
his  personal  power and reach, as it has. This spell allows  the  wizard  to
transfer  a  number  of spells, and the ability to cast them,  to  a  another
person.  Only non-wizards (including rangers under eighth level and  paladins
under  ninth) with a minimum Intelligence of 9 and at least one Hit  Die  can
receive  this  enchantment. The number and level of  the  spells  transferred
depend on the recipient's level as follows:

     Level of Recipient  Spells transferred
     1-2  One 1st-level spell
     3-4  Two 1st-level spells
     5-6  Two 1st- and one 2nd-level spells
     7+   Two 1st- and two 2nd-level spells

Only  spells with casting times up to 1 round can be transferred (i.e.,  find
familiar,  identify, Leomund's trap, strength, etc. cannot  be  transferred).
The  transferred  spells variable characteristics (range, duration,  area  of
effect,  etc.)  function  according to the level  of  the  wizard  originally
transferring the spell.
A  wizard who transfers spells to another creature loses the number of spells
he  has  transferred until the recipient casts the transferred spells  or  is
slain.  For  example, a 9th-level wizard with four 1st- and  three  2nd-level
spells transfers magic missile, charm person, and invisibility to a 6th-level
thief.  The wizard now has only two 1st- and two 2nd-level spells, until  the
thief  casts some of the transferred spells. If the thief casts magic missile
and  invisibility, the wizard now has three 1st- and all his 2nd-level spells
(three).
The  casting  time  is 1 turn plus 1 round for every spell  transferred.  The
material components are a drop of the wizard's and recipient's blood.

This spell is an enhancement of the 2nd-level spell flaming sphere. The spell
creates  one  burning globe of fire per level of the wizard. The  globes  all
appear  within  30  yards of the wizard and roll in whichever  direction  the
wizard  points, at a rate of 100 yards per round. The spheres can  roll  over
any obstacle, even a city wall. Combustible substances are ignited by contact
with  a sphere. Creatures contacting a sphere must successfully roll a saving
throw  versus spell or suffer 2d4 HP of damage. Those within five feet  of  a
sphere  must  also  save or suffer 1d4 points of damage. A successful  saving
throw means no damage is suffered.
The  spheres move in the direction the wizard directs, otherwise the  spheres
will  wander aimlessly. Spheres can be extinguished by the same means as  any
normal  fire of their size. The surface of the spheres has a spongy, yielding
consistency  and does not cause damage except by its flames. It  cannot  push
unwilling creatures aside or batter down large obstacles.
If  the  spell is unleashed on a large source of easily combustible  material
(such as a city of at least 50% wooden buildings or a dry forest) there is  a
25%  chance  that  a fire storm will start. A fire storm  will  burn  out  of
control  for many days until at least 90% of the combustibles are burned.  It
will also be so hot that it will melt soft metals and crack thin stone walls.

The material components are a pinch of sulphur, a bit of tallow, a dusting of
powdered  iron, and a live fire dwelling or fire using creature,  such  as  a
fire beetle or fire bat, which must be slain during casting.

This  scauses the life forces of two creatures to exchange. The  wizard  must
touch  both creatures simultaneously at the end of casting without having  to
make  a  to-hit  roll. Any two creatures with a soul or spirit (eg.,  humans,
elves,  animals,  birds, dragons, fish, etc.) can be  affected.  Examples  of
creatures  that  do  not have souls or spirits (as we understand  them)  are:
undead, demons, devils, automatons such as golems, and extra-planar creatures
in general.
The saving throw against Pilpin's soul exchange depends on whether both, one,
or  neither  of  the  recipients are willing to undergo the  exchange.  Treat
indifferent as unwilling. If both recipients are willing, no saving throw  is
required.  If  one  recipient  is willing but the  other  is  not,  then  the
unwilling  target is allowed a saving throw with a -2 penalty.  If  both  are
unwilling,  then  they are both allowed a normal saving throw.  A  successful
saving throw by any one of the recipients negates the spell.
This  spell is much more powerful when used in combination with the 8th-level
trap  the soul. Unwilling creatures that are trapped within a gem prison have
an  additional  -6  penalty on their saving throw. So  if  one  recipient  is
willing and the other not, and the unwilling recipient is first imprisoned by
trap  the  soul,  the  unwilling creature saves with a -8  penalty.  If  both
recipients are unwilling and trapped in gem prisons, they both save with a -6
penalty. The spell does not release them from the gem prisons, only exchanges
their souls.
A creature's soul in a different body has that body's hit points or Hit Dice,
Strength,   Dexterity,   Constitution,  and  Comeliness,   but   the   soul's
Intelligence,  Wisdom,  Charisma (modified by  the  body's  new  Comeliness),
memories,  and Intelligence based skills (languages, nonweapon proficiencies,
spellcasting ability, etc.). The non-physical abilities can be used  only  if
the  body has the required physical attributes. If the body has extraordinary
Strength, it can only be used if a warrior's soul enters the body.  The  body
will  not radiate magic. The alignment will be that of the soul. True  seeing
will  reveal  to  a  person that previously knew the recipient  of  the  soul
exchange that it is no longer the same person.
The  spell  can  only  be reversed by a carefully worded  and  executed  wish
(creatures must be touching each other), another soul exchange, or  the  will
of  the  original wizard. If a creature dies while in another's body, it  can
only  be brought back with its own body, so if both creatures died this could
be a reckless way to reverse the spell. The material components are a diamond
worth  1000  gp  and  a bit of fresh brain tissue from  a  mind  flayer  (not
necessarily freshly acquired, possibly magically preserved).

Pilpin,  a  formidable fighter/mage, had no need for Tenser's transformation,
so  he  altered  it  to suit his own malevolent ways. This spell  causes  the
wizard  to undergo an unnoticeable transformation, becoming an assassin.  The
wizard's hit points do not change, but his Dexterity does increase to 16,  or
if already 16, it becomes one higher, to a maximum of 18. The wizard's Armour
Class is adjusted accordingly.
The  wizard gains all the abilities of an assassin (pick pockets, open locks,
backstabbing, assassination, etc.) of the same level as the wizard except for
poison  making, disguise, and spying. All attacks are made using  the  combat
values  normally reserved for rogues, but the wizard can only use his  normal
weapons of proficiency.

The  material  component is the heart of an assassin,  which  must  be  eaten
during casting.

     This cantrip sounds a perfectly-tuned note from out of nowhere. The note
is centred on the wizard, and can be heard from a distance of 20 feet. Things
that  block  normal  noise (walls, curtains, silence, 15-foot  radius,  etc.)
block this as well.

      This spell is useful for tuning instruments "by ear", or with the  help
of a tune cantrip. It is also slightly disturbing to those around the wizard,
as any single note would be if held out for two rounds.

      To cast this cantrip, the bard must speak out loud the name of the note
he  wishes to hear, such as "middle C", "B flat", or "quarter-step above  the
first F sharp above high C".

This  spell  causes  an outer plane of existence, or a  pocket  dimension  to
become unstable to a varying degree. The caster must be on the intended plane
for  the spell to function. The spell does not affect portable holes  or  any
extra-dimensional device in any way.
When  this spell is cast in a pocket dimension, the pocket will automatically
disintegrate,  throwing its entire contents, including the caster,  into  the
astral plane.
When cast on an outer plane, this spell will cause a rippling earthquake that
will  shake  the entire dimension for several rounds. To determine additional
effects at the time of casting, the following table is consulted:

     D100 Roll Spell's Effect
     01-14     Quake only
     15-21     Quake, half of gravity is lost
     22-28     Quake, all gravity is lost
     29-38     Quake, gravity lost, spells below fifth level do not function
     39-51     Quake, gravity lost, spells below tenth level do not function
      52-71      Quake, gravity lost, spells are lost, magic items at  normal
ability
      72-89      Quake, gravity lost, spells lost, magic items that  are  not
artifacts do not function
     90-99     Quake, gravity lost, spells lost, magic items do not function,
breathable atmosphere lost
     00   Plane disintegrates

The  spell  does  not affect the astral, ethereal, border  ethereal,  shadow,
positive, negative, elemental, or prime material planes of existence. It will
affect,  for example, one of the planes of Gehennom, one of the two Twins  of
Paradise, or the plane of Nirvana.
If  the  spell is cast and the effect roll is 15 to 99, where the  plane  has
been damaged beyond the brief quake, but has not been completely destroyed, a
second planar disruption will automatically disintegrate the plane.
Obviously,  the caster will have several escape possibilities at hand  before
the  spell  is  cast.  However, if the effect  roll  is  00,  the  caster  is
automatically  thrown into the astral plane, with the other items  from  that
plane, and is dead.

The  material  components are a piece of "inner granite" from  the  elemental
plane  of  earth  (which is crushed during thespell) and  a  sanctified  holy
symbol from the head god of the present pantheon.

This  spell  has  the power to open a planar gateway to another  plane  -  no
matter where the caster is right now. Thus, it is a highly sought spell.  The
casting  time  can become quite prodigious (as you will see) but  it  can  be
shortened  by a very complicated ritual. This gate is under no one's  control
and anything can pass through, in both directions. First, the duration of the
spell  must be chosen by the wizard. The casting time must then be calculated
from  the planar layer to be reached and the current location of the  caster,
as follows: a gateway from the prime material to another prime material plane
takes one hour of casting time per round open (if the duration was stated  in
rounds), one day of casting time per hour open (if the duration was stated in
hours), or one month casting time per day open otherwise.
From  the  prime material plane to an inner plane, for every plane or  planar
layer  traversed, multiply by two. From the prime material plane to an  outer
plane,  for every plane or planar layer traversed, multiply by five. From  an
inner  to  an  outer plane, for every plane or planar layer times  traversed,
multiply  by  ten.  From  an  outer plane to an  outer  plane  you  need  the
permission  of a god on both planes. Then, the casting time is multiplied  by
one  hundred. As a character can normally only cast for some 16 hours per day
the  actual casting time will be even longer (unless the character is willing
to give up experience levels: see below).
For  example, a gateway from the prime material plane to the second level  of
Hades that is supposed to stay open for 3 days has a normal casting time of 1
month  per  day open = 3 months, times 5 times 4 (astral, concordant,  Hades'
first level, Hades' second level) = 3 months times 20 = 60 months or a full 5
years.
The  casting time can be reduced: for every experience level offered  in  the
casting, the casting time is reduced by a factor of « (rounding up)  until  a
value of one is reached. After that, the time can be further reduced by «  if
5  more  levels  are  offered for each further reduction  until  the  minimum
casting time of 1 round is reached.
Example continued: we eventually calculated a casting time of 60 months. This
can  be  reduced by one half for every level offered. Thus, if our  character
offered 6 levels this would be reduced to 30, 15, 7« (rounded up to 8), 4, 2,
and  1  by halving six times. Still quite long, but manageable. The character
still has to be able to cast 9th-level spells after offering those levels, as
the  levels are drained at the beginning of the casting. Note that this might
reduce the maximum duration. As the example above has shown, opening gateways
for  a long time can take an even longer time or many hard earned levels.  As
the  character  has offered the levels voluntarily, they cannot  be  regained
with  restoration, but only with a full wish per level lost. Thus, it is  not
very  often that planar gateways are opened from an outer plane to  an  outer
plane,  but  if  they are opened they are opened with a lot of  power  behind
them.

The material components are solidified essence of the target plane, para-  or
quasi-elemental planes are considered to be one with their parent plane  (you
would  need  frozen  ice to open a gateway to the plane  of  water,  ice,  or
sludge),  plus  a full gallon of blood (or another appropriate  liquid)  from
inhabitants of the target plane.

This spell counters the effects of planar disruption (q.v.). Only planes that
have been damaged, not totally destroyed, can be healed by this spell.
The  spell will return the recipient plane to the physical status it  was  in
before  planar disruption was cast. The caster must be on the plane  that  is
being stabilized.

The material components for the spell are a piece of "inner granite" from the
elemental  plane  of earth, a 3-inch solid ivory cube, and a sanctified  holy
symbol of the primary god of law.

This power allows the psionicist to thrust themselves into another
plane.   This  is almost the same as Summon Planar  Creature,  but
involves  a  different  type of usage.  As with  that  power,  the
psionicist  is disoriented for one round, causing a -2 penalty  on
initiative, attacks, and saving throws.  The psionicist can choose
any of the inner planes for 45 PSP as well as the astral plane  or
the  ethereal plane, or any outer plane for 90 PSP.  If the  power
check  is  a  2, then the psionicist is off target  by  one  plane
(which  direction is up to the DM)  If the power check is  a  one,
then  the psionicist not only misses by one plane, but also  takes
the nearest being to him with him.  This power does not confer ant
protection  from  the  plane transported to.   If  the  psionicist
misses  in the outer planes, they are ALWAYS transported to  Sigil
(if PlaneScape is used, if not use the Concordant Opposition.)

Power  Score:   The psionicist ends up in a safe area,  no  matter
where  they  went to.  However, this does not guarantee  that  the
place  will  REMAIN safe.  A cool spot in the elemental  plane  of
fire does not last long.

20:    The   psionicist  instead  summons  a  creature  from   the
destination  plane.  Roll again as per Summon Planar  Creature  to
see the exact distance and disposition of the creature.

Using  this spell, the priest can perceive creatures in the Border  Ethereal,
out  of phase beings (eg., phase spiders), dimension doors, creatures viewing
his location through colour pools, and boundaries of planetravel-proof areas;
he can also identify portals to other planes (but he cannot say what plane is
on the other side).

This  spell is similar to the 5th-level priest spell plane shift. The  caster
can  shift  up  to seven other people with himself to another plane,  or  can
attempt to use it in combat against an unwilling target. If used in combat, a
successful  to-hit roll is required and the target also gets a  saving  throw
against  spells  to avoid the effect. The spell only shifts  to  an  adjacent
plane.  For example, if cast from the prime material one can only go  to  the
astral  or  the ethereal. If cast from the astral one can go to  any  of  the
outer planes, but only to the uppermost layer. Further, unless the caster has
actually  been  to  the  plane or has scried it, the arrival  point  will  be
random.  If  the  caster has been to or scried the desired  location  on  the
plane,  the arrival point will be 0-99 miles from the desired location  (this
applies when plane shifting home as well).

This  science  allows  the psionicist to  control  plants  of  all
varieties.   It  allows  him to animate the   plant  and  have  it
perform  simple tasks.  For example, Belor needs to  get  a  wagon
through  the forest, but there is not path and trees are  blocking
the  way.   With  this science Belor could contact the  trees  and
command  them to move.  Obviously there will be a few potholes  to
maneuver  around,  but that's ok.  A character  with  a  non  evil
alignment  would  also  command the trees  to  replant  themselves
somewhere  else  out  of the way.  Treants  are  immune  to  plant
control,  because they are not considered to be  plants  for  game
purposes.

Power Score:  He may control intelligent plants.

20:  He gains plant intelligence for duration of power.

This spell is similar to animal growth   it does the same thing to plant-like
monsters. It doubles their size, Hit Dice, number of attacks, movement  rate,
damage  per attack, etc. Thus, a treant of 20 feet height, 12 HD, one attack,
3d8  hit  points damage, and a movement rate of 6 becomes a giant of 40  feet
height, 24 HD, two attacks, causes 6d8 hit points damage per attack and has a
movement  rate of 12. Any hit points damage are first deducted from  the  new
Hit  Dice.  Thus, if the spell runs out, the plant-like creature could  still
have  its  full normal hit points. If this spell is used in conjunction  with
the ordinary plant growth, then all times of hacking through are doubled, and
the  plants won't burn unless fireball or a similarly high powered  spell  is
applied. If something is caught in these enormous plants, the creatures would
have  to  be of truly enormous size (a rhinoceros wouldn't be able  to  break
through  such  a jungle but a great wyrm might, if he makes his saving  throw
magic  resistance  doesn't work). The reverse, plant  shrinking  II,  reduces
plant size by half.
The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a part
of  the plant type to be affected. This part has to be rubbed with a complete
potion of growth.

This  spell,  when cast, will detect and instantly alert the wizard  whenever
the  wizard  is  the  subject of information-gathering spells  or  divination
spells such as ESP or know alignment. The wizard will have a general idea  of
what is being used (mind reading, truth detection, etc.) upon him.
The  reverse  of the spell, Pobithakor's soothing, will cause the  wizard  to
have  no  chance to discover that such spells are being used upon him,  i.e.,
the wizard would not be able to detect someone scrying upon him.

This  spell  is  used when the wizard is the subject of Pobithakor's  placer.
What  this spell does is disrupts the energies and allows the wizard a saving
throw  versus spell to avoid the effect. There is enough time when the wizard
is being pulled through to cast this spell.
The  verbal component varies, but usually sounds something like "not tonight,
I have a headache" or "not on the first date".

This spell is similar to Pobithakor's tracer, for not only does it allow  the
two-way  scrying,  but the wizard has the additional option  of  pulling  the
scrying  creature  through  the two-way portal right  next  to  the  wizard's
current  location. The creature gets no saving throw and the  process  occurs
almost  instantly.  Unless  special measures are taken,  the  wizard  has  no
control over the creature when it arrives.
This  was another spell used by the paranoid wizard when he felt his defenses
being compromised.

This  is  an  improved version of Pobithakor's pacifier. When the  wizard  is
affected by Pobithakor's placer, this spell can be cast so that the wizard is
not  pulled to the wizard's location. This spell simply stops the effect from
occurring at all.
This  spell can also be cast to return a scrying portal to one-way only after
it  has  been  affected by Pobithakor's tracer without having  to  resort  to
dispel magic.

This  spell  was created by an archmage known as Pobithakor the  Powerful,  a
wizard  who  was  better  known  as Pobithakor  the  Paranoid.  His  fear  of
absolutely  everything  around him drove him  to  take  extreme  measures  to
protect himself.
This  spell  is  cast when the wizard is being scried upon (see  the  Dungeon
Master's Guide on Detection of Scrying, page 141).
If  a  wizard  detects that he is being scried upon, by any means,  then  the
spell  can  be cast. This spell causes the scrying device to become  two-way.
Not only does the scrying creature see the wizard, but the wizard can see the
scrying  creature.  Also, whatever powers the scrying  device  has,  such  as
clairaudience,  the spell also gives the wizard such powers.  The  range  and
area  of effect are those of the scrying device itself. The duration is  that
of  the scrying device. Once the wizard breaks off contact the spell ends. If
the  scrying creature breaks off contact, the wizard can still scry up to the
maximum  duration  of  the scrying device. The wizard will  receive  all  the
information inside his head.
If  the scrying creature becomes aware that he is being scried upon and  then
casts  a  dispel magic, the spell will end, but his own scrying  device  will
become  unusable  for  one  day. If the scrying creature  casts  Pobithakor's
protection,  Pobithakor's tracer will end and the creature's  scrying  device
will be usable.
This  spell  can  be  a  useful  device  for  long  range  communication  for
prearranged meetings between two people.

Similar  to  a strength spell, this spell causes an increase of a character's
Dexterity  for a limited duration. The spell will never increase a  Dexterity
rating  score  beyond the maximum values set by race and sex. The  amount  of
increase depends on the class of the character affected:

     Class     Dexterity gain
     Fighter   1d6
     Priest    1d4
     Thief     1d8
     Wizard    1d6

For  multi-class characters and characters with two classes, roll the die for
whichever class is most favourable. The material component of this spell is a
set of three small balls.

This  spell  is actually a two-in-one spell. With this spell the  priest  can
simulate the effect of poison ivy in a very short time. The two versions  are
very different in application.
Version  1. This version is cast at a thicket of plants and gives the  plants
the abilities of real poison ivy with no change of their appearance. The area
that  can be affected is a 20-foot square per level. Anyone in this  area  at
the  time of casting has to save versus poison or be affected at the  fullest
effect of the poison ivy. Anyone who succeeds won't notice anything for an on-
set  time  of 2d4 rounds. After that a strong rash will break out,  which  is
very uncomfortable and causes a  1 to-hit and damage, any thief will have all
his  manual  abilities reduced by 15%, and any spell caster will have  a  15%
chance for loosing their concentration per round after an initiative roll for
the  rash, for the duration of the rash, which lasts for 2d4 days or until  a
cure  disease is cast on the character. If the characters fail to  save,  the
rash  breaks out after one round, and the characters won't be able  to  fight
effectively  (parrying is possible) or cast any spells with a longer  casting
time  than  a 1 initiative modifier (even for these there is a 15% chance  of
failing),  nor are thieves able to successfully use their abilities  for  the
duration  of the rash. This rash lasts as long as the rash above. The  plants
that  are affected by this spell keep their poisonous effect for 1 round  per
level  of  the  caster. This effect can also affect the caster if  he  passes
through the area of effect.
Version  2.  This version is cast on the caster. With this spell he  gains  a
very  high powered but short lived poison ivy touch. They have to apply  this
power  with  a  to-hit roll in combat. If they hit, their  opponents  gain  a
saving  throw versus poison. If they succeed, they feel a light rash  develop
which  is  irritating but not damaging (the effects are same as above  for  a
succeeded  saving  throw) for the duration of one  round  per  level  of  the
caster.  If  the  opponent fails the saving throw, they immediately  collapse
with  an  urgent  desire  to scratch that horrible itch.  They  cannot  fight
effectively nor can they cast spells or use thief abilities until the rash is
gone  (either  naturally or by cure disease). During this devastating  poison
ivy effect, the character loses one hit point per round due to scratched open
skin  and  bleeding open rashes. The rash lasts for 5 rounds per level.  Once
the  caster  has  affected one opponent with this spell, the  spell  is  gone
whether  the saving throw succeeded or not. The caster himself is  immune  to
the  effect  of  his own spell in this version, even if he fumbles  and  hits
himself.
The  material components are a highly concentrated extract of poison ivy  and
the holy symbol of the priest.

This  spell  changes  a small portion of food or drink  into  deadly  poison.
Anyone eating or drinking even a small portion of the poisoned substance must
save versus poison or die in 3d4 rounds. The spell affects all food and drink
in  a  10x10-foot square. If the drink affected is part of a larger  body  of
liquid (only part of a wine keg is in the area), then the poison in this item
will either have a reduced effect, or no effect (DM's discretion). This spell
cannot  be  used to create pure poison. Already poisoned substances  are  not
affected,  even if the poison contained is much weaker than the  poison  that
would be created by this spell.

This  spell  is  similar to polymorph other except that target creatures  can
only be turned into trees (usually oak). All creatures get a saving throw  to
avoid  the  effects of this spell. Those who fail turn into trees with  their
minds  trapped  within. Clothing, possessions, etc., are not  transformed  as
part of the spell. Those who save feel their limbs turn wooden and stiff, the
effects being as if a slow spell were cast upon them, with duration 2  rounds
per level of the priest.
To  cast this spell, the priest needs a sprig of holly and tree sap from  the
tree  type to which the targets are being polymorphed into. Only a wish or  a
higher level priest can reverse the effects of this spell.

      Population Finder allows one celestial body to be  examined.
If successful, the power locates the highest population centers (5
per  round) on that body.  The power also reveals a rough estimate
of  the  populations (several million, several  thousand,  greater
than  100,  etc.).  Alternatively, the psionicist can think  of  a
specific  population size (like 5'000 people) and know  where  the
closest matching population center lies.
Raqnge: Within 1 mile of atmosphere (or where it would be,  should
the body not have one.

Power  Score:   Receives a brief summary of what one city/area  is

By  use of this spell, the priest is able to project his spirit into that  of
an animal, forcing the creature to behave according to his will. The creature
must be a normal creature and have fewer Hit Dice than the priest. The animal
is  allowed a saving throw versus spell and, if successful, the spell has  no
effect.  Once the animal is possessed, the priest can cause it to do anything
within  its  ability, regardless of the consequences to the animal.  However,
for every hit point of damage suffered by the animal, the priest suffers half
a  hit  point of damage. In addition, should the animal die while  under  the
control  of  the  priest, a system shock roll must be made. If  the  roll  is
failed, the priest also dies. While controlling the animal, the priest's body
enters  a  catatonic state. If the body is disturbed or moved, the  spell  is
disrupted.  The material component for this spell is a holly  leaf  and  some
hair from the animal.

This  science  is  similar to the science switch personality.   It
allows  a  psionicist to possess an individuals body, without  the
risk  of  losing his own.  It requires a gem worth a   1,000gp  or
more to store the individuals mind in while the psionicist barrows
its  body.  Here's how it works.  The psionicist takes the gem  in
one  hand  and touches the victim with the other.  The  psionicist
pays  the  initial 80 PSPs and the victims mind is transferred  to
the gem at a rate of one of the victims levels or hit die a round.
If  the  psionicist  releases the victim or  the  gem  before  the
transfer  is complete the victims mind snaps back and the  process
must be started over from the beginning.  Once the victims mind is
completely  transferred to the gem the psionicist  is  transferred
into the victims body in one round. (It takes longer to put a mind
into  a  gem then into an empty body.)  The transfer is considered
permanent, and lasts until the psionicist uses this science  again
to  reverse  it.  The psionicist does not suffer any  ill  affects
form  the  transfer and is able to function without any  problems.
His  old  body will live for one week with no mind in it.    After
the  week has passed the psionicist must either transfer  back  to
his own body or it dies.  The psionicist will require a large meal
and  a day of rest if he stays out of his body for the entire week
and  then  reenters  it.  When the psionicist leaves  his  victims
body,  no matter where the gem is located at the time, the victims
mind  will snap back to it's body form inside the gem, unaware  of
any  time passing.  A gem may be used more then once, but  it  can
never hold more than one mind at a time.
      The  psionicist  gains  the physical  attributes  (Strength,
Constitution, and Dexterity) of his victim.  However,  he  retains
his own THAC0, proficiencies, and so forth.  Any creature that can
be  contacted  can  be  possessed, with the exception  of  plants,
unless the plant has a localized brain.

Power Score:  The initial cost is reduced to contact +40.

20:   The  psionicist is trapped in the gem for 1D6 days and  then
snaps back to his own body.  (If the psionicist body is dead  then
the psionicist mind is lost in the transfer back.  (Your dead.))

This  power allows a psionicist to "postpone" a power till a later
point  in  time.  This consists of the psionicist having to  first
make  the power check to initiate the power, then having  to  make
the  postpone  power check.  When the psionicist makes  the  power
roll  for  the first power, he pays he initial cost of the  power,
them when he initiates post pone he pays the same cost again.  The
power  that is postponed is "put on the back burner" till a  later
point  in time, when the psionicist wants to use the power he  has
postponed.   This  power will allow a psionicist to  maintain  any
power  he can use at the time (even if he can only use because  of
convergence,if he can use it he can post pone it),  this  includes
both once and done power, and maintainable powers.  This power has
a  serious  draw  back  while  a power  is  being  maintained  the
psionicist  can not get back ANY PSPs due to the fact that  he  is
using a power at that time (spending exactly 1 PSP per hour).

Power Score:  If a power score is rolled this power only uses half
the  normal  PSPs to maintain, and in so doing allows a psionicist
to  regain PSPs every other hour (depending upon whether or not he
rests)

20:  The power is disrupted and the psionicist must begin again to
try to postpone the power.

Power  booster  is  a  spell that boosts the level of the  caster  for  spell
effects  only. It does not increase the number of spells a caster may  learn.
Thus, a spell's range, duration, area of effect, etc. might be boosted.  This
spell  works  only  for  those  parts of the spell  that  are  already  level
dependent,  i.e.,  the  range of an ice storm might be  increased  while  the
damage  remains the same. All spells to be boosted have to be started  -  not
necessarily finished - during the duration of power booster. This  particular
version of power booster can boost spells of up to third level.
The boosting process works as follows: the recipient receives one boost level
per 2 caster levels (rounding up). Each boost level can boost one spell level
of  spells  by  one casting level. Thus, boosting a 1st-level  spell  by  one
caster  level  requires one booster level, a 2nd-level spell boosted  by  one
caster level costs two booster levels, and so forth. It is possible to  boost
a single spell by more than one caster level.
An  example:  a 9th-level wizard receives 5 boost levels forcasting  a  power
booster I with which he could choose to boost:
          a single 1st-level spell by five caster levels,
          five 1st-level spells by one caster level each,
           two  2nd-level  spells by one caster level (and have  one  booster
level left over),
          one 2nd-level spell by two caster levels and one 1st-level spell by
one level,
           one  3rd-level  spell by one caster level (and  have  two  booster
levels left over),
          any other combination which adds up to five or less booster levels.
Any left over booster levels can be used for another spell.
The  boosted spells break the rules concerning the normal damage dice  limits
for  spells like fireball or such: a fireball boosted by 10 levels  gains  10
dice  over  the  normal maximum of 10d6 HP of damage. Thus, if  the  original
caster  was of tenth level, we would see a full-fledged 20d6 fireball  flying
around.
The  boosted  spells  have  a  longer casting time.  A  spell  which  has  an
initiative  modifier  has this increased by one for  every  increase  of  the
caster's level. If this increase pushes the casting time over 10 then  change
the  casting  time to one round for every 10 increments plus  the  additional
time as an initiative modifier. For example, boosting a 1st-level spell which
had  an  initiative modifier of 1 by 24 caster levels, you get a  spell  that
takes  2 rounds to cast and another initiative modifier of 5 in round  three.
Other  spells that have casting times measured in rounds, turns, hours, days,
weeks, etc. have their casting time increased by a further one unit for every
caster level increase. For example, a find familiar spell takes up to 1  hour
per  caster level normally - if boosted by 6 caster levels it takes the usual
time  plus 6 hours. It is not possible to store power boosted spells in items
such  as rings, ioun stones, staves, etc. without a certain ritual. If  tried
without the ritual, these items immediately explode on the person trying this
as  a  caster  does who has booster levels in him at the end of  the  spell's
duration (see below).
The power booster spells can be stacked with each other (but don't forget the
limit  for  the  spells to be boosted) up to a maximum of one  power  booster
spell  per  caster  level. And yes, you can use the power booster  spells  to
boost  your levels to hold more power booster spells, ad infinitum...  It  is
not  possible  to  stack booster or spell levels from spells  cast  by  other
wizards.
A  cautionary  note: a spell cannot be boosted only partially:  you  have  to
either  give  up  every  required booster level or you  have  to  reduce  the
increase in caster level to the next possible lower one. So this leads us  to
the  next problem: if any booster levels remain within the caster at the  end
of  the  duration of a power booster and no other spell is in the process  of
being  cast  with the help of a power booster, the situation can  grow  quite
dangerous.  For  every  booster level in the character  at  the  end  of  the
duration, the character has to make a saving throw versus spell and a  saving
throw  versus  paralysation. For each failed saving throw versus  spell,  the
character  receives  1d6 HP of damage. For every failed saving  throw  versus
paralysation,  the character loses one point of either Intelligence,  Wisdom,
Constitution or Charisma permanently until they reach a minimum of 2  (always
reduce the highest ability first). Thus, this character could in the long run
be damaged massively by frequent use of this spell. By the way, if you dispel
these spells and a character has booster levels still remaining in him, well,
tough luck, roll your saving throws... So you should not cast dispel magic on
yourself  if  you  have just stacked up well over 50 or  60  boosted  levels,
because that could hurt quite a bit.

The material components for this spell are rather expensive: one 4000 gp ruby
plus  one freshly taken drop of blood from the caster for each booster level,
plus  a  single  freshly ripped out hair from the casters  head  to  be  tied
completely  around each ruby. All material components radiate a strong  magic
which prevents them from being destroyed, altered, reused, or changed in  any
way,  until  the  durations of all power booster spells on  the  person  have
ended.  The  components can be given away in this enchanted state,  but  they
cannot  be  used for this or any other spell. If tried, the other spell  will
fail.

This  spell can be used to drain someone else's Constitution permanently  and
use this energy for certain spells such as permanency. To do this, the wizard
casts  the  spell  and  touches the subject, who gets a saving  throw  versus
spell.  If the saving throw fails, 1 point of Constitution of the subject  is
drained  and  stored in the material component: a 1000 gp  black  opal.  This
energy  must then be used within the spell's duration or it is lost  forever.
When  the  point  is used or the spell ends, the opal disintegrates.  Casting
this  spell is very tiring for the wizard, causing him to lose 1d6 points  of
Constitution that can be regained by having 3 hours of rest for  every  point
lost.

This  spell  creates a link between the wizard and the victim  through  which
magical  energy  can  flow. Thus the wizard can cast spells  centred  on  the
recipient,  as  if  he  were a projected image. Also, the  wizard  can  route
malevolent  spell side-effects, such as magical ageing, to  the  victim.  The
material  components  of  the spell are a chip  of  jet,  an  herbal  tea  of
spearmint  and  devil's dung, and a wooden disc. The  recipient  must  be  an
intelligent, living native of the wizard's home plane.

This spell was designed as a counter-spell to the 1st-level sleep spell. A DM
with  whom  I played ruled that sleep's targets had to be kicked  or  somehow
given at least a point of damage to be woken from the slumber.
The  wizard must pick a living creature within the area of effect (see below)
for the spell. When the power word is spoken, that target will be subject  to
the  effects  of  the  power word as listed below.  In  addition,  twice  the
wizard's  level of Hit Dice of creatures within 1d3 feet + 5 feet per  level,
will  also  be affected, starting with the closest creature. These  creatures
may  be either asleep or awake, since the spell's effects are not limited  to
sleeping creatures.
The spell causes an effect like a sudden rush of adrenaline to the creatures.
If  the  creatures are asleep, either magically or normally, the  Power  Word
will  wake  them from their slumber. The sleeping creatures will  be  up  and
ready  for  action  half  a round later. There is no saving  throw,  and  the
creatures  will  awaken even if they wish to remain asleep.  Note  that  this
completely ruins a wizard's or priest's resting, forcing them to begin again.
They  have normal to hit ratios and Armour Class. Sleeping creatures have  no
indication  of  why  they wake up, their unconscious mind just  receives  the
power word and wakes them.
When  the  creatures  are awake, they automatically gain initiative  for  the
round, as well as a +1 to-hit and a bonus -1 Armour Class for that round. Any
creature  performing an action that requires extreme concentration  (such  as
casting a spell, scaling a wall, picking a lock, etc.) mustsave versus  spell
or  automatically  fail the action. Likewise, affected  creatures  attempting
missile  fire must save versus spell. Failure indicates the shot  will  miss,
success means they must roll with a -1 to-hit. The awoke creatures will  know
the  general  location  of  the  wizard, since  they  heard  the  power  word
consciously.
This  spell is not effective within a magical silence, nor will vocalize make
the  spell  castable.  Since this spell does not cause damage,  it  will  not
disrupt an invisibility spell.

This spell sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane. If cast on a
creature  native  to  the  plane it is currently on,  the  spell  sends  that
creature to the outer plane best matching its alignment (yes, it can be  used
on  PCs). If the creature has more Hit Dice or levels than the caster, it  is
not  affected,  even if it wishes so. If the target is already  in  an  outer
plane  that is its home plane, the spell has no effect. There is no  possible
backlash to the caster as in the 7th-level banishment.

      When  this  spell  is cast, the recipient gains a condition  of  sexual
excitement  and productive activity. This is reflected in a +2  modifier  for
every  three  levels of the wizard to Dexterity with respect to  having  sex.
Thus, this spell won't affect any other aspects of Dexterity: only sex.  Also
due  to  his  hyper state, the recipient gains a +1 to-hit. Furthermore,  two
points  of  Intelligence and one point of Wisdom are lost and  one  point  of
Charisma is gained. These bonuses end when the spell ends.

When  this symbol is cast, it will cause a large volume of inorganic material
to  simply vanish and cease to exist as if it had never been. This effect  is
instantaneous, and remains permanent. Only a wish can bring the  lost  matter
back  into  existence. The volume that is destroyed can be in any  shape  the
wizard desires, up to the maximum volume affected.
If  any of the inorganic material is somehow magical, then assign it a  value
of  1  to  6, using the guidelines from the wizard spell detect magic,  where
artifacts  are assigned a value of 6. This is the basic saving  throw  number
that must be rolled, or rolled under, using a 1d20 in order for the object to
save and not be disintegrated.
If  a  magic  item  has  powers  or  bonuses  which  could  protect  it  from
disintegration  then they must be taking into account for  the  items  saving
throw.  An intelligent item cannot be affected by the spell, as it  does  not
count  as an inanimate object. A ring of spell turning would not be  able  to
turn the spell, but the roll is made anyway and if the turning is successful,
then  the  ring  would  get  the  bonus or be saved  completely.  A  ring  of
protection  would  get its saving throw bonus, while a device  of  protection
from disintegration would always save.

The material component of this spell is a pinch of dust from the coffin of  a
mummy.

Casting  of  this  spell  calls  into existence  an  egg  shaped  ball  which
smoulders,  giving  off sparks, and wisps of smoke which  smell  strongly  of
sulphur. The egg appears in the casters hand, and can then be thrown, treated
as  a  grenade-like missile. The egg must be thrown within the round  of  its
creation or it will self detonate. Once thrown, the egg will explode  against
the  first object it hits. A creature directly hit by the egg suffers 1 point
of  fire  damage for every 2 levels of experience of the spellcaster,  and  1
point  of  concussion  damage  for  every  2  levels  of  experience  of  the
spellcaster.  Flammable items directly hit by the egg are scorched,  but  the
fire  is put out by the blast. Those creatures caught in the explosion radius
suffer  1 point of concussion damage for every 2 levels of experience of  the
spellcaster.  A  successful  saving throw versus breath  weapon  reduces  the
damage by half. To summarize, the damage is 1 HP per level for a direct  hit,
1 HP per 2 levels if caught in the blast radius. Save for half damage.
2d6  creatures  within  the  blast radius are  also  affected  (in  order  of
increasing  distance  from the centre) by one of the  effects  on  the  table
below.  To  determine the nature of the effect add the modifiers  appropriate
for  the affected creature, and the effect that matches the total is applied.
Modifiers are as follows:
          Creature saves versus breath weapon: +1
          Creature not directly hit by the egg: +1
          Creature has more than 6 Hit Dice: +1
           Creature  has  more Hit Dice than caster: +1 per 2 Hit  Dice  over
caster
          Creature is larger than size M: +1 per size category over M
          Creature is smaller than size M: -1 per size category under M
Undead are not affected by the blast (except for the damage they take).

     Modifier  Effect
     up to 0   Knocked unconscious for 2d4 rounds
     1    Stunned for one round and deaf for 2d4 rounds
     2-4  Stunned for one round
     4+   No effect

Fragile  items within the blast radius must save versus crushing blow  or  be
shattered  (normal  rules  on  saving  throws  for  items  in  a  character's
possession apply).
Additionally, the egg can be thrown at an object such as a door or  a  chest.
There  is  a  chance of destroying this object, equal to the  chance  that  a
fighter  of  Strength 15 plus the caster's level would have. If the  Strength
value  exceeds 18, then percentile Strength is used (1 category  per  level).
The maximum blast Strength achievable by this spell is 21.

The material component of this spell is a normal, unbroken egg.

This spell can be cast only by a priest of chaotic neutral alignment.
It generates a brilliantly radiant image of the casting priest's holy symbol.
No  matter  from which direction the image is seen, it always appears  to  be
viewed from the front. Creating the image requires a powdered gem of not less
than 25,000 gp value, which is consumed entirely. The colour of the symbol is
orange;  the  intensity is dependent on the priest's strength of faith.  This
colour  is ethereal, wispy, and pale, as if the image were made of  smoke  or
flame.
A  neutral priest cannot affect the undead with this spell, but there  are  a
number  of  general effects that take place. A maximum of  30  HD  of  living
opponents  can  be  affected: lowest first, and a fraction  left  over  still
affects the next creature if at least half of that creature's Hit Dice can be
affected. This affects the living as follows:
      *    Lawful evil or lawful good aligned opponents take immediate damage
at  the rate of 4d6 plus the caster's level every round, and will continue to
do  so until they either leave the area of effect, or the spell expires or is
dispelled. The affected know what is causing the damage unless under charm or
feeblemind or something like that.
      *     Those who are lawful neutral, neutral good or neutral evil  still
take damage, but only when the spell is initially cast: 3d4 plus the caster's
level in damage the first complete round the spell is in effect.
      *     Those  who  are  true neutral, chaotic good or  chaotic  evil  in
alignment take 3d6 damage when the spell is cast.
Additionally,  the caster can choose two of the following additional  effects
to take place:
     *    The caster is given +2 to everything: to-hit, damage, Armour Class,
saving throws, checks, turning, etc. Those with a bow have unerring aim  with
normal  shots,  called  shots get a 0 penalty. Anyone attacking  the  casting
priest while the spell is in effect suffers a  1 to-hit and a +1 Armour Class
penalty.
      *     Any  opponent  with  magic resistance loses  some  of  its  magic
resistance  in  order  to  break this spell. Chaotic  evil  or  chaotic  good
creatures have a penalty of 15%, identical alignments have a penalty  of  5%,
all  others 10%. For example: a lawful evil demon of 25% MR is penalized 15%,
and  is  therefore effectively 10% magic resistant for the breaking  of  this
spell.
      *    Any other spell, or item used to give a spell effect, cast or used
by  the  priest  at this time does maximum effect. Some may  even  be  doubly
effective, as determined by the DM.
      *     No outer planar creature may enter the area of effect unless  its
alignment  matches that of the caster. This spell operates on the astral  and
ethereal  plane, and on the first layer of all the outer planes,  at  reduced
efficiency to be determined by the DM.
      *     An opposing priest of at least 4 levels higher than the caster is
able to dispel another presence in effect, by casting his own version of  the
presence spell.
A  few  notes:  the  spell does take into account that  people  of  differing
alignments may make up the caster's party, and they are counted as allies and
friends  of the caster. On this point, the spell only acts against those  who
were counted as foes by the caster at the moment the casting of the spell  is
complete. Anyone who was in the caster's party is exempt from the spell, even
should they turn on the party while the spell is in effect.
Also,  it may be that the spell will fail those who have been less devout  in
their  practices. Either the spell may not work at all, or it might  backfire
and  affect  those  of  his  own alignment doubly, or  something  like  that.
Increase  the chance of being noticed by the deity to 5% while this spell  is
in  effect   things would have to be pretty serious to cause such a  casting,
or  the  priest is showing off and needs chastisement. The material component
of this spell is the caster's holy symbol.

This spell can be cast only by a priest of true neutral alignment.
It generates a brilliantly radiant image of the casting priest's holy symbol.
No  matter  from which direction the image is seen, it always appears  to  be
viewed from the front. Creating the image requires a powdered gem of not less
than 25,000 gp value, which is consumed entirely. The colour of the symbol is
green  (because the holiness and balanced stability of nature is summoned  in
this  casting),  its intensity dependent on the priest's strength  of  faith.
This  colour is ethereal, wispy, and pale, as if the image were made of smoke
or flame.
A  neutral priest cannot affect the undead with this spell, but there  are  a
number  of  general effects that take place. A maximum of  30  HD  of  living
opponents  can  be  affected: lowest first, and a fraction  left  over  still
affects the next creature if at least half of that creature's Hit Dice can be
affected. This affects the living as follows:
      *     Everyone  of  any  extreme alignment  (those  without  a  neutral
component  in  either  half, diagonal from the true neutral  segment  of  the
alignment chart) takes 3d4 plus the caster's level every round of the spell's
duration. The affected know what is causing the damage unless under charm  or
feeblemind or something like that.
      *    Those that are neither of extreme alignment, nor true neutral take
3d6 damage in the round of casting only.
Additionally,  the caster can choose two of the following additional  effects
to take place:
     *    The caster is given +2 to everything: to-hit, damage, Armour Class,
saving throws, checks, turning, etc. Those with a bow have unerring aim  with
normal  shots,  called  shots get a 0 penalty. Anyone attacking  the  casting
priest while the spell is in effect suffers a  1 to-hit and a +1 Armour Class
penalty.
      *     Any  opponent  with  magic resistance loses  some  of  its  magic
resistance  in order to break this spell. Those of extreme alignment  opposed
have  a penalty of 15%, identical alignments have a penalty of 5%, all others
10%.  For  example: a chaotic good demon of 25% MR is penalized 15%,  and  is
therefore effectively 10% magic resistant for the breaking of this spell.
      *    Any other spell, or item used to give a spell effect, cast or used
by  the  priest  at this time does maximum effect. Some may  even  be  doubly
effective, as determined by the DM.
      *     No outer planar creature may enter the area of effect unless  its
alignment  matches that of the caster. This spell operates on the astral  and

efficiency to be determined by the DM.

This spell can be cast only by a priest of lawful neutral alignment.
It generates a brilliantly radiant image of the casting priest's holy symbol.
No  matter  from which direction the image is seen, it always appears  to  be

and  affect  those  of  his  own alignment doubly, or  something  like  that.
Increase  the chance of being noticed by the deity to 5% while this spell  is
in  effect   things would have to be pretty serious to cause such a  casting,
or  the  priest is showing off and needs chastisement. The material component
of this spell is the caster's holy symbol.

of any non-living, non-magical, non-animate material in its present state for
an  indefinite  duration.  Any  subsequent use of  the  material  immediately
dispels the dweomer. The material component is one fluid dram liquid dust.

This  spell prevents the spoilage of material (mostly food) due to  time.  In
this  aspect  it is similar to the preserve spell of the wizard.  It  has  an
additional  bonus: it changes the aspect of the material so that  pests  like
rats  and  other vermin will not consume or even gnaw on the  material    not
even  if they are very hungry. Thus, it prevents the spoilage of food due  to
vermin.  It  does not prevent spoilage if it is dropped into filth  or  other
ugly  stuff: it still has to be stored in the appropriate containers. It also
prevents magical food from spoiling.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a small  glass
containing jelly which has been sealed after cooking. This glass vanishes  in
the casting.

This spell prevents the successful use of a transmute rock to mud in the area
of  effect,  unless  a  successful dispel magic is cast  first.  The  reverse
totally  negates this spell. The material component is a brick, or  a  sponge
for the reversal.
This  spell  was  researched by Shoogar. Use this  when  building  your  next
castle.  A long study of the attack strategies of high level parties  reveals
the need for this spell.

This  spell  allows  the caster to conjure up an opaque  object  within  some
orifice  of  a  creature  within range, providing  the  creature  with  seven
different sexual stimuli. Any creature with a Constitution of less than 6  or
fewer  than  4  Hit Dice is immediately overcome by the sensation  and  falls
orgasming and unconscious for 2d4 turns. Any attempt to remove the dildo only
lodges  it further, and increases the duration by 2 rounds. The seven colours
of the shimmering cylinder function as follows:

     Colour    Order     Effect    Spell Negated By
     Red  1st  Pornographic   Disbelief, true seeing
               illusions

     Blue 5th  Ben-Wa Rotation     Chill touch
     Indigo    6th  Vibration Irritation
     Violet    7th  Lubrication    Dispel magic

Each  colour must be removed in order to negate the dildo before the  end  of
its  natural duration. The spellcaster also may dispel the dildo at will.  It
is  rumoured  that other variations of prismatic dildo exist, both  in  their
effects and their negations.

This  spell  calls into existence a shard of prismatic energy,  much  like  a
chunk  off  of a prismatic wall. The shard itself is about two feet  long,  4
inches at the base, and a triangular pyramid.
As  protection  from its brilliance, the spell grants the  caster  protection
from its aura by giving him - for lack of a better term - magical arc welding
glasses  (his  eyes turn deep black). All other creatures  must  save  versus
spell or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. Smoked crystal goggles will prevent this.
The caster however is blind at the end of the spell for 1d4 rounds (while his
goggles fade).
This  spell  affects the creature struck just as walking through a  prismatic
sphere:  all  seven  saving throws are rolled as per any  other  prism  spell
(that's  90  points of damage minimum, if they make every saving throw).  The
shard remains to wreak further havoc for its duration.
The verbal component is up to you. The material is a 5,000 gp diamond and the
somatic  component is guiding it with your finger. You do  have  to  maintain
concentration to keep it around (just like spiritual hammer).

This  spell gives some protection against scrying. It uses the magical forces
of  the scrying to trace a path back to the caster and assault them. Upon the
casting of this spell, a force of magical energy is sent back to the scryer.
If  the  scrying  is  being done by an object, it must make  a  saving  throw
against  crushing  blow or be destroyed. If the saving throw  is  made,  that
object's scrying power is locked to the spot (not the object) it is currently
scrying  for 1 turn per level of caster. If the scrying is being  done  by  a
creature (by spell or natural ability), the creature must make a saving throw
versus  spell  or take of 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster  (half
damage if a saving throw is successful). The material component is a mirror.

This  spell  is a more refined version of dispel magic. The spell allows  the
wizard  to  specify  the exact conditions under which it  will  manifest  its
effects, much like a contingency, but without that spell's side effects.
Instructions  may  contain one word per level of the  wizard.  Some  examples
follow:
          "When evil passes, dispel stoneshape".
          "When a century has passed, dispel sepia snake sigil".
          "When box is opened, dispel all magic".
The  spell must be cast on an object or place and can affect all magic within
10  feet.  Magic  cast by other wizards will resist being  dispelled  as  per
dispel magic, unless those wizards collaborate with the wizard in the spell's
preparation.

The  material components are a silver candle snuff, a scroll made  of  vellum
prepared from disenchanter skin and ink prepared from disenchanter blood, and
the  crushed lens from a beholder's central eye. The cost is 100 gp per word,
and the scroll is consumed in the casting. The candle snuff is not destroyed.

With  this  spell, the wizard projects certain sensory effects  onto  another
target,  making it appear that the target is actually the person casting  the
spell  (sensory  effects of spellcasting are discussed in  the  Dragon  Kings
source book, pages 46-52). The wizard must first cast project sensory effects
normally  (note: this spell does not project its own effects when cast,  only
the  effects  of  subsequent  spells, including  subsequent  project  sensory
effects  spells).  Then, for the duratof this spell, the sensory  effects  of
every  spell that he casts have a chance of being projected onto  a  randomly
determined target within the area of effect.
Each  time  the  wizard  casts a spell while project sensory  effects  is  in
effect,  simply count all possible targets within 20 yards of the caster  (do
not  count  the  caster  -  do count the caster's companions  and  any  other
humanoid  within  the area of effect) and roll the closest die  to  determine
which  one  is the target. For example, if there are seven possible  targets,
roll  1d8,  rerolling any rolls resulting in eight. The target is  allowed  a
saving  throw versus spell, including the -1 penalty when this spell is  cast
by  an  illusionist. If he fails, he appears to be the source of the  sensory
effects  that normally emanate from the caster. If he succeeds,  the  sensory
effects appear to originate from the caster, as normal. A wild mage has a 50%
chance  of selecting the target, as long as the target is within the area  of
effect; if the roll is above 50%, determine the target randomly.
The  spell  affects  visual, aural, olfactory, taste,  and  tactile  effects;
"additional"  effects are included at the DM's discretion, but grand  effects
are  never  affected. The somatic concealment proficiency has  no  effect  on
whether  or not a target is perceived as the source of any projected effects;
however,  the  sensory  alteration proficiency can be  used  to  increase  or
decrease  the  intensity of the sensory effects regardless of  the  perceived
source  of  the  effects (see the Dragon Kings source  book,  page  48).  The
material component is a pinch of silt, collected during a silt storm.

This spell creates an adamantine triangle measuring one inch per side in  the
immediate  vicinity  of  the wizard. For as long as the  wizard  is  able  to
maintain   concentration,  the  triangle  is  under  his  complete   control,
accelerating  at the rate of 2 inches per round per round per  level  of  the
caster.  The triangle is half a centimetre thick at the centre and thins  out
to  razor  sharpness at the edges. The wizard guides the path of the triangle
somatically,  and  must make a Dexterity check to hit a  given  object  (with
modifier for size, if any).
The  amount of damage caused varies with the type of motion of the  triangle.
Eg.,  simply passing through an object will cause roughly the same damage  as
an  arrow, whereas repeatedly raking an object can cause up to 1d12 points of
damage per round. More imaginative uses can cause more serious injuries  much
more quickly. If the wizard loses concentration, or something interferes with
the movements of his hands, the triangle will instantly be dispelled, and the
wizard  will take one full round to recover before being able to cast another
spell.

Prosthesis  allows  the caster to fashion a relatively functional  prosthetic
limb. The limb may be as small as a single digit, or it may be any amount  up
to an entire arm or leg.
In order to cast this spell, the wizard must obtain a matching limb (of about
the  same  size and species as the missing limb). While the limb  is  usually
taken  from a dead body, the caster can use the target's own limb  if  it  is
available.  If  the stump has healed (if it is not a fresh  amputation),  the
wizard  must  cut all living flesh from the end of the stump  before  casting
this  spell  - this spell provides no pain relief. After the stump  has  been
prepared,  the  caster touches the prosthetic limb to  the  stump  and  casts
prosthesis. The new limb fuses with the target's skeleton, and he  can  begin
to use it as soon as the casting is finished.
Unfortunately, the target does not regain full function of his limb. The  new
limb, while functional, has no sense of touch and provides only 25% of normal
functioning.  With  each  passing  week,  the  character  gains  another   5%
functionality up to a maximum of 75% of normal. It is up to the DM as to  the
exact  impact  this decreased functionality has on the character  -  examples
included  worsened movement rates, Armour Class, THAC0, reaction adjustments,
etc.  Furthermore, only the bone within the limb is affected by this spell  -
the  remainder  of the limb continues to rot until nothing  remains  but  the
bone. The material component is a bit of glue.
This  spell  can only be used on characters with missing limbs (it  can't  be
used  to give a two-legged character a third leg, for example). The limb  may
be in any state of decomposition as long as the bones are intact.

This  spell  exists in two versions: one ship-bound version and  one  person-
bound version.
The  ship-bound version causes the atmosphere of a ship to be protected  from
the  effects  of external sources of pollution. Thus, it does not  allow  the
atmosphere  of  two ships to mingle that touched each other  with  their  air
envelopes (even if that would be desired). This also causes the phlogiston to
stay  out  of  the area of effect. Thus, it would be possible to light  fires
within  the phlogiston or to cast fire-based spells within the area of effect
without the atmosphere to explode. It is possible to open this shell around a
ship  if the caster desires such an opening. This opening of the shell  takes
one  round per ton of ship to be opened. Thus, it would still be possible  to
exchange  air through the air envelopes. This shell does not offer protection
from  other effects with the exception of gaseous spells that are  cast  from
the  outside of the air envelope of the ship: they are completely negated  if
they  are  cast across the border of the shell. Even if two ships touch  each
other their air envelopes still do not mingle; thus, it would not be possible
to  cast a cloud kill from one ship to the other if the caster is not on  the
other ship, respectively.

The  material component for this version of the spell is a perfect  model  of
the  ship in a 1:1000 size including any rooms to be made. This model is  lit
and  burned within a sealed bottle which contains pure elemental air from the
plane of air. The bottle has to be large enough to contain the unshrunk model
of the ship. The bottle has to be sealed with a single diamond carved into  a
stopper.
The  person-bound  version allows the affected creatures to  enter  any  area
which  contains  either  dangerous gases or no gas at  all  without  negative
effects.  The effects are completely negated even if cast inside  the  sphere
around  each creature. Thus, it protects the creature inside the sphere  from
any  gas  attacks,  even those of an incredibly high wind. The  notes  within
parentheses pertain to this version of the spell.

The  material component for this spell is one hollow, perfectly round  sphere
of blown glass for each creature to be affected.

This  spell is similar to the 4th-level protection from water [2] (q.v.).  It
is  completely alike, save that it offers protection from phenomena that  are
connected  to  acid,  instead of water. Acid is obviously  enough  a  serious
problem. Why no priest ever before developed a spell against it is a  mystery

This  spell  is in all respects similar to protection from lightning  (q.v.),
except  that  it  protects the creature touched against  attacks  using  acid
instead of lightning. The distinction between natural and magical attacks  is
changed  somewhat  however:  "natural"  are  all  acids  made  by  alchemical
procedures;  "magical" are those acids produced by monsters  (black  dragons,
oozes, etc.) or spells.

      This spell is very similar to protection from evil (q.v.) except in its
purpose  and  intent; it keeps out chaotic, as well as summoned or  enchanted
creatures.  It  acts  as  magical  armour on the  recipient;  the  protection
encircles  the  recipient  at  a one foot distance,  thus  preventing  bodily
contact  by creatures of an enchanted or summoned or chaotic nature. Summoned
animals or monsters are similarly hedged from the protected being.

      Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by chaotic creatures incur  a
penalty  of -2 from dice rolls to hit the protected creature, and any  saving
throws  caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected being's  dice.
This  spell can be reversed to become protection from law, although  it  then
still keeps out enchanted or summoned chaotic creatures as well.

      To  complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3 feet diameter circle
upon  the floor or ground with powdered obsidian for protection from law  and
powdered glass for protection from chaos; or in the air using burning incense
or burning dung with respect to law or chaos.

     This spell is basically identical to protection from evil, save that, in
addition  to protecting against summoned and conjured creatures, it  protects
against  all chaotic creatures in the same manner as the other spell protects

by a 5th-level priest, any creature in the area of effect targeted by a charm
spell  would  not need to make a saving throw if 45 or lower  was  rolled  on

When cast, a protection from constriction spell will mitigate crushing damage
taken each round from a single attack form. Up to one hit point per level  of
the priest is deducted from crushing damage. Note that this does not mitigate
damage   from   crushing  weapons  or  falling;  it  will   protect   against
constriction,  bear  hugs,  Bigby's crushing hand,  or  any  similar  gradual
compression.  Example: a 6th-level priest under the effect of this  spell  is
hugged  by an owlbear on three consecutive rounds for 3, 10, and 7 points  of
damage. Damage accrued over each round would be 0, 4, and 1 HP, respectively.

By  means of this spell, the wizard bestows total invulnerability to disease.
The  creature can't contract, become a carrier, or pass on any disease he may
already  have.  This  spell  doesn't cure disease:  it  merely  prevents  its
transfer. When a person is subject to this spell, a glowing light appears  on
the  subject's  palm.  This is to assure the person has this  protection  on.
Therefore,  a  person  can't  untruthfully  say:  "Let's  have  sex,  I  have
protection on". The material component of this spell is a scoop of  mould  (a
generic form of penicillin).

This  spell is similar to the 4th-level protection from water [2] (q.v.).  It
is  completely alike, save that it offers protection from phenomena that  are
connected  to  dust, instead of water. The definition of dust is  very  easy:
think of a lovely big sandy desert and then think of wind and presto: you got
it (come to think of it, it is normally used only in deserts and on the plane
of dust).

The  earth  priest can rend a creature immune to all attacks based on  earth.
The  spell protects against creatures from the elemental plane of earth, from
or  metal weapons or from attacks made using earth (sand, dust, rocks and the
like). The recipient of the spell can breathe normally and does not suffocate
if  buried below ground or in the Sea of Silt. If the priest is 13th-level or
more,  the  recipient can totally ignore the element of earth.  He  can  pass
through  earth  (stone,  metal, rocks, dust, silt, etc.)  and  move  with  no
hindrance at all.
The  material component of the spell is a gem, of at least 1 gp value,  eaten
by  the  recipient during the casting. It vanishes after the  spell  expires.
This  spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary  units
are for the Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

This  spell is equal to the 4th-level priest spell protection from evil,  10-

elementary  sort  (eg., a handful of sand, some water, or even  just  blowing
into  the  air).  For every element supplied while casting,  the  appropriate
elementals will be scared away.

The  recipient of this spell is partially immune to magical forms  of  sleep,
charm, and fear. He automatically receives a saving throw even if one is  not
ordinarily permitted, and if one is permitted, he saves at +4. Note that this
spell will not free the recipient from any enchantment already in force,  nor
will  it  protect him from natural drowsiness or feminine guile, for example.
Also  note that protection extends only to actual charm spells, such as charm
person  or  charm monster, not to enchantment/charm spells as  a  class.  The
material component is a lapis lazuli or more potent stone.

throughout  the  lands - particularly those of the gentry or  nobility.  What
protection  from  housework does is prevent air-borne dust from  settling  on
surfaces  and keep common spores and molds from growing within  the  area  of
effect,  essentially  eliminating the need to perform  everyday  dusting  and
cleaning.  This  spell  does not, however, clean up dirt  and  muck  that  is
accidentally  or  deliberately brought into the area,  thus  it  is  wise  to
prevent  muddy  children or recently returned adventurers into the  protected
area.
The  reverse  of  this spell, continual housework, causes dust  and  dirt  to
accumulate much more rapidly than normal. Normally, within a few hours  after
casting the spell, the area will covered in a fine layer of dust.

The material components for the normal version of this spell is a small clump
of  bird feathers tied together, whereas the reverse requires a bit of an old
cobweb.

ice  storm,  walking  on  harsh and refrozen snow, sliding  down  very  sharp

This  spell  will make the caster immune to the negative effects of  alcohol.
While  protected,  alcoholic drinks will not intoxicate  the  priest  in  the
slightest way, and no side effects of alcohol will be incurred from drinking.
Note  that  this  is really unfair to use in a drinking contest!  Poisons  or
other substances in the drink will still affect the priest normally, however.
Taste is not affected.
The  material  components consumed at casting time are 6  chicken  eggs.  The
other material component is a pink flamingo feather.

The  recipient of a protection from light is granted a total immunity to  all
light,  natural or magical, for the duration of the spell. Light spells  cast
against  anyone protected by this spell will automatically fail. Any creature

This  spell is often used by drow wizards. It is not effective for  creatures
that are actually harmed by sunlight, such as vampires.

This spell totally protects its recipient from all forms of poison except the
most  powerful. The recipient is immune to all poisons except  those  with  a
saving  throw  modifier of -2 or more. Against these poisons,  the  recipient
gains a +8 to the saving throw. Against poisons that do not normally allow  a
saving  throw,  the recipient is allowed a normal, unmodified  saving  throw.
Natural poisons of very powerful creatures (Lolth, powerful fiends, etc.) are
normally not affected by this spell (at the DM's discretion).

     After casting this spell, the wizard will remain dry even if standing in
the  midst  of a torrent. The wizard is protected from splashes  and  falling
drops, but he is not protected from more concentrated bodies such as puddles.
The  water  will simply bead and flow down an invisible field which surrounds
the wizard and his clothing at a distance of about one inch. An oiled leather
rag is the material component of this spell.

      This cantrip protects the target from suffering sunburn even under very

or heat exhaustion. The reverse of the spell, tan, allows the target to get a

but  the  cloudiest days. The material component is a small amount of coconut

This spell duplicates an effect of a helm of brilliance, causing the priest's
holy symbol to glow a bright blue when undead are within 30 yards. All undead
within this area and exposed to the light will take 1d6 points of damage  per
round,  no  saving throw. Any creature under the effects of this pain  cannot
cast  offensive spells. In addition, the priest receives a +1 bonus on a 1d20
roll to turn undead in the area of effect.
The reverse of the spell, protect undead, is cast on a single undead creature
(or  paladin; see rules for evil priests) and will either nullify the effects
of  a  protection  from undead, or move the spell recipient into  one  higher
category for purposes of turning. For example: a lich in spell combat with  a
13th-level  priest  casts protect undead on himself.  He  is  immune  to  the
effects of any protection from undead spell the priest casts, and the  priest
must roll a 19 on a d20 to turn him.
The material component for this spell is a miniature helmet, fashioned from a
clove of garlic. For the reverse, it is a miniature shield, carved from bone.
Both are consumed in the casting.

This  spell is similar to the 4th-level protection from water [2] (q.v.).  It
is  completely alike, save that it offers protection from phenomena that  are
connected  to  vacuum,  instead  of water. This  spell  is  for  those  space
travellers that somehow seem to find themselves floating around in  wildspace
a  little  too  often or those that seem to land in those ugly  vacuum  rooms
which  have absolutely air-tight doors and then increase their size magically
to  very big (still having the same amount of air in a room which is now 1000
feet  per  side  which  was  previously 10  feet  per  side  causes  quite  a
decompression) and for those guys that find themselves rushing up  from  3000
feet  depth in the ocean to the surface of the ocean   normally any  creature
which does this goes pop.

The  water  priest can protect against water, rain, acid and all  water-based
creatures  (elementals for example). The creature is also  protected  against
steam  and can breathe underwater. The protection includes normal and magical
attacks. If the caster is at least thirteenth level, the spell also  acts  as
free action underwater.
The  material  component of the spell is a flask of  water  poured  over  the
recipient. This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This spell is similar to the 3rd-level protection from fire and the 4th-level
protection  from electricity. The effect of this spell depends on the  target
of  the spell. If the spell is targeted on the caster, it protects the caster
from  12  HP per level of damage after the saving throws are rolled.  If  the
spell  is cast on another person, the spell causes a reduction of the  damage
to  one  fourth and grants an additional +4 to the appropriate saving throws.
Elementals of the appropriate type may inflict other damage but their  damage
is still reduced by 2 points per die of damage. In this case, the damage will
not  be  further  reduced by this spell. This spell is  cumulative  with  any
endure,  resist,  or protection spells. The material component  is  the  holy
symbol of the priest.
Protection  from  water is for those that don't fancy to be pounded  by  huge
waves  on the ocean, those that don't like to get wet in the rain (or in  the
sea), those that don't like to be flooded by a transmute dust to water, which
is  normally  quite a killer spell (one cubic yard of water  normally  weighs
nearly one ton), etc.

This  spell protects the recipient from one element chosen when the spell  is
memorised.  The recipient is totally immune to non-magical manifestations  of
the  element,  including  the  environment of  various  elemental  and  para-
elemental  planes. Against magic, the recipient receives a +3 to  the  saving
throw  and takes 50% less damage. This spell is effective against cold, fire,
and  electricity  among other things, but not against  negative  or  positive
energy.  The material component is a bit of the element opposite to  the  one
the  wizard wishes to protect himself from (water against fire, earth against
air, and vice versa).

This  spell  protects  races like locathah, merfolk, etc.  from  the  adverse
effects  of being on the surface. This spell will prevent taking damage  from
drying  out and will allow the recipient to survive just like a normal human.
The  spell  will also enable air breathing for its duration (if needed).  The
recipient  of  protection on surface can only receive its benefits  once  and
then need to wait the length of the spell's duration before they can have  it
cast  upon them again (an example: a locathah has protection on surface  cast
on  it  by an 8th-level priest, allowing the duration to be eight days;  when
the  spell's effects wear off in eight days, the locathah will have  to  wait
another eight days before it can have this spell cast upon it again).
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This  spell  impressively enhances the size, shape, technique,  stamina,  and
eroticism of the affected creature with respect to organs and matters sexual.
Affected  creatures are treated as having a Charisma of  18  by  anyone  they
cruise  or  flirt  with, they become stunningly well endowed,  and  they  are
capable of engaging in extremely hot sex without rest (add a bonus of  1d4  x
caster's level to all sexual rolls).
The  reverse, impotence, makes the subject flirt like a clod, dance  like  an
orc,  and  seduce  like a used chariot salesman. The subject will  experience
appropriate withering, shrinking, and sagging, and will be unable to  achieve
erection  or lubrication. Affected creatures are treated as having a Charisma
of 3 by anyone they cruise or flirt with. Orgasm is either impossible or else
premature and highly unsatisfying.

The material component is a leaf of mint.

Psi-sword is a more powerful form of Graft Weapon. Using it causes
the  sword of the psionicist to bond with him, and the sword takes
on an almost imperceptible glow of psionic power.
      When  used, Psi-sword grants the psionicist a bonus to  hit,
damage,  weapon  speed,  and  AC  equal  to  the  magical   attack
adjustment   of  the  character  from  Wisdom.  Furthermore,   the
psionicist may attack with the THAC0 of a fighter while using  the
Psi-sword.
      A psionicist may not use this power on a sword of average or
lesser quality, unless the sword in question is a weapon forged by
the  psionicist himself.  Even then, the psionicist  will  usually
forge such a weapon of highest quality, as the Psi-sword is a very
personal thing to the psionicist.

Power Score:  The psionicist does double the dice of damage on the
round  of  activation. The psionicist may continue this effect  as
long  as he makes a successful power check each ro and pays double
maintenance  cost.  A second Power Score roll will  not  quadruple
damage, however.

20:   Due  to a psychic backlash, the psionicist drops his weapon,
and is stunned for 1d4 rounds, unable to act, and has an AC of 10.

This  spell  allows the creation of a psionic barrier. No psionics  can  pass
through  the  barrier.  Psionics still function  inside.  The  barrier  stops
psionic scrying, teleportation, dream travel, dimension door, etc. If someone
has  tangents  established, they are broken if they cross the  plane  of  the
barrier.  If  someone  who is contacted crosses the barrier  the  contact  is
broken. Also, someone who is maintaining a power on himself must make  a  new
power  score  check  for each power as he crosses the  barrier  and  pay  the
initial  cost  for each power. If someone is maintaining a power  on  someone
else  the power is "cut off" and contact is broken (if established). In order
to  erect this barrier an inlaid circle of unbroken metal must be used as the
outer edge.

A  blow of brain force forming a wave in all directions around the
psionicist. This blast can jolt a subject's mind like a  piece  of
shocking  news. If one of the targets is a psionicist he  can  get
half  damage  if  he  make his defense mode  (as  against  psionic
blast).  If the defense mode has an area of effect (like tower  of
iron will) all creatures in the area get half damage.
     The maximum damage is half the psionicist level in d6's. Save
vs. Spell (with wisdom bonus) for half damage.
      This  power cannot be magnified by any metapsionic devotion,
the damage limit cannot be increased.

Power Score:  Damage increased to 1d8/8 PSP.

With  psionic  concealment, a psionicist can conceal  his  psionic
activity from those with psionic sense.
      When  the  character makes his check,  all  of  his  psionic
activity is concealed from others.  If a being checks for  psionic
activity,  the   DM  conducts a secret psionic  contest,  and  the
higher  successful roll takes effect.  That is, if  the  concealer
wins,  nothing  is sensed, and if the sensor wins,  he  spots  the
concealment and the powers being concealed.  For the contest,  the
concealment  roll is reduced by one for every five  PSPs  expended
that round.
      Concealment provides reasonably good protection from psionic
feeders and the like, as well as psionicists.

Power Score:  Gain +4 in detection contests.

20:  Lose all psionics for 1d4 turns.

               Mindwipe, 12th level

Psionic Drain is a science that enables psionicists to remove  the
danger of other, beaten psionicists. It enables the user to remove
all   the   sciences  and  devotions  that  the  target  knowingly
possesses.  This removal is permanent, and can't  be  restored  by
anything  less than a Wish spell, or by relearning them  level  by
level.
      This  science can only be used on other psionicists, not  on
wild  talents,  and only on those psionic creatures  with  a  high
intelligence (Dragons and such, DM's discretion).
      An  unexpected feature of this science was discovered by its
creator  after  quite some uses of this power. It enabled  him  to
gain powers that were erased in the others mind.
      This  power can only be used on an unconscious target. After
the  initial contact cost, the psionicist pays 40 PSP's.  Then  he
pays  10  PSP's for each turn that passes. It takes  one  turn  to
erase a devotion, three to erase a science.
      The  chance  that the psionicist is able to  understand  the
power  he  is erasing is 2% for a science, and 4% for a  devotion,
modified  by the level difference of the psionicists involved.  If
the target is of a higher level, the chance increases.
      If the user would gain a power he can't use because of level
requirements (unlikely because he is at least 12th level), he will
not gain the power.

Power  Score:   Devotions take 1/2 a turn to erase,  and  sciences
takes 2 turns.

20:  This power is erased from the psionicists mind.

This science allows the Psionicist to transfer some of his psionic
powers  to  a  non-psionicist (the Psionic version of  a  Priest's
"Imbue   with   Spell  Immunity").  First  the   Psionicist   must
successfully use psychic surgery on the recipient (to prepare  him
for  the  sudden psionic overflow), then he must make a successful
power check for Psionic Transference. Finally the psionicist  must
make a successful power check for each power he wishes to transfer
to  the recipient (note that rolling a 20 or the exact power score
won't  make  a  difference). If the Psionicist  is  successful  he
subtracts 10 PSPs per successfully transferred science, and 5 PSPs
per  successfully  transferred devotion.  For  every  unsuccessful
attempt  to transfer a power the Psionicist subtracts 5  PSPs  per
science  and  2 PSPs per devotion, but he can attempt to  transfer
the power again.
      The psionicist may attempt to as many powers as he want  (as
long  as  he  doesn't  run  out of PSPs),  but  powers  that  need
prerequisites  must be met by the recipient, so  if  a  Psionicist
wanted  to  transfer Psychic Drain the Psionicist  would  have  to
transfer telepathy, contact and the recipient would have to be 6th
level. All powers transferred by the Psionicist can NOT be used by
the Psionicist for until the recipient is slain, the recipient has
used  up his PSPs or 24 hrs have passed... whichever comes  first.
The  psionicist must also lend his PSPs to the recipient  for  the
recipient  to  use  the powers (the PSPs used to  transfer  powers
doesn't  count,  this PSP transfer is for lending  the  Psionicist
PSPs directly to the recipient). For PSP transfer rate is 1:1. The
PSPs transferred to the recipient taken away from the Psionicist's
current and MAXIMUM PSP total. So if the Psionicist has a  max  of
150 PSPs and lends 50 to recipient the Psionicist can have no more
than  100  PSPs. The recipient uses his own con, Int and Wis  when
determining power scores.

Power Score:  Psionicist retains his powers (but not PSPs) with  a
-5 to power score.

20:  The Psionicist passes out for 1d6 turns, the recipient passes
out  for 2d6 turns.

*In  Dark  Sun the Psionicist can transfer powers to  people  with
wild talents but not other Psionicists.

Psychic  Armor is a new defense against unwanted contact. It  puts
the  Psionicist's mind in a kind of armor, weakening  any  psionic
activities.  Thus, it's more difficult to use any  attack  against
the Psionicist, but he himself suffers grievous penalties as well.
Any one other power activated in the same round with this devotion
is penalized with -2 to the Power Score.

Power Score:  The use of this power does not affect other powers.

20:   The  defense falters but the penalty remains for 1d6  rounds
(in addition to any other penalties from this power).

This   power   allows   a psionicist to guide a small  projectile,
such  as  a  knife,  arrow, or sling stone (max weight 2 lbs),  to
its   target.     The   psionicist   must   first    prepare   the
projectile, which takes  two  segments  (see  prep.    time)   and
costs   3   PSP's.   The projectile  may then  be  thrown  (fired,
hurled,  or whatever) normally, but may be guided telekinetically.
The following things are possible at the listed cost in PSP's.
     Add  +1  to  hit,  +1  to  damage, and extend the range by 10
feet  by  spending  2 PSP (cannot spend more than the  psionicists
level) Make a radical  course  correction  (up to 180 degrees)  at
a  cost  of 5 PSP's (all  benefits  bestowed  by previous guidance
are  lost).   Recall the projectile  at a cost of 10  PSP's.   The
projectile will return to the psionicists  hand  (no   DEX   check
required  to catch) from anywhere within  range  (i.e.,   line  of
sight).   The projectile may be made to explode  causing an  extra
d6  damage to the target (or anyone within 3 feet).  This costs  5
PSP's and requires detonate as a prerequisite.
      Prepared   projectiles  may  be maintained at a  cost  of  3
PSP's  per  round.  The maximum number of projectiles a psionicist
may  handle  at  a  time  is one for every 4 levels of experience.
The psionicist must  be able to see the projectile (by some means)
in  order  to guide it.   This  is  not  necessary  for  recalling
the projectile, or for making it explode.

Power Score:  The projectile may be recalled without spending  any
PSP's.

20:  The projectile explodes doing d6 damage to the psionicist.

This  psionic power causes a semi-transparent hand,  made  of  the
user's  psionic life-energy to spring forth from him, and grab  on
to  creatures.  The hand can  be moved anywhere within range in  1
round; then any 'touch' psionic powers can  be used through it.
      The 'hand' exists until it loses it's grip (see below),  the
user  fails to pay maintenance, the hand leaves the range,  or  is
destroyed.   The  hand  is AC0, and has hit points  equal  to  the
psionicist's level. The user actually gives up that  many  of  his
own  HP:  when the power lapses, he gains any remaining  HP  back.
The hand is only hit by magic weapons of effects. Dispel magic and
non-damaging spells have no effect.
      Each  round, the psionicist must check to see  if  the  hand
loses  it's grip if it is being actively avoided.  This  check  is
his  wisdom adjusted by his opponent's AC; either way, maintenance
is paid at this time. All ''reaching'' powers are initiated with -
2 power scores.

Power Score:  Hand has double HP free.

20:  All 'touch' powers are double cost for next turn.

This  power  allow the psionicist to temporarily steal  a  psionic
power  from  another  person.  After contact  is  established  the
psionicist  spend  10 PSP and chooses one of the  victim's  powers
(The  psionicist  must  know if the victim  knows  the  particular
power).

After  that, and while paying maintenance cost, the psionicist  is
able  to  use the power as any other. The victim will  forget  the
power until the psionicist stops paying maintenance.

Power  Score:  The victim is also rendered unconscious  while  the
power is in use.

This science allows a powerful psionicist to transfer a portion of
his  or  her  power to another person when he or  she  dies.   One
science and two devotions are chosen at random from those known by
the  user  of  this power (the Sacrificer), which are  immediately
added to those known by the target.  The target gains enough PSP's
to  use  the  three  powers once per day each, with  4  rounds  of
maintenance.
      If  the  target was a non-psionicist before the use of  this
power,  he  or  she should be treated as a wild  talent.   If  the
target  was  already a wild talent, the new powers and  PSP's  are
added  to  those  currently  possessed.   If  the  target  was   a
psionicist,  the  powers  and PSP's are  added  to  their  current
abilities,  and  are considered separate from the normal  maximums
allowed  by  their  level.  The powers can be  from  a  discipline
outside  those  currently known by the target, and  do  not  count
against  the  maximum number of sciences/devotions per discipline.
If  the  powers granted are already possessed by the  target,  the
PSP's  are  still  gained, and the power score in  that  power  is
increased by one (as though the target had relearned that  power).
In all cases, the PSP and power gain is permanent.
      The  target's alignment becomes that of the sacrificer.   If
this causes the target's alignment to change, this has a 1% chance
per PSP gained of driving the target insane.
     At the discretion of the DM, the target may be visited by the
spirit  of the sacrificer.  The spirit may give the target  hints,
encouragement,   or   other  support  in  particularly   difficult
situations.  This may occur at most once per month, and lasts  for
at most 1 turn.
      To  initiate  this science, the sacrificer must  first  die.
This can be either an accidental or intentional death, although an
intentional  death  for  the sole purpose of  using  this  science
grants  the sacrificer a +2 bonus to his or her power  score.   At
the  very instant of physical death, the player must state his  or
her  intention to initiate Psychic Sacrifice, and also must  state
the target.  The sacrificer's psyche is then kept alive by feeding
off the remaining PSPs the psionicist had at death.  The upkeep of
20  PSPs/round  must  be  paid  each  round  until  the  power  is
successful, or the sacrificer's psyche dies.  The sacrificer  must
also attempt contact (via psionic attack forms if the target is an
unwilling psionicist) each round.  If the sacrificer does not have
enough PSPs remaining to pay the upkeep and attempt contact, their
psyche dies.
      Once contact has been successfully made with the target, the
sacrificer  rolls  against the power score for Psychic  Sacrifice.
The  upkeep  of  20 PSPs must also be paid in this round;  if  not
enough PSPs remain, the sacrificer's psyche dies.  If the roll  is
successful,  the  effects listed above  occur.   If  the  roll  is
failed, contact is broken, and must be attempted again in the next
round.
      If  the Psychic Sacrifice is successful, the sacrificer  may
never  be Raised, Resurrected, or Reincarnated.  However,  if  the
sacrifice  is unsuccessful (the sacrificer runs out  of  PSP's  or
skips  a  round  of  attempting  contact  for  any  reason),   the
sacrificer may be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated.

Power  Score:   the  sacrificer  can  pick  the  science  and  two
devotions granted to the target.

20:   the  sacrfails,  and  both the  sacrificer  and  target  are
psychically stunned, losing all current PSP's (killing the  psyche
of the sacrificer).

1:   only  1 science or 2 devotions (50/50 chance) are granted  to
the target.

Note to the DM:  If this science is allowed in your campaign,  you
should  make allowances for NPC psionicists who have been  targets
of  it in their lifetimes, and therefore have more than the normal
allotment of psionic powers and PSPs.  In particular, the  DM  may
consider  high  level evil NPC psionicists who  "farm"  low  level
psionicists  for  the sole purpose of having them sacrifice  their
powers to their mentor.

With  this devotion, the psionicist is able to create a weak punch
effect,  much  like a weakened Project Force. The attack  is  made
against armor class 10, modified for any magic and dexterity.   If
it  hits,  the  punch does 1-4 points of damage, and disrupts  any
spellcasting.  If the target is moving at any speed  greater  than
that  of  normal combat (roughly 50 feet per round), then  attacks
are  made  with  a -2 penalty. A Protection From Normal  Missiles,
Shield, or Stoneskin spell will be effective against a PK Punch.
      The power can also be used to give objects a "push". This is
nowhere  near as hard as a Project Force, but is more like bumping
into  something. For example, small objects can be moved  quite  a
bit, like keys being knocked off a table or cracking a window, but
large  objects like a door will only have a small bit  of  motion,
like moving a door slightly ajar. Psychokinetic Punch can also  be
used  while  levitating,  to  but a bit  of  force  to  horizontal
movement (up to 30 feet per round).

Power  Score:  Damage is 1-6, or objects are affected by a Project
Force (DM's choice).

20:  The motion is in the opposite direction; attacks always miss,
and objects move in the opposite of the intended direction.

The  psychic  knife  is the physical manifestation  of  Psylocke's
telepathic powers. And with calculating precision she cuts through
the  folds  of  the  target subconscious mind  splaying  open  for
clinical inspection the painful swirl of memories churning  inside
him/her.
     The target hit by the psychic knife suffer effects similar to
ego  wh  The target must save vs. petrification or can do  nothing
(including walking or defend him\herself) for 2d4 rounds.  If  the
save  was  successful the target is dazed for 1d4  rounds,  during
which  all  of his/her die rolls (psionic attacks, melee  attacks,
saving  throws, etc.) are penalized 3 points (or 15%)  and  he/she
cannot  cast  any spells with casting time above 3. Regardless  of
the save a full contact is established with a successful hit
     Optionally the psionicist may try a called shot to the head (-
8),  if successful the victim must save with a -5 penalty. If  the
save  was  successful the target is dazed for 2-8  rounds,  during
which all of his/her die rolls are penalized 5 points (or 50%).
      Tower of iron will and mental barrier can be used to protect
a  psionicist  mind  against the psychic knife.  If  one  of  this
defense modes are active and the victim wins a contest against the
psychic  knife  power score he has a +5 bonus on ST.  and  only  a
tangent  will be established (3 tangents must be made to establish
a  contact).  The  spell  mind blank (8th  level)  can  protect  a
creature  in the same way, the contest will be psychic  knife  vs.
wizard intelligence.
      Other defense modes are useless against this attack but,  of
course, Ejection can destroy the contact.
     Reference: X-Men (Comic)

Power Score:  The knife gain a +2 bonus to hit and the maintenance
cost is halved.

20:   Full cost with no effect. The psionicist is delusioned,  she
thinks  she have a knife but she don't. She will probably  try  to
punch the victim.

      While this spell is in effect, any arrows fired from the bow (which may
not  be a crossbow) are +2 to hit a specific target. The wizard must be  able
to see the target, and call his shot. The +2 only affects hits on the target,
not on someone or something that gets in the way.

     If the target is in melee, the target gets a +2 to it's size rating when
the  DM  determines the odds of hitting the target as opposed to those around
it.  For example, if firing on a size six giant who is in melee with  a  size
two  elf, there would normally be a one in three chance to hit the elf.  With
target bow in effect, the giant would be raised to size eight, giving only  a
one in four chance to hit the elf. Should the arrow go at the elf anyway,  it
would not get its +2 to-hit (since the giant is the target).

      Note that the arrow fired from the target bow is in no way magical. The
material component is a feather from a bird of prey, rubbed against  the  bow
string.

When  this  spell is cast, all normal fires in the area of effect (a  10-yard
per  level  long, 10-yard per level wide, 10-yard high block) are permanently
extinguished. All magical fires in the area of effect or being cast into that
area  within  one  round  have a chance of being extinguished  equal  to  the
priest's percentage chance to successfully cast dispel magic. Any permanently
enchanted fire items (a sword, flame tongue, for example) will have the above
chance of being extinguished for one round. The material component is holy or
unholy water.

While this spell is in effect, the wizard casting it is able to cast any  two
spells  of first through third level (or the same spell twice) which are  not
normally  cumulative, and they will accumulate. Only the effects of  the  two
spells  are  cumulative - duration and range are determined for both  spells,
and  the longer and larger of the two are used. This spell remains in  effect
until  two  such  spells are cast or untione turn passes,  whichever  happens
first.  The  material component is a small flask filled with oil  and  water,
which is shaken vigorously when the spell is cast.

This  is  a  specialized version of the quest spell, usable  by  druids.  The
caster  requires  the subject creature never to harm the natural  environment
and  protect it as best as it can. Every time the subject creature  purposely
harms  the  environment or does nothing to prevent it from harm, he  loses  1
point from his saving throws.
The  caster is always responsible for the use of such powerful magic.  Simply
casting  special  quests to gain an advantage in a casual  battle  may  bring
disfavour upon him, including immediate failure of this spell.
The  spell lasts as long as the caster wills. Like the quest spell, it cannot
be dispelled; it can be removed by a priest of the same religion and of equal
or  higher level than the caster. The material component of the spell is  the
druid's holy symbol.
This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

When  a psionicist learns this power, he develops an understanding
and  affinity for manipulation of the time stream.  The psionicist
learns  to  affect  the relationship betwehis body  and  the  time
stream.   When this devotion is active the psionic slips  slightly
out  of the time stream, allowing his reactions to be quicker than
those around him. This gives him a +2 on initiative in every round
that  this  discipline is active.  Furthermore any  saving  throws
which  would normally allow a bonus for higher dexterity are  also
made at +2.
     This discipline cannot be used in conjunction with magic that
affects  time  stream  (haste, slow, potion of  speed,  etc.).  If
already  under the influence of one of these types  of  magic  the
psionicist  will  be  totally unable to  activate  this  devotion.
Conversely, when this discipline is under affect the psionicist is
immune to the effects of these magics.

Power Score:  The aforementioned bonuses improve to +3.

20:   The  power fails, and double the initial cost  in  PSP's  is
consumed.

This  spell  allows  one  creature to be able to run at  full  speed  without
getting  tired  over stone, dirt, or grass. At the end of the  duration,  the
creature must stop for 1 turn for each hour it was running. During this  time
it can do nothing except drink liquids and eat small, light portions of food.
At  the  end of this resting period, the creature will start to regain enough
energy  to be able to carry on normal activities (eat, walk, etc.). When  the
creature has stopped for a time equal to the time it ran, it will be able  to
carry  on all activities without penalty (fight, run, etc.). This spell  will
work on horses, pack animals, etc. The material component for this spell is a
small piece of leather.

This  is  basically one of those piss-off-the-fighter-subclass  spells.  What
happens is that, suddenly, at the moment of casting, the wizard is capable of
casting  half  his level of spell levels. Because of the difficulty  of  this
spell, the wizard must save versus spell or blow it big time. All spells cast
with  quicksilver are thus subject to special failure. DM's imagination or  a
nice  spell failure table are required. The material component for this spell
is a drop of mercury.

When  this  spell  is  cast,  light, that appears  as  a  chromatic  mass  of
intertwined rays bundled together in the shape of a spear, appears above  the
wizards  head.  The  wizard goes through the motion of  throwing  the  spear,
without ever touching it, while speaking the name and race of the creature to
be  slain. The spear then flies towards its target and will kill the creature
instantly  if a saving throw versus death magic is failed. The slaying  spear
never misses.
If  the saving throw is successful, the spear misses the creature's brain  or
central  nervous  system, and instead hits another part of the  body  causing
10d8  HP + 1 HP per level of the wizard damage. The surge of energy into  the
creature will also stun it for 2d4 rounds.
For  the  spell  to work to its fullest potential, certain things  should  be
known about the target: race, anatomy, true name (if applicable), and general
background  and history of the creature. If any of these are  known  (or  not
known) then the creature's saving throw is modified as follows:

          Information    Information
     Information    Known     Unknown
     race -1   +2
     anatomy   -1 to -4  +3
     true name -4   +2
     background     -1 to -5  +3

The  total  saving  throw  modifier because of knowledge  of  the  creature's
anatomy depends on how much the wizard has studied the creature's species. As
a  general guide, it would take about one month of study, along with lots  of
specimens, to be completely familiar with a certain species' anatomy.
The  saving  throw modifier because of knowledge of the creature's background
depends  on  how  much  and how deeply this specific creature's  history  and
current life have been researched.

The  material component for this spell is a copper spearhead and a  glass  or
crystal  prism. If the creature was killed because of a failed saving  throw,
then  the spearhead will be found in the brain. If the saving throw was made,
then the spearhead will be found in a random part of the body.
There  is an additional -2 modifier to the saving throw if, for some  obscure
reason,  the  creature  is  re-subject to this spell  with  the  same  copper
spearhead that was used the first time (the spearhead has learned where to go
this time).
The prism disappears after the spell is cast.

At  the  completion of casting, a magical short bow is created in  the  spell
caster's  hand. This bow allows the wizard to use it as if he were a  fighter
of  the  same level, proficient in the short bow. The wizard also  gains  any
missile attack adjustments for Dexterity. The bow itself has a +1 to-hit.  It
damage varies on the amount that you pull the string back. Maximum damage  is
equal to 1d6 per level. Different combinations of arrows can be created.  Two
arrows per round can be fired, as long as the maximum damage has not yet been
met.
For  example, if the caster is of eighth level, he can fire eight 1d6  arrows
over  the  course of 4 rounds minimum, a single 8d6 arrow, or any combination
between  the  two.  The bow remains in the caster's hand  until  all  of  the
magical  energy  is  used up, to a maximum of 1 round per  level,  until  the
caster  decides  to cast another spell, or until the caster  is  hit  with  a
successful  dispel magic. At the completion of the spell, the  bow  vanishes.
The range of the bow is 5/10/15.

The  material  component for the bow is a miniature gold short bow  of  great
artistry  worth  at least 1,000 gp. For every 1d6 of damage  fired  from  the
deathbow,  the material component drops in value by 5 gp. Note that  this  is
fired  damage,  not  potential damage. If the caster can fire  8d6  worth  of
arrows, but chooses to use only 4d6, the gold bow's value decreases by 20 gp.

This spell can only be used in conjunction with armour: the armour spell must
be cast first and this should immediately be followed by casting this spell.
Quiz's interposing shield performs in much the same way as armour. It  is  an
invisible barrier the size of a medium shield. The barrier acts as  a  medium
shield and lowers the caster's Armour Class by 1 in regard to attacks that it
can  impose itself upon. The caster does not need to concentrate in order  to
use the shield.
The shield adds one point to the amount of damage that armour can take before
being  dispelled. When the armour has been dispelled, the shield vanishes  as
well.

The  material component for the spell is a medium sized metal shield.  It  is
consumed in the casting.
This  magic  was  developed by Quiz, practitioner of  the  art  of  illusion.
"Rumour  has  it that I often found myself too encumbered in  combat  to  use
anything other than party members for my shields. This did not fare well with
certain people, so I created this spell".

When  this spell is cast, the wizard creates the illusion of one of the  most
fearsome things imaginable to the victim, simply by forming the fears of  the
victim's  subconscious  mind  into something  that  his  conscious  mind  can
visualize.  In  this  case, the fear is that the victim can  no  longer  cast
spells.
The only defense against Quiz's nullifying magic is an attempt to disbelieve,
which can be tried as many times as desired. To disbelieve the phantasm,  the
subject must specifically state that he is making the attempt and then roll a
saving throw versus spell. For each attempt of a saving throw after the first
there  is  a  -1 to the roll. For example, attempting a fourth  saving  throw
would have a -3 penalty to the dice roll.

This  spell allows a caster to store a burst of energy in a crystal worth  50
gp,  the material component of this spell. This crystal is consumed only upon
use  of  the  spell.  The caster must keep it with him  until  the  spell  is
activated.
When  activated, the caster can increase his movement rate by 6 for up  to  1
round  per  level.  This spell must be used upon starting movement  or  while
moving.  Premature  destruction of the crystal results in  an  uncontrollable
burst  of  speed.  The  caster must make a Dexterity check  at  -4  to  avoid
tripping.  Those who trip are assumed to have moved a random  distance  (DM's
discretion) and then fallen. They are then stunned for the rest of the round.
Note that any caster can only have one crystal at any given time.
This spell was created by Quiz, practitioner of the art of illusion. "Being a
short-legged gnome, I found it quite necessary to find a method  to  overcome
my reduced running speed. One who runs today fights another day!".

      The  psionicist  using this power gains  a  picture  of  his
surroundings  by analyzing the echoes created when sound  rebounds
off  objects.  There  must be  some sound for  the  psionicist  to
"see",  and  the picture he sees is colorless and  quite  hazy.  A
psionicist  who  uses the create sound psychokinetic  devotion  to
create  high  pitched clicks at short intervals can  see  a  sharp
picture.
      Radar  sense allows the psionicist to "see" even in complete
darkness. even magical darkness won't affect this power. Invisible
objects can be seen just as easily as other objects, and illusions
are  transparent  (or semi-transparent if shadow magic  is  used).
Small  details, as well as painted patterns, pictures or  writings
cannot  be  seen by using radar sense. Magical silence will  cause
the  psionicist  to see only blackness. Thus a magically  silenced
person will look like a large black sphere.
      The  psionicist  using radar sense has the black  and  white
picture  superimposed on what his eyes see. This is often  exactly
what he wants, as it simply enhances his visual perception.

Power  Score:   The psionicist gains all round "vision"  with  the
radar sense.

20:   For  1d4  turns, loud sounds cause temporary blindness,  and

This  spell allows the priest to call aid to herself. When the spell is  cast
upon a willing creature a condition is set (usually a command word) that will
instantly  transport  the  creature to the priest  (also  known  as  word  of
recall). The priest may choose the creature's arrival point as long as it  is
within  the  priest's  line  of  sight. Note: Creatures  not  willing  to  be
transported  may save versus death magic to resist the calling. The  material
component for this spell is a cymbal.

This  spell  launches  a bolt of killing energy specifically  tuned  to  slay
dragons. Any dragon struck by this spell must save versus death magic or die.
If  the saving throw succeeded, it suffers 1d10 HP of damage per level of the
wizard.  Against any other creature, the spell inflicts 1d6 per  level,  save
for  half  damage. The material component is the tooth of a wyrm  or  greater
dragon slain by the wizard without using this spell.

      This  risky spell draws upon the chaos of magic to form magical  energy
into  a  spell of more power than the wild mage could otherwise  be  casting.
Random  spell,  when  casts, creates an effect equal to a  randomly  selected
spell  of second or third level. The wizard does not know what spell will  be
duplicated:  that  is determined the instant the spell is cast.  The  casting
time  of  the  second spell is one round, and it must be cast  in  the  round
following the casting of random spell.

      In that instant, the wizard learns the basics of how the spell is to be
targeted. The wizard might know to select a single target, a centre point for
an  area  effect spell, an object, a direction (for a cone or similar spell),
or whatever. If there is no suitable target within range, random spell fails.
If  appropriate, the duration is also determined this way. The wizard  learns
nothing else, including whether or not the spell is harmful or helpful.

      Random spell should be rolled off of a fairly large list of spells that
includes  both  common  and unusual spells. The lists  in  the  back  of  the
Forgotten Realms book would work quite well, but any other list will do.  DMs
should  not include spells with a normal casting time of one turn or more  in
this list.

The  contingency  trigger  functions identically  to  the  3rd-level  Rathe's
trigger, with one exception: a condition may be applied to the triggering  of
the  spell  (for  instance, "trigger only if a man wearing green  enters  the
area",  or "trigger if anything made of gold enters the area"). Note  however
that  the spell's "perception" is restricted to the area of effect. The spell
cannot  perceive intangibles such as class, level, or alignment. The material
component is as Rathe's trigger, but must be worth twice as much.

The  mage lock is an advanced form of wizard lock. There are two main changes
from  the  latter. First, while the spell is in effect, the portal cannot  be
damaged  or  destroyed  by  any physical (not  magical)  means  short  of  an
elemental. Note, however, the magical means of destroying the door (fireball,
disintegrate,  etc.) still work normally, and if the door is  destroyed,  the
spell is broken. If the spell is dispelled or negated by any means whatsoever
(even temporarily), the portal will crumble into dust.
Second,  the spell has another application; it can be placed upon an  object.
The  effect of this is to allow anyone wearing or carrying the object to open
any mage locks by the same wizard. For example, if one of Rathe's mage locked
bracewas  worn, the wearer could open any door mage locked by Rathe (but  not
by  any other wizard). The material component is half a pound of iron filings
for the first application and 100 gp worth of diamond dust for the second.

The  trigger  spell is designed as a defensive spell. When it  is  cast,  the
wizard  defines  a  volume  which must be at  least  half  a  foot  in  every
dimension.  This area begins to glow faintly. The wizard then  casts  another
spell  directly upon the trigger's area of effect. It must be  touchedby  the
wizard  when  applying  the second spell. The glow then  vanishes,  but  both
spells  remain. The second spell is held by trigger until someone  enters  or
touches  the spell's area of effect. At this time, the second spell  will  go
off.
If  it  is  an area effect spell (fireball or web, for example)  it  will  be
centred  on  the  centre  of  the  trigger area.  Other  considerations  (the
dimensions of the web, for instance) must be specified at the time of casting
the  second spell. Person-affecting spells (hold person or charm person,  for
example)  will  be applied to the person who triggered the  spell.  A  saving
throw is applicable only if allowed by the second spell. If the wizard is  in
or touching the trigger's area of effect, it will not go off. This allows the
wizard to escort others safely through the trapped area.
One  possible use for this spell is two triggers overlaid in a corridor,  one
with a fireball, and the other, placed slightly behind the first, with a wall
of  force.  If  a  person enters the regions from the  wrong  direction,  the
fireball will go off, and the wall of force will instantly restrict the blast
to  one  direction. If a person enters the regions from the other  direction,
the  wall  will trigger first and shield him from the blast. The spells  will
last until triggered, but if the second spell is not applied immediately, the
trigger  will  only  last  one turn per level of  the  wizard.  The  material
component  is  a black pearl of not less than 500 gp value per level  of  the
second spell.

By  means of this spell, the priest brings about a transformation of the  air
about himself, compressing large volumes of it into a minute area and sending
it  at  a target. Though this wind has no actual edge, it is highly effective
when  it  strikes its target, causing 1d8 points of damage per level  of  the
priest.  In  addition, the victim of the razorwind must make a  saving  throw
versus  rod, staff or wand, or an extremity will be severed (as with  a  blow
from a sword of sharpness). This saving throw is modified by +1 for each plus
of  magical  armour the target is wearing (only armour: not  shields,  rings,
bracers, etc.). In addition, persons wearing plate mail or better receive  an
extra +1 on the saving roll.
Because  such  a large volume of air is needed to create the razorwind,  this
spell  can  only be cast outdoors or in a chamber of vast size (at  the  DM's
discretion). If it is cast in a smaller, more confined area (eg., indoors  or
underground  passage), it will not function and everyone  in  the  area  will
suffer a momentary loss of air.
The  material components for this spell are the holy symbol of the priest,  a
bloodstone, and a small, flat piece of steel.

When  this  spell  is cast, every wizard in the area of effect  has  to  save
versus  spell. Those who fail have a big glowing, flashing, neon sign  saying
"I'm a wizard, hit me!" and an arrow pointing at them pop up.
A  normal wizard has a sign that changes colours, but a specialist has one of
a specific colour. The colours are:

     Specialist Type     Colour
     Abjurer   Purple
     Conjurer  Green
     Diviner   Yellow
     Enchanter Violet
     Illusionist    Blue
     Invoker   Red
     Necromancer    Black
     Transmuter     Orange

The  sign of an elementalist is surrounded by his element. The sign of a wild
mage  is most spectacular. It has light bulbs of all colours flashing  around
it.  It  turns  around, spinning on its axis as it shrinks  and  enlarges  at
random and bobs up and down.
The  spell  was first cast by Raztak at a wizard academy, with a  spectacular
result: his tutor almost strangled him for it.

By  means  of  this  spell, the wizard can read knowledge or  memory  of  the
victim.  Only  conscious knowledge and memory can be read, i.e.,  forget  can
hide  information from this spell, while remember can recall information  for
this  spell. The victim may be conscious or unconscious. A successful  to-hit
roll must be made on unwilling victims, which, if conscious, also get to make
a  saving  throw. Time required depends on the information that is  required,
but is typically the time it would take to relate the information wanted.
The  reverse of this spell, mind shield (abjuration), protects the  recipient
from the effects of read mind for 1 day per level of the wizard.

      This  power allows a psionicist looking at a portrait  or  a
sculpture  of a person to find information about that  person.  It
can  reveal his class or title, his alignment, age, and  even  his
current  whereabouts. The amount of information gained depends  on
the result of the power check. If the psionicist's power check  is
successful,  he  learns the information listed beside  that  check
result  on the table below, plus all the information listed  above
it.

Result    Information Gained
     1    Race & Sex
     2    Age at time of painting
     3    Current age

     10   Current location - within 10 miles
     11   Current location - within 1 mile
     12+  Current location - Exact
      *  Current location gives the whereabouts of the person,  or
the  place of his body (if dead). Global location is a country  if
the  person is on the same continent as the psionicist,  continent
if  on  the same planet, and planet if in the same crystal sphere.
If the person in the portrait is outside the crystal sphere, or on
another plane, the psionicist cannot find his location, but senses
that he is not in this world.
      A  psionicist can use the power again, but he will not  gain
more information by doing so, unless he advances a level. A use of
the  power  will reveal things which have been modified,  however,
such  as  the  age, level or alignment. It will also  give  a  new
current  location in case the person has moved, or the  psionicist
is close enough to get a better global location.

Power  Score:  The psionicist gains all the above information,  as
well  as a 5 second vision of the person's current location (which
is enough for him to teleport there).

20:  If the person is alive (or undead), he senses that someone is
in  possession  of  the  portrait, and gains  the  global  current
location of the psionicist.

This  spell  is  similar  to the standard fly spell. However,  it  gives  the
recipient air manoeuvrability class A. It also allows the recipient to travel
at speeds up to 50. The recipient of this spell can carry up to two times his
body  weight without losing manoeuvrability. For each additional multiple  of
bodyweight  carried (three times, four times, and so on), the manoeuvrability
class  will  be reduced by one. The spell can move at most one fifth  ton  at
only  hover  level. The material component of this spell is  a  wing  of  any
flying creature.

This  spell  temporarily  resurrects an item that was  shattered,  burnt,  or
disintegrated,  so that the forensic wizard may study it. He must  gather  as
much of the debris as possible, for otherwise the object can be but partially
reassembled, in which case it may be illegible or unidentifiable. The  object
will  be very fragile, but it may be the subject of various divination spells
such as identify or reveal owner. The material component is a drop of honey.

This spell is similar to the 4th-level spell Rednog's plant transfer with the
exception  that an animal feature is gained. This feature can  be  one  thing
that  is specific for the animal. Thus, a character could gain the bears claw
and  hug  attacks, or a snakes poisonous bite, or a monkeys climbing  ability
(including  long, hairy arms and a grasping tail), etc. Again,  this  ability
has to be adjudicated by the DM. As with the previous spell, if the character
uses  his  special ability to attack, these attacks use up all other  actions
the  character has unless he has trained for almost excessive times  in  this
new  form.  This  spell cannot be used multiple times on the same  characters
while they still have one ability from one animal. The first spell has to run
its course or it has to be dispelled before another ability can be gained.
The  material components are a part of the animal of which the characters are
to get a feature of plus the priest's holy symbol.

This  spell is similar to the two spells plant transfer and animal  transfer.
It  gives the recipients one ability of an elemental of the priest's  choice.
This can be the movement type (and speed), the attack type (and damage),  the
immunity  (and  vulnerabilities) of a single elemental, etc. Thus,  it  could
enable the characters to walk through the earth like an earth elemental  (but
does  not  give  them  the  ability so see, hear or  breathe  like  an  earth
elemental), or it could allow the characters to walk through a fire  if  they
had  gained the invulnerability of a fire elemental (but note that they would
take  double  damage from water or ice magic for the time), etc.  Thus,  this
spell  is  a  rather  mixed blessing. The spell cannot be  ended  prematurely
except with the use of a dispel magic spell.
Like  the other spells of this kind it is not possible to gain more than  one
ability with the use of this spell   even if the spell is repeated.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a little  part
of  the  element that the characters want to get an ability from (a flame,  a
drop  of  water, a breath of air, or a stone). If the abilities of quasi-  or
para-elementals are wanted, double the casting time and have a small piece of
the respective quasi- or para-element at hand.

With this spell it is possible to positively identify functions, keywords and
even  curses  on  items  -  even those items where the  curses  are  normally
undetectable.  Note  that curses are detected first. This  spell  forces  the
wizard  to  save  once per try to identify one of the above. If  failed,  the
wizard  loses  one  hit point permanently and the item  has  to  save  versus
disintegration. If this saving throw fails as well, it explodes in  a  circle
of  raw magical energy with the force of a 10d6 fireball in a 20-foot radius.
There  is no saving throw nor will magic resistance help to reduce the effect
- not even a scarab of protection will work. If the wizard succeeds, he first
determines  the curses, then the weakest to the most powerful  functions  and
then the key and trigger words for the functions (again, from the weakest  to
the  most  powerful). If he fails to save but the item is not  disintegrated,
but  he  cannot try to identify that specific function in that specific  item
again until he has earned a new level. The wizard has up to one try per round
to  determines abilities. He can try to identify several different items.  He
cannot  move around after casting this spell, so he has to have all items  to
be  identified within easy reach of him (as they have to be within 1 foot  of
him when he casts the spell). Note that they do not have to be touched, so no
bad  effects happen to the character unless the item explodes. Note also that
artifacts cannot be destroyed with this spell: the character is only  shifted
to  the  creator  or to an outer plane if he tries that (note  that  on  some
planes, like Ravenloft, this does not work).
The  reversed  version  of  this  spell,  hide,  causes  any  kind  of  magic
identification  or  even of normal kind (such as bardic  knowledge)  to  fail
utterly. The material component is a complete and unbroken eggshell in  which
the yolk has been replaced with a 1000 gp diamond.

This spell allows the caster to apply a "layering" effect to spells which are
normally  not cumulative with each other. It does not matter if these  spells
are  wizard or priest spells. All spells which are to be layered have  to  be
cast  in  immediate succession beginning the next round after finishing  this
spell.  Once this casting has stopped, no additional spells may be  added  to
the  layering effect. Thus, it would be possible to layer several  stoneskins
over each other; to create a multiple haste effect, etc. This spell allows  a
maximum stacking effect of one additional spell per 3 caster levels to be  in
effect on one creature (it would be possible for a 21st-level caster to allow
a  stacking effect of three additional hastes, one stoneskin, protection from
fire,  protection  from  lightning, and a prayer spell  on  one  creature  in
addition  to already existing versions of these spells on the same creature).
It  is  not possible to cast this spell on a creature which already has  this
spell  in  effect. Thus, this is the only spell which may not be  layered  or
stacked with itself. The duration of this spell is the duration for a  single
additional 1st-level spell. It is reduced for every additional level of  each
additional  spell by one day; once one day or less is left, it is reduced  by
one  hour in the same ratio, until one hour or less is left. Now decrease  by
turns  until  one turn is left, then decrease by rounds to a minimum  of  one
round.  Thus,  our 21st-level wizard, who would stack seven 9th-level  spells
(one  spell  of 8 levels higher than first level plus 6 spells  of  9  levels
higher  than a 1st-level spell would make 62 units) on himself would  have  a
duration of 10« days for a single 1st-level spell; it would first be  reduced
by  10  days (leaving 52 units and « day, or 12 hours duration), then  by  11
hours  (leaving  41 units and 1 hour duration left over),  then  by  5  turns
(leaving  36  units  and  10 rounds), then by 9 rounds  to  1  round  minimum
(actually leaving 27 units) and only a single round of duration. Thus, it  is
not  very  good  to layer too many high level spells as they run  out  almost
immediately.  Once the duration of this spell runs out (or it is  dispelled),
all  layered spells end immediately. This spell may also be applied to spell-
like effects.
Note:  the  layering  effect  is only additive: thus,  6  hastes  don't  give
2x2x2x2x2x2 = 64 times all attacks but only give a multiplication  factor  of
12.
This spell has a significant negative side effect: as layering causes such  a
concentration  of  magic, it causes all boundaries of  magical  items  to  be
significantly  weakened.  It  is  therefore possible  that  magic  items  and
permanent spells are permanently destroyed in a most violent fashion. In case
of  a permanent spell, the chance that this happens is a base 100% minus  10%
per  spell  level of the permanent spell. In case of an item, the  chance  is
100%  minus  10% per spell level of the highest powered effect of  the  item,
similar to any existing spell or minus 15% per plus, in case of an item  with
plusses  (whichever is the higher of the two modifiers).  Next,  add  1%  per
spell level layered on the creature.
If  a  spell or an item is destroyed by this spell, the magic contained  will
not  pass  away quietly. It causes an explosion of spellfire doing  1d10  hit
points  of damage per contained charge or per spell level which was destroyed
in  a  1-foot per charge or spell level destroyed radius sphere. As  this  is
spellfire,  only a wall of force will prevent others from taking  damage  (no
other  resistance helps: not even magic resistance or immunity to fire);  the
target  creature takes full damage no matter what resistance it normally  has
(as it cannot encase itself with a wall of force).

The material component is a block of mithril which is made up from two layers
of  mithril for each spell level to be layered and a single scroll  for  each
spell which is to be layered. Each scroll has to be completely encased  in  a
thin  coat  of mithril. This block then has to be speared with an  adamantine
spike  which  was  broken on an anvil and then fixed again with  one  mending
spell  per spell level to be contained in the block. The whole mithril  block
without  the  scrolls costs no less than 3000 gp per spell  level  it  is  to
contain  (thus,  our  21st-level wizard above would  have  wasted  7  scrolls
containing  a  single 9th-level spell each and a full 7x9x3000 gp  =  189,000
gp).

This spell is a more highly powered detect magic. It allows a wizard to trace
magic even if the magic only passed through the area of effect - even if this
happened  quite some time ago: up to one hour in the past per  level  of  the
caster.  It  collects  the  impact of magic on the time-space  continuum  and
amplifies  it  for  the  wizard to be able to identify  different  traces  of
different items - up to two different item or spell effects per level of  the
caster.  It  detects  the  different strengths,  numbers,  schools,  time  of
creation  (up to 1 hour exact) and source and name (wizard, priest,  natural)
of  the magic (spell or item). Note that it does not identify psionics.  This
spell is able to detect invisible objects or creatures.

The material component is any kind of permanent magic item: even a stone with
a  continual light or magic mouth spell on it is enough for this spell. If an
artifacts  is used for this purpose, it is not destroyed but sent to  another
plane (preferably where it can be used against the characters).

This spell causes one person per five levels of the priest to gain the powers
of a single plant the priest has a small part of. Thus, a character could get
the effects of oak bark (increase his Armour Class by 4 points, gain a +2  on
all  saving  throws except versus fire), or underwater algae (thus conferring
upon  the character the ability to breath water), etc. This effect has to  be
adjudicated  by  the  DM. Some plants are, for example, extremely  poisonous.
Thus,  characters could become highly deadly to creatures that tried to  bite
or  even eat them. The transfer is almost always coupled with a negative side
effect  (like green skin, an incredible stink, or something like that).  This
side effect is never something positive unless the characters can find a  way
to  make  green  skin  be a positive asset. If the victim  is  unwilling,  it
receives  a saving throw versus spell against the spell; if it succeeds  they
repel  the complete effect   not only the negative side effect. The character
can  act normally unless he uses his special ability to attack   this  attack
takes  up  all  other  actions of that round as it can be  assumed  that  the
character is not familiar with the ability. The spell cannot be used to  give
the same characters more than one ability from a plant at once   not even  if
the spell is cast again during the duration of the first spell.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest and a part of  the
plant that is to transfer one of its features to the characters.

This  spell  is  for those of you who dislike it when you  don't  get  enough
bonuses together to make your saving throw. This spell provides you with  one
+1  bonus for every 3 caster levels which you may apply after you have failed
a  saving throw. These bonuses can be stored until they have been used up  in
saving throws. The caster can choose when to use these bonuses. If he chooses
to  use  them  he  needs to use as many as he would need to push  his  failed
saving  throw  roll to his base saving throw as if he had no  other  bonuses,
including race, specialism, or any other bonuses. These bonuses can  be  used
to make even a failed saving throw with a roll of 1 a succeeded saving throw,
but  you  need three times as many bonuses to bring it up to the base  saving
throw  as  explained above. Examples: a 16th-level wizard with a base  saving
throw  of 7 versus dragon breath fails his saving throw against our favourite
red  dragon with a roll of 4 (and he has only a ring of protection,  +2),  he
can  choose to push up his rolled number of 4 to the number 7 by using  3  of
his  bonuses (of a maximum of 5 bonus points). If a 19th-level wizard with  a
base   saving  throw  of  3  versus  spell  fails  his  saving  throw  versus
disintegration  by rolling a 1, he could choose touse up  his  maximum  of  6
bonus  points to succeed with his saving throw (which he probably does).  The
spell  lasts  until all bonuses have been used up. This spell  is  cumulative
with itself up to a maximum bonus of one plus per level of the caster.
The  reversed  form, Rednog's protection decreaser, needs a  to-hit  roll  in
combat.  The  person  to be affected gains a saving throw  versus  spell.  If
succeeded,  nothing  happens. If failed, the person has the  same  number  of
negative  modifiers as above. These modifiers are to be applied to  the  next
life-and-death saving throws. If possible, these modifiers will try  to  push
the  saving throw to a failed result. Only the necessary number to cause  the
next  saving  throw to fail will be needed. For example, a 19th-level  wizard
casts  this  spell and hits an opponent with it. The opponent,  an  8th-level
fighter,  fails his first saving throw. A short while after this  fight,  the
fighter again has to save versus spell. He normally has a saving throw  of  5
versus spell, with all bonuses he has acquired per magic protective items. He
rolls a 7 and is really happy to have made his saving throw, but suddenly the
reverse kicks in: a 19th-level wizard causes a full 6x-1 points to be applied
to the next saving throws of our fighter. Now we deduct three of those points
to  reduce  the roll to a 4 and cause the saving throw to fail. The  reversed
spell  is  still  in effect with only another -3 points for the  next  saving
throw(s).

The material component is a solid, perfect sphere of hizagkuur metal (see the
Dwarves  Deep book), encased in a perfect ball of adamantine, which is  again
encased  in  a  perfect sphere of mahogany wood. The ball of hizagkuur  metal
stays  intact and can be reused after the casting, but the two outer  casings
vanish.  Any  wizard  can own a maximum of one of these hizagkuur  balls  for
every  level at once. After each casting they need a full month of reattuning
time to attune to the character as the casting destroys this careful balance.
The  two outer casings have to be without seams or hinges. Thus, it is not  a
material component to be had in generous amounts.

The  material component is the same sphere only in the reversed order and  an
additional cover of greased paper to prevent damage from the hizagkuur metal.
The wizard can have as many of these reversed spheres as he can afford.

This  spell backs up a single selected skill of a creature. Skills which  may
be  backed up are THAC0, levels, spell levels, proficiencies, ability scores,
etc.  This  one backup skill does not allow the creature to use it  twice  as
good  or  twice  as often, but it just exists as a silent backup  inside  the
creature.  Thus, if the original skill is lost (due to whatever  cause),  the
backup will fill the blank. This backup is at the level of ability as it  was
at  the day the spell was cast. The skill is a little less powerful than  the
original  (as  it  is  just a backup). Thus, any backup  ability  scores  are
reduced  by  one, any spell levels will have one less spell  per  level,  the
levels will be reduced by one, Hit Dice will be reduced by one hit point each
(note: not one hit point per level but one hit point per Hit Die), etc. Thus,
while  it is possible to back up all mental and physical abilities, they  are
seriously  reduced. The character then also functions only at these abilities
(if a 20th-level wizard with 18 Intelligence is doubled and his double has to
kick  in,  he  is  not able to cast 9th-level spells as  he  requires  an  18
Intelligence for that - and now he only has a 17, so tough luck). The doubled
skill  does  not include memorised spells. Thus, while a wizard may  back  up
spell  levels, the spells in these spell levels will be gone; the wizard  has
to refill them; also, while hit points are backed up, and the character loses
all  of  his original permanently, he may return to the backed up hit  points
(which  are  lower  than the originals), which does  not  mean,  that  he  is
immediately  cured  but that he can be cured up to those  levels,  etc.  This
spell  is no insurance against dying, but it is an insurance against  loosing
all mental or physical abilities (if the body can be salvaged. This spell  is
useful,  for example, if a wizard is feebleminded or permanently forgets  his
complete  memory (by falling into the Styx, for example) the backup kicks  in
until  the wizard can be cured. Once backup skills are used (even for a short
time only) and the original skills return, this spell ends. If the spell runs
out  while  the  originals  are not replaced, the character  will  fall  over
completely comatose. No life will be detectable.

The material component is a mirror in which the targeted creature is depicted
doing something related to the desired skill. This picture has to be captured
somehow within the mirror on a permanent basis.

This  spell banishes one slot of skills per 3 levels of the caster  from  the
target  creature. The skills which may be banished are chosen by the  caster.
Skills which may be banished are one point of THAC0, one spell, one hit point
per  Hit Die to a minimum of half hit points (not per level but per Hit Die),
one  proficiency,  one point of an ability, one psionic power,  or  even  one
complete  memory  block  (the last is under DM jurisdiction)  per  slot.  The
target  creature has a saving throw versus spell per targeted  skill;  if  it
succeeds,  the  spell  fails.  If it fails, the target  loses  the  specified
ability.  It is possible to target only one skill with all open slots  (if  a
15th-level  caster only wants to banish a fighter's THAC0, he  could  try  it
with all five slots at once, causing the fighter a -4 to the saving throw, as
one slot is used to attack the THAC0 and the remaining four slots are used to
reduce  the  chance to save). The caster of the spell can  also  split  these
slots on several different abilities. The banished abilities are lost for the
duration  of  the  spell.  Afterwards,  they  automatically  return  at  full
Strength. During the time the affected creature is only able to use its  lost
abilities like any normal person (if proficiencies) or at the reduced ability
score. It is not possible to banish curses with this spell.

The  material component is a lodestone which is shaped recognisably like  the
target  creature.  In addition, a part of that specific creature  has  to  be
attached  to the lodestone (a hair, a piece of skin, a drop of blood,  etc.).
This  spell requires some form of direct mental or physical contact with  the
target  creature throughout the casting (ESP, telepathy, a tied rope, a  hand
on the arm, etc.). If this is non-existent, the spell fails.

This  spell  takes away a single skill from one creature and  instils  it  in
another.  These skills may be anything like proficiencies, a single spell  up
to  ¬ the caster's level (round down), a base THAC0 score, ability scores,  a
single psionic power (not including PSPs yet), up to 2 PSPs per caster level,
etc.  The  affected  source creature (the target  from  which  the  skill  is
appropriated)  loses  that  specific skill at that  level,  but  retains  the
average  skill  of a normal person - unless its normal skill level  is  lower
than average (in that case halve the skill level of the source creature -  if
the  stolen  skill  is a spell, the spell is gone completely;  it  cannot  be
rememorised,  until  the  spell is cast by the thief).  This  skill  is  then
immediately  placed  either  into the caster or into  another  creature  (the
target creature) within range. Against both effects (stealing and placing the
skill) exists a saving throw versus paralysation for the respective creature;
if even one of them succeeds, the source creature retains its skill. As it is
possible  to automatically fail a saving throw, the second saving throw  will
not be necessary, if the caster is the target - and he desires the skill. The
acquired  skill then replaces an existing skill of a lower (or  non-existent)
level, but it does not augment a skill of superior level. This skill can then
be  used  by the target creature at exactly the same level as in the original
creature unless these skills are ability dependent (a wizard with a Dexterity
score   of   10   steals   a  very  dextrous  (16  Dexterity)   weaponsmith's
weaponsmithing  proficiency  which is at +6 due  to  the  smith's  incredible
skill;  then the wizard could use the weaponsmithing proficiency at his  base
Dexterity of 10, plus 6 due to the acquired skill, but he could not use it at
the  smith's  Dexterity  of  16,  plus 6 as he  did  not  steal  the  smith's
Dexterity).
The  duration of the spell is dependent on the situation in which  the  skill
was stolen or taken:
           if  it  was stolen during combat, the duration is a maximum  of  1
round per caster level;
           if  it  was  stolen during a placid moment but still  without  the
consent of the source creature it lasts for 1 turn per caster level;
           if it was taken from a complying source creature, but instilled in
an unwilling target creature, it lasts for 3 turns per level;
          if it was taken from a complying source creature and instilled into
a  willing target creature it can last for an almost unlimited time (but  see
below).
The  negative side effect is that skills, which are taken from their original
owners tend to degenerate rather quickly even if they are used often. Thus, a
skill  which is separated from its original owner for more than 10  units  of
duration  time (10 rounds, 10 turns, 30 turns, or 10 days in the  case  of  a
freely  given  and freely accepted skill) has to save once  at  the  original
owner's  ability score (if a proficiency) or versus paralysation  (if  not  a
proficiency).  If  any  of  these checks or saving  throws  fail,  the  skill
degenerates  by  one point. Once it reaches a minimum of  half  the  original
user's  skill  level,  it is completely destroyed.  If  a  reduced  skill  is
returned  to its original owner it slowly returns to its previous level  (one
point per month). A destroyed skill is lost to both the source and the target
creature.  Each skill point lost deals 10 hit points of damage to the  target
creature  as the skill tries to break out of the target's body. If the  skill
is  destroyed the creature takes 10 hit points of damage for every  remaining
point  of  skill left. If the spell runs out or is dispelled,  the  remaining
skill  returns to the source creature with no additional damage to the target
creature.
While it is definitely possible that a skill degenerates, it is also possible
that  the  skill  increases.  If the skill is a  proficiency  which  is  used
seriously enough during its stay with target creature, there is a chance that
it  increases. This chance is a base 100%, minus 5% per point of the  owner's
oproficiency  ability, minus 5% per day of duration, plus 1%  per  successful
use  of  the proficiency, plus 5% per point of the respective ability of  the
target creature over the ability of the source creature.
If  the skill is a spell stolen from another creature, the spell has a chance
of failure when it is cast. This chance is a base 10%, plus:
      20% per spell level,
      70% if used by a non-spellcaster,
      50% if used by spell caster of a different class,
       30%  if  used  by a spell caster of the same class but of insufficient
level,
       10%  if used by a spell caster of the same class but who doesn't  know
the spell;
minus:
      10% if used by a spell caster of the same class who knows the spell,
       30% if used by a spell caster of the same class who has also memorised
the same spell,
      1% per level or Hit Die of the creature.
Such  failure can be something spectacular (like a wild surge) or it can just
do  nothing. A successfully cast spell is cast as if the original caster  had
cast  it  -  not as if the target creature had cast it. Thus,  the  level  of
effect of the spell is dependent on the original caster.
It  is  possible  to  steal several skills from one or several  sources  with
successive  spells  to  be  placed into the same target  creature.  A  target
creature  can  hold a maximum of one additional skill per level  maximum.  If
this  maximum  is breached, the creature has to succeed at one  saving  throw
versus spell per round per additional skill with a -1 per additional skill (a
3rd-level  target already has three skills and suddenly gets  two  additional
skills, it has to succeed at five saving throws versus spell per round with a
-5  per  saving  throw). If any of these saving throws fail,  the  target  is
feebleminded and confused until a heal and restoration are cast on it.

The  material  components are two magnets (lodestones) which are  stoneshaped
into  the appropriate forms of the source and the target creature (they don't
have  to  pieces  of art but they have to be recognisably  the  same).  These
lodestones  are  connected by a mithril rod worth no less than  500  gp.  All
components vanish during casting.

This  spell  allows the removal of an object (or organ) from  within  another
object  (or  a  creature), instantly replacing that object  (or  organ)  with
another  of the same kind in the caster's hands. This works only with objects
or  organs the caster knows at least some facts about, and he needs  to  have
the  same  kind  of object (even if immeasurably less valuable)  as  a  fresh
carving of any kind from a fresh vegetable in his hand at the time of casting
but  it  has  to be the carving of a complete original. If the object  to  be
replaced  by the replica is within a person that person gains a saving  throw
versus  death magic. In case a vital organ (like a heart, the brain,  or  the
lungs)  are  transposed,  a  failed  saving  throw  results  in  the  (almost
immediate)  death  of  the creature, unless you replaced  it  with  a  living
replica. In that case it grafts itself into the place of the original. In the
case of an object, it only receives a saving throw (of its creator) if it  is
magical and within a magical container. Otherwise, it is immediately replaced
with  the  replica. The spell does not offer the caster any  protection  from
corrosive  or damaging effects of the replaced object (or organ). This  spell
can also be used to replace a liquid from within a container or creature:  up
to one cubic foot per level of the caster. But in that case, the caster needs
a  fluid which has almost the same coloration (not necessarily properties) as
the  replaced  fluid. Another use for this spell is to  replace  part  of  an
object  within  another object. Thus, it can be used to remove the  cancerous
part  of an organ with the help of a replacement part held by the caster.  It
would thus be possible to replace an organ with a psionic item that simulates
the  effects  of  the organ but could also produce some other  effects  (this
effect has been used to implant some psionic objects into the character which
had  the  metamorphosis power plus some other psychometabolic powers to  give
him an almost virtual invulnerability to energy attacks).

The  material component for this spell is either a small leather bag  with  a
large  button  made of tin sewn on the outside, and a small  button  made  of
platinum on the inside, which is inverted in the casting. The bag and buttons
are  destroyed in the casting. For fluids use a waterproof version of the bag
with the fluid on the inside.
Note:  if  the fluid version is used, the spell does not provide a  container
for  the  replaced  fluid, so you might want to place a container  under  the
wizard's hands, as that is the place the replaced fluid reappears.

This  spell is somewhat similar to the 5th-level lower resistance in the Tome
of  Magic. The advantage of reduce magic resistance is that it uses a  method
that eliminates the saving throw, and also reduces saving throws versus death
magic  in  addition to magic resistance for the duration of the  spell.  This
spell  was  written before the Tome of Magic was released, and now my  wizard
often uses lower resistance in favour of this one (once he obtained it),  but
this version of the spell still has better effects - if the wizard is willing
to use an 8th-level spell.
This spell works to temporarily deteriorate the innate magic resistance of  a
creature. When cast, the victim's magic resistance is reduced 3% per level of
the caster for the duration of the spell.
The  victim also has a penalty to all saving throws versus death magic  until
the  spell  expires. As an added twist, the wizard may choose to  give  up  a
spell that he has already memorised. The saving throw penalty depends on  the
spell the wizard sacrifices (for example, a 3rd-level spell sacrificed equals
-3  to  saving  throws). Reduce magic resistance absorbs  the  power  of  the
sacrificed spell upon casting. The caster must give up a spell.
For  example: a 20th-level wizard casts reduce magic resistance at a creature
with 80% magic resistance. The wizard uses a 5th-level teleport spell he  has
memorised  for  lowering the creature's saving throw. The  wizard  loses  the
teleport  spell  from memory and the creature has a -5 penalty  saving  throw
versus spell and other magic. Furthermore, the creature's magic resistance is
reduced to 20%.

This  spell  has  an initial effect exactly like that of the 1st-level  spell
clean (q.v.). In addition, refresh keeps the recipient in that condition  for
the full duration of the spell. Thus, any dirt or odour would simply not find
a  hold  upon the person. One could survive downpours of rain, wading through
mud,  and  walk through a sand storm with one's clothes clean, skin fragrant,
and hair in place (after a pass or two of the comb).
The spell also prevents the recipient from contracting any of the common non-
magical  contagious  diseases, keeps wounds from infecting,  and  blocks  the
sun's ultraviolet rays.
The  reverse  of  the  spell, dirty, has all the effects  one  would  expect:
attract dirt and filth, etc.
The spell components are a piece of soap, a small sheet of silk, and a fairly
freshly plucked rose or similar flower.

#9#
This  spell  allows  the  caster to give a touched creature  the  ability  to
regenerate  lost or drained energy levels or ability points at  a  very  slow
rate.  The effect lasts for the whole duration of the spell. If at  any  time
during the spell's effect the creature is affected by any such losses, it  is
allowed to negate the loss by succeeding at a base saving throw versus  death
magic minus one per point of damage that is dealt with the loss (if a vampire
dealt a blow causing 9 hit points damage, the affected creature would have to
succeed  at its death magic saving throw (base) minus 9 to prevent two  level
losses).  This ability also applies to ability points lost due to  sudden  or
continuous draining effects (undead drains as well as strenuous activity like
running  at  high  speeds). If any losses still occur due  to  failed  saving
throws  or  because the spell was not in effect at the time of the loss,  the
creature gains the ability to gain the losses back at the following rates:
           lost  levels  are replaced either at one per week (if  normally  a
permanent loss) or in one tenth of the time (if a temporary loss),
           lost  ability  points are replaced either at one per  week  (if  a
normally permanent loss) or in one tenth of the time (if a temporary loss).
Each  time  one  level  or  ability point loss is prevented  or  a  point  is
regained,  the duration is reduced by one week. If the remaining duration  is
less than a week, the spell instantly expires with no protection offered  nor
any  returned  point.  Thus, a 20th-level wizard would have  the  ability  to
prevent  the  loss of one point in the 19th week of duration only.  He  could
also restore only one point.
It is not possible to stack this spell.

The material components are one potion of heroism for each week or one potion
of  superheroism for every three weeks duration. These have to mixed with the
remains  of  a  cremated wraith's essence. It is possible to  substitute  any
ashes  of  any  other higher powered undead with a draining ability  for  the
wraith's essence.

By  means  of  this  spell the wizard can cause knowledge to  be  temporarily
forgotten  and  remembered at a trigger. The trigger can be  a  word,  event,
image or any other specific trigger device (eg., seeing the wizard again).
The  reverse  of  this spell, disregard, causes knowledge  or  memory  to  be
forgotten at a trigger. Again, the trigger can be a word, event, image or any
other specific trigger device (eg., being captured).
The  degree of effect of this spell depends the complexity of the trigger and
the complexity of the description of what is to be remembered or disregarded.
This spell is mainly used to shield from a read mind spell, and is especially
useful in creating fake personas for infiltration. The material component for
the spell is a brush.

This  power can remove the air from a 20 yard sphere.   This  will
stop  fires,  sound, decay, combustion other than  fires,  gaseous
attacks,  and electricity.  Physical attacks will still enter  the
area,  but  because of the lack of air, missile attacks  will  fly
different giving a -1 to hit.  Characters must hold their  breaths
as  per  the  rules in the PHB or suffer 2d8 points of damage  per
rounds.  The psionicist would also be affected if they were in the
area of effect.

Power Score:  The air is removed quickly, causing all in the  area
to suffer 2d6 points of damage from sudden decompression.

20:   The  psionicist cannot breath for 1 round  and  suffers  2d8
points of damage.

The  purpose  of  this spell is to remove scars caused  by  battle  or  other
mishaps.  Any  Comeliness that was lost due to scarring is now restored  from
application  of this spell. Larger scars may require several applications  to
remove  all the effects of the disfigurement. The material component of  this
spell is a small dressing.
The  reverse of this spell, scar, causes hideous scars to form on the targets
face  and body causing a loss of 1d3 Comeliness points. Multiple applications
of  this  spell  cannot drop Comeliness lower than 0. A saving  throw  versus
spell  will  negate the effect. The material component of the  reverse  is  a
small knife.

On  casting  this  spell, the priest is empowered to remove  scars  or  other
similar marks (burn marks, birth marks, etc.). This will enable the recipient
of  the  spell to restore lost Charisma caused by such marks. Note that  this
spell will not affect Charisma lowered by other means (magical, for example).
Charisma  can  be  restored by up to one point per 2 levels  of  the  priest,
rounded up (4 points at seventh and eighth level, 5 points at ninth and tenth
level, etc.). Charisma cannot be restored above its former value by means  of
this spell.
Multiple applications will only succeed if the recipient makes a saving throw
against  spell for each application after the first. If the saving  throw  is
unsuccessful, then no more points can be restored by the use of  this  spell.
Any additional future Charisma loss can, however, be restored. The reverse of
the  spell, bestow scars, is not permanent, but will reduce Charisma by 1d4+1
points  for  a duration of 1 turn per level of the priest. If the  victim  is
touched,  a  successful saving throw versus spell is necessary  in  order  to
negate the effects of the spell.
The  material component for both versions of this spell is the priest's  holy
symbol.

This  spell  returns  the subject to a state of physical  virginity.  If  the
subject  makes  the  saving  throw, then all sexual  skills,  knowledge,  and
techniques  are  retained; if the saving throw is failed, all  knowledge  and
skills  are  lost except those known before having lost virginity.  A  female
will  grow an intact hymen, and any physical or medical damage caused by  sex
or childbirth will be eradicated. The subject will legitimately be considered
a virgin for all religious purposes. The material component for this spell is
a white piece of silk.

This spell is a heavy-duty version of the 1st-level mend spell. It can repair
any  non-magical item, completely mend one structural point per level of  the
wizard,  and  can  fix  any magic item the wizard can  create.  The  material
component  is a complete miniature tool set appropriate to the damage  to  be
repaired. The set must be made of the finest materials and cost no less  than
200  gp.  If  a magic item is being repaired, a special tool set costing  one
tenth  the value of the damaged item, or 2000 gp, whichever is greater,  must
be used. The item must than save versus magical fire for the spell to work.

This  spell is similar to the 1st-level wizard spell mending. It will  repair
any  one object, which has a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot per level of  the
spell  caster.  For plate armour and any other object which  has  listed  hit
points  (eg., a rope of climbing), the spell restores 1 HP per level  of  the
priest.  Just  like  mending, the spell will not, in and  of  itself,  repair
magical  items  which have lost their enchantments. However, the  spell  will
repair  magical  items  which have some damage but  are  still  magical.  For
example,  the spell will restore hit points to damaged magical plate  armour,
and  can  repair  damage to a rope of climbing which has not been  completely
severed.  However, if the rope of climbing had been completely severed,  (cf.
Dungeon  Master's Guide) the spell could only repair the rope and  would  not
restore  the  lost magical properties. The material components  are  a  small
piece of metal which is consumed when the spell is cast, and the priests holy
symbol.
The  reverse  of the spell, break, does 1 points of damage per level  of  the
priest to any one item if the item has hit points, or forces the item to save
with  a  base roll of 10 if the item does not have hit points. Magical items,
or  items  with a total volume of over 1 cubic foot per level  of  the  spell
caster  are not affected by break. Failure indicates that the item has broken
into 1d8+2 pieces. In both cases, the priest must touch the item, requiring a
successful attack roll against an unwilling recipient.

This  spell  causes past events to be re-enacted in the area of  effect.  The
replayed  events will consist of a three dimensional, semi-transparent  image
superimposed over the area of effect.
The  wizard  can freeze the action, reverse it, scan forward for a particular
event,  or  skip to any time within the range of the spell as  given  in  the
table below.

     Level     Time Range
     12-14     1 day per level
     15-17     1 month per level
     18-20     1 year per level
     21+  1 century per level

The  speed of a search is determined by the event that is sought. The passage
of an army would be easy to spot at a fast search rate, while searching for a
pickpocket would require a real time search.

The material component fthis spell is an hourglass.

This  spell allows the priest to command any reptile within range as long  as
the reptile can hear him and he does not exploit it. Only normal reptiles can
be  affected, including variants in size. Thus lizards, giant lizards,  etc.,
can  be commanded, but dragons can not. The command must be given in a  short
sentence  of at most 25 words. The reptile will automatically understand  the
language  the  priest is speaking. Since familiars are not considered  to  be
normal  animals,  they  cannot  be commanded  by  this  spell.  The  material
component of this spell is a reptile's tail.

By casting this spell, a priest can ask a particular animal for a favour. The
priest  must have some sort of enticement for the animal to actually  perform
the  favour, because the animal can opt not to carry out the priest's wishes.
The  casting  time  of this spell is 1 plus the time necessary  to  make  the
request, which may take no longer than one turn. This spell does not  empower
the priest to actually speak the animal's language.
For example: if a priest spotted an owl, the priest could request the owl, if
it  saw  any  other humanoids around, to fly back and alert  the  priest.  An
appropriate offering might be some choice part of a rabbit, a mouse, or  some
other  form of owl snack food. If the owl was actually required to fly patrol
all  night  (and forego hunting, a favourite owl activity) then probably  the
owl would turn him down no matter what the priest offered.

By  casting this spell, the caster can select any one of his spells currently
memorized, and then reshape the pattern it has taken in his brain  into  that
of  another spell, while looking at a scroll or his spell book to select  the
new pattern he wants it to be in.
It  can only make a spell's energy into that of a lower spell, since some  of
the  energy  will go lost, and the two spells have to be in the same  school.
Also, the new spell has a maximum spell level of 6 (when the caster can  cast
7th-level spells, he has to shape a 7th-, 8th- or 9th-level spell into a 6th-
level spell).
This  spell is there to use in emergencies when you studied the wrong  spell,
and  you  have  only a short time to relearn a new spell. If  the  caster  is
disturbed while casting this spell, the energy is lost.

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level resist water (q.v.). It is completely

priest ever before developed a spell against it is a mystery to me.

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level resist water (q.v.). It is completely

lovely  big sandy desert and then think of wind and presto: you got it  (come
to  think  of  it, it is normally used only in deserts and on  the  plane  of
dust).

#9#
This  spell is similar to the priest spells resist fire and resist cold.  The
spell adds +3 to all saving throws against electricity or electrical attacks,
and  further  reduces  all  damage by 50%. Thus, a  successful  saving  throw
indicates that quarter damage is taken and failure indicates that half damage
is taken.
The material component for this spell is a small piece of rubber.

walking on harsh and refrozen snow, sliding down very sharp icicles, etc.

This  spell  is  used to protect a priest against becoming  intoxicated  when
drinking,  which is typically unbecoming of the clergy. The alcohol  ingested
during the duration is mystically less effective. The priest has a +1 per two
levels bonus to his Constitution check to resist becoming (more) intoxicated.
Note  that  it is still possible to become drunk while protected, but  it  is
much more difficult.
The  material components that are consumed at casting time are a raw  chicken
egg, a red pepper, a Chile pepper, and a pint of spring water.

When  cast  on  a  willing being, this spell confers 2% magic resistance  per
level  of  the  wizard.  If  the being already has magic  resistance,  it  is
increased, but will never exceed 90%. This spell is not cumulative, i.e.  you
cannot cast two on one person. The first must expire before the second can be
cast. The material component is the dried heart of a mind flayer.

This  spell  grants a willing recipient the ability to better resist  poison.
The spell grants a +1 saving throw bonus versus poison for every three levels

gains  a normal saving throw versus any poison that would not normally  grant
one.

This  spell  allows the recipient (human, humanoid, or animal) to go  without
sleep for twice the normal duration. This duration includes retroactive  time
without sleep before the spell was cast. For example, a character who can  go
a maximum of 36 hours without sleep, and has already been awake for 36 hours,
can extend the time without sleep for another 36 hours (72 hours total).
This  spell can also counter the effects of a sleep spell, although the spell
is ended immediately upon doing so. Resist sleep will also negate the effects
of  exhaustion  from normal activity. Normal activity includes light  labour,
travelling  at  normal  speed, etc. Characters travelling  at  top  speed  or
engaged in heavy fighting or work will fatigue normally.

The material component for the spell is a handful of sand.

This  spell is similar to the 3rd-level resist water (q.v.). It is completely
alike,  save  that it offers protection from phenomena that are connected  to
vacuum,  instead  of  water. This spell is for those  space  travellers  that
somehow  seem  to find themselves floating around in wildspace a  little  too
often  or  those  that  seem to land in those ugly vacuum  rooms  which  have
absolutely air-tight doors and then increase their size magically to very big
(still  having  the same amount of air in a room which is now 1000  feet  per
side which was previously 10 feet per side causes quite a decompression)  and
for  those guys that find themselves rushing up from 3000 feet depth  in  the
ocean  to  the surface of the ocean   normally any creature which  does  this
goes pop.

This spell is similar to the resist fire and resist cold spells of first  and
second  level. Similar to these, it reduces the damage the protected creature
takes by the appropriate effects by half before saving throws are rolled.  In
addition,  it  offers a bonus of +2 to the saving throw  against  water.  The
material component is the holy symbol of the priest.
Resist water is for those that don't fancy to be pounded by huge waves on the
ocean,  those that don't like to get wet in the rain (or in the  sea),  those
that don't like to be flooded by a transmute dust to water, which is normally
quite  a  killer  spell (one cubic yard of water normally weighs  nearly  one
ton), etc.

This spell enables an item with the spellcasters wizard mark inscribed on  it
to  be  instantly  summoned. The item must weigh no more than  5  pounds  per
level.  The item must have a wizard mark of the spellcaster's glyph inscribed
upon it.
When  this  spell  is cast the wizard can see in his mind all  wizard  marked
items  that  have  his glyph. The glyph and the extra six characters  (wizard
mark does this) can be read. The wizard concentrates on one set of glyphs and
the  object  that has that set of glyphs inscribed on it is  summoned.  If  a
unique  glyph and set of characters is not available, the DM should  randomly
pick which object is summoned. Only one object can be summoned per spell.
The  glyphs  can be seen even if they exist on a neighbouring plane  (but  no
further).  But  only items existing on the same plane as the  caster  can  be
retrieved. The plane that they are on is revealed, though. Only the glyph and
characters are seen, not the object itself.
This  makes wizard mark a much more useful spell to have. It also makes erase
very important to wizards that steal other wizard's spell books.

This  spell enables an item with the wizard's wizard mark inscribed on it  to
be  instantly summoned. The item may weigh no more than one pound per  level.
The item must have a wizard mark of the wizard's glyph inscribed upon it.
When  this  spell is cast, the wizard can see in his mind all  wizard  marked
items  that  have  his glyph. The glyph and the extra six characters  can  be
read.  The  wizard concentrates on one set of glyphs, and the item with  that
set  of  glyphs inscribed on it is summoned. Only one object can be  summoned
per  casting of the spell. During the course of the spellcasting, the  bearer
of  the item will feel a small tugging sensation on the item. If no one is in
physical  contact  with the item at the completion of the casting  no  saving
throw  for  retrieval  is  required: the spell is an  automatic  success.  If
someone  is  in  physical contact with the item, and he  rolls  a  successful
saving throw versus spell, the item will not be retrieved.
The  item  must be within 1 mile per level of the wizard to be retrieved.  If
the  item  is  outside of this range, the glyphs will still  be  seen  and  a
general direction of where the item is will be indicated. If the item is  not
on the same plane as the wizard then no information will be given.
Only the glyph and the characters from the wizard mark are seen, not the item
itself.  If  more  than one item is inscribed with the  same  glyph  and  six
characters,  the  DM  should randomly pick one of  the  items  and  give  the
appropriate result.

The  material component is a 500 gp diamond which should be gazed through for
the  duration of the spell. The diamond disappears at the end of the casting.
The item will replace the diamond.

This  spell  lets you actually cast dispel magic to counter a  spell  already
thrown at you. If you have memorised the spell, you can cast it at any  spell
or  spell effect thrown that round, even if you have been killed or turned to
stone,  by  the vagaries of initiative and the like. It is assumed  that  you
were  casting dispel magic as the other spell was being cast. This spell acts
as dispel magic for chance of success based on level.
For  example, you have Esmeralda cast polymorph other, which is  lots  faster
than  dispel magic. She has initiative all over Glamgon, the PC. He  declares
that  he  wants to cast retroactive dispel magic, so effectively as Esmeralda
was  gathering  power for her spell, Glamgon was trying  to  drain  it  away.
Glamgon had better succeed, lest he truly become a toad (the outcome  of  the
polymorph other, should retroactive dispel magic not succeed).
Note  that  this spell cannot be cast by a specialised Abjurer or Transmuter,
since it also belongs to his opposite school.

This spell will remove 5 HP from the caster's maximum permanently, but allows
the  caster to defy death once per casting. Once he dies from grievous wounds

The  caster  of  this spell receives a mental impression of the  most  recent
owner  or  owners  of  the  recipient object. An "owner"  is  defined  as  an
intelligent entity who was in direct physical contact (i.e., no gloves)  with
the  object  one hour, or who had the object upon his person  for  24  hours.
These time requirements may be divided by the wizard's level, and for every 4
levels  of  the wizard, one previous owner can be identified. Thus,  an  8th-
level  wizard, for example, could determine the last two owners  who  carried
the object for at least 3 hours each.
The information gained is sufficient that the wizard will recognise the owner
on  sight, and he can uniquely specifthe owner for the purpose of such spells
as legend lore. The material component of this spell is a handful of dust.

This  spell gives the caster complete knowledge of the target's skin spectra,
which  the  caster can communicate without error (via telepathy or with  some
visible  illusion for a number of rounds following the casting equal  to  the
caster's Intelligence). The caster must remain stationary and concentrate  on
the  subject  for  a  full  two rounds in order  to  reveal  each  and  every
individual spectral line; if the caster concentrates for only one  round,  he
will  learn  only the actual number of spells of each spell  level  that  the
target  has  prepared.  The target is allowed a saving  throw  versus  spell,
which, if successful hides all special spectral information from the caster.
This  spell was originally written as a spell to be used in conjunction  with
the "chromatic wizard" character class.

This  spell permanently reverses the alignment of any creature that  fails  a
saving throw versus death magic. Any neutral portion of an alignment will  go
to one of the extremes (a 50-50 chance of either one). True neutral will thus
go to one of the extremes (lawful good, chaotic good, lawful evil, or chaotic
evil: equal chance of each one). Creatures that are not intelligent enough to
have an alignment, such as many animals, are not affected by this spell.  The
only  way to reverse this spell is through a restoration. Creatures that fail
their saving throw will immediately begin to act in accordance with their new
alignment, and will resist any effort to have it reversed back.

Under  the  influence of this spell, the subject experiences  transsexuality,
the  unshakable  conviction  that  he (or she)  is,  despite  all  biological
evidence,  of  the  opposite gender than the true  one.  The  subject  cannot
disbelieve  or  be  persuaded  otherwise, and will  immediately  adapt  hair,
clothing,  manners, speech, behaviours, etc., accordingly. Notice that  males
will behave in a feminine rather than an effeminate manner, and similarly for
females;  the subject has no desire to parody. If the subject's  species  has
more  than  two genders, the resulting gender orientation is DM's choice.  If
the  species  has  only one gender, the subject is unaffected.  The  material
component of this spell is a piece of wood with a yin-and-yang symbol  carved
upon it.
Like  embarrassing fetish and reverse sexual orientation, this spell  has  no
saving  throw  per  se.  Upon first consciously realizing  that  one's  self-
identification  as  male  or female has changed, if the  subject  strenuously
objects, the subject is allowed a Charisma check at -4. A successful Charisma
check  leaves the subject confused but no longer transsexual. A new  Charisma
check may be made each day, but at a cumulative penalty of -1 per day. A roll
of 1 always succeeds.
Notice that gender orientation and sexual orientation are different concepts,
and  that this spell alone will not change orientation. However, the  subject
will claim a different orientation based on the differently perceived gender.
Thus  a straight female will consider herself a male who is attracted to men,
and  therefore  a  gay man; likewise a lesbian will consider  herself  a  man
attracted to women, hence a straight man.

      This  spell  temporarily converts a creature's sexual orientation  from
hetero- to homosexual, or vice versa. A bisexual who favours one gender  will
now favour the other, and a bisexual equally disposed towards both genders is
unaffected.  Asexual creatures or creatures of species  with  more  than  two
genders will be affected, if at all, by DM's discretion.

      There is no saving throw per se against this spell. Rather, upon  first
experiencing sexual attraction in the altered way, or upon first  questioning
one's  unexpected  lack  of  accustomed sexual attraction,  the  subject,  if
strenuously disapproving, is allowed a Constitution check at -4. A successful
Constitution check will experience a strong but repressive erotic  attraction
towards  a single individual for 1 round per level of the spellcaster,  after
which  the effects permanently vanish. A new Constitution check may  be  made
once  per  day, but with a cumulative penalty of -1 per day.  A  check  of  1
always succeeds.

The  material  component is a concave lump of clay which the caster  remoulds
into a convex lump.

This  spell  is a magical implementation of the divine edict "an eye  for  an
eye". A single revisitation can reproduce all or part of the damage that  the
priest  has  ever suffered at the hands of the target (priest's option),  but
any  single injury may be revisited only once. The priest must name aloud all
injuries  he  wants revisited on the target. Only those injuries suffered  by
the priest which went unredressed are eligible for revisitation.
If,  for  example, a bandit's surprise sword attack has blinded  the  priest,
then  the  effect of revisitation will be to blind the bandit.  If  a  dragon
swoops  down from the sky, breaths fire on a priest for 20 points of  damage,
and  turns  to fly away, then the spell would produce 20 points of damage  on
the  dragon. However, if the same dragon was on the ground and breathed  fire
on  the  priest, and if the priest responded with a spiritual hammer  attack,
doing  the  dragon  4 HP of damage, then the breath weapon  attack  would  be
ineligible for revisitation purposes.
If  this  spell  is used to revisit an injury which would  be  fatal  to  the
target,  then  the  target  is allowed a saving  throw  versus  death  magic.
Creatures making this saving throw take half damage and fall unconscious  for
1d6 rounds.
This spell can be used as a cooperative magic spell. When two or more priests
are  available, the spell can be used to redress injuries received  by  third
parties. One priest casts a zone of truth or true speak, and the other  casts
revisitation.  At  the  crucial moment, the injured third  party,  under  the
effect  of  a truth spell, names the grievances to be redressed.  The  priest
casting  revisitation  then repeats the list of injuries  and  the  spell  is
completed.
The  material component is the priest's holy symbol, and a balance or a  part
of a broken weapon.

This  spell allows the priest who casts it (normally a druid) to restore  the
life  force of any plant or monster of vegetable nature that he touches.  The
spell works on any one tree or on any area of small plants or shrubs of  size
at  most  2 square yards per level. The plant or area of vegetation may  have
been  dead  for  10 years per level of the druid. The spell  regenerates  all
missing parts, so it may be used to restore a living tree from a decades  old
tree  stump,  or a flower patch from a bunch of dried flowers.  Plants  which
normally grow in soil may be revived only in soil.
The material component for this spell is a bit of dung.

utter  indifference. The material component of this spell is a leech  or  the

The  wizard  will automatically detect any scrying attempt  in  the  area  of
effect. The scryer must make a saving throw versus spell to realise that  the
scrying  is  being  tampered with. If he does not immediately  terminate  the
scrying, the caster of the counter-scry gets a clear image of the spy  and  a
general  location.  He can cast any ranged spells through  the  link  at  the
scryer, who receives all normal saving throws. The caster of the counter-scry
can also simply jolt the scryer, causing the connection to be terminated. The
detection  of a scrying attempt will interrupt spell-casting. It is suggested
that  detect scrying be made a 2nd-level spell, with a more limited  duration
and  vaguer  description of the scryer. The material  component  is  a  small
silver mirror.

Provided  the wizard is conscious and within the area of effect, he  will  be
made  aware of any spellcasting conducted in that area. The particular  spell
cast  is not made known, but the location of the wizard is, precisely if  the
wizard  is  familiar with the area, generally otherwise. The notification  is
sufficient   to  disrupt  casting  in  progress,  unless  it  is  consciously
suppressed  before casting (if suppressed, the wizard does  not  realise  the
scan was triggered). Material component is a handful of crystal dust.

The  wizard  casts this spell, and hurls a small carved scarab  at  a  target
within  range. A creature or object in a creature's possession gets a  saving
throw to avoid the scarab. It clings invisibly to its victim, noticed only in
a  determined  search.  The  wizard then always knows  where  the  victim  is
(distance and direction), provided it is within one mile per level,  and  the
target  is  not enclosed in lead. The tracker can be renewed each morning  by
recasting the spell.

Designed  to prevent the casting of spells in the area of effect, the  wizard
stomper  produces a nearly uncontrollable surge of energy into a  wizard  who
attempts to draw power for a spell. The victim must save versus spell at  -6.
Failure means the spell is aborted and the wizard takes 1d6 damage per  level
of the spell attempted. If the saving throw is made, the spell can be cast at
+1 on all damage dice, but at double normal casting time.
If  a  wizard has been stomped before, and knows what to expect,  the  saving
throw is only at -3.

The material component is a handful of ruby dust worth at least 25 gp.

This  spell affects only creatures up to 1_ the caster's level or  Hit  Dice.
The victim of the spell must make a saving throw versus death magic (with a -
4  modifier  to the saving throw). Failing this saving throw results  in  the
victims  death, utterly, with no hope of resurrection unless a  divine  being
raises him. The caster can use this stolen life to do one of 5 things:
          Waste it, soul is destroyed, a great howling is heard.
          Use to heal self for 1d6 per level of victim.
          Use to hurt another for 1d8 per level victim.
           Pervert  it,  changes  victim  into  an  equal  Hit  Dice  undead,
determined at random.
          Destroy an equal number of Hit Dice of undead with no saving throw.

This  spell  causes the caster's hands to transform into claws similar  to  a
glabrezu's. They cannot be affected or dispelled by any form of magic  (short
of  a  wish).  Mordenkainen's disjunction works with the same chance  as  for
artifacts.  The  hands can be targeted by an opponent  with  weapons  at  the
Armour  Class of the caster. Each claw can absorb double the caster's maximum
hit points. If they take that amount of damage, the caster loses the hand  as
the  claw crumbles to dust. They can be regenerated. Each hand has 7  digits,
and each digit has 5 inch fingernails. The THAC0 is equal to the wizard's but
the  claws  can penetrate any armour (or Armour Class) on an 18 or better  on
1d20.  They are considered to be a weapon, +5 only for the purposes for  what
can  be hit. The +5 bonus does not count towards the THAC0. They can hit  any
creature,  even  those that require special weapons like cold  iron,  silver,
etc.  For each claw that hits roll 1d6+1. This is the number of digits  which
cause  damage. Each digit causes 5 points of rending damage. In  addition  to
this damage, each claw which hits forces the target to save versus poison  at
-1  per  digit.  If the saving throw fails, the victim dies within  8  rounds
(minus  one  per digit) unless it receives a neutralise poison  spell  within
this  time.  The victim might still take damage as described below.  Any  hit
points  lost  due to poison are still lost. If the victim succeeds  with  its
saving throw it takes still another 2 points poison damage per digit.
If  both  claws hit, the caster has the chance to rend his opponent: the  die
roll  to  determine how many digits penetrate gains a +3 per die, up  to  the
maximum of 7 digits per claw. If maximum damage is dealt the creature has  to
succeed at a third saving throw versus poison at -14 (due to the amount).  If
failed, it dies immediately. If the saving throw succeeds, it still takes  20
points additional damage (in addition to those described above).
The caster cannot shorten the duration of the spell in any way except with  a
full  wish.  The caster cannot cast any other spells during the  duration  of
this  spell  as  it  interrupts the necessary concentration  and  the  manual
dexterity is not high enough with these claws.

The  material component is a complete set of claws from a glabrezu which  are
encased  in a platinum sheath. This sheath has to be forged as to  contain  a
small set of poison reservoirs containing a single dose of type E poison. The
whole  set  costs  no less than 10,000 gp per set. Where  to  get  a  set  of
glabrezu  claws  and  finding the jeweller to sheath  them  in  platinum  and
outfitting them with the poison is the character's job.

With this spell, the priest can cause a rock to find its way into the shoe of
the victim. If the victim has no shoes, the spell causes a thorn or something
to  stick into the foot of the victim. The material component for this  spell
is  a  small  stone  or thorn, that is to be thrown in the direction  of  the
victim. It is consumed in the victim's shoe or foot.

      This  spell allows the caster to remove all of his clothing and replace
it with another set of clothing in an instant. This clothing can be normal or
magical,  metal armour or leather, anything the wizard is currently  wearing.
However, the spell cannot place armour onto the caster's body. The clothes to
be  donned  must be within the spell range. The material component  for  this
spell is a piece of parchment with the word "wardrobe" written in elvish. The
somatic  and material components consist of the cast pointing at himself  and
saying the magic word "Hannskrischenandersun!".

      Origins:  a  grey  elf  mage/thief  once  lived  in  Furyondy  and  was
apprenticed at his uncle's, the magister of a castle deep in the heart of the
country. He was always having to take off his leather armour in order to cast
spells, so he decided to research a spell that would allow him to change  out
of it in an instant.

      Unfortunately for poor Roland, he was executed by the new magister  who
hated elves. However, it was fortunate that he did not research it because it
wouldn't  have worked the way he wanted it to. You see, having  a  4  Wisdom,
Roland never figured out that you can't ever cast this spell in armour.

This  spell  allows the caster to change the cut and design of  the  target's
clothes  and  armour as he sees fit during the duration of  the  spell.  This
spell may be used to alter the caster's clothing into armour and change  them
back again at will during the duration of the spell. If the target is not the
caster  then  the recipient is allowed to make a saving throw each  time  his
outfit  is  changed or altered. The material component for this  spell  is  a
miniature  wardrobe  carved  out of wood. The  verbal  and  somatic  gestures
consist of dancing around in a little jig and saying "Seven with one blow!".
Origins: Roland thought that this spell would be more useful because he would
be  able to change in and out of armour at will. In addition he thought  that
if anyone were to annoy him or try casting spells he could make their clothes
ill-fitting  or clad them in heavy armour, making spell casting difficult  if
not  impossible. However, he again never saw his short-sightedness and  never
foresaw  the possibility of having to take his armour off in the first  place
in order to cast this spell.

By  means of this spell, the druid causes a willing recipient's feet, paws or
hooves  to  be firmly rooted to the ground, becoming immovable. The  creature
gains  an extra saving throw versus paralysation at +4 to avoid being  thrown
back,  picked  up, knocked down or blown around. Success means  the  creature
remains  standing; failure indicates the situation is to be handled normally,
with  another saving throw if allowed. The recipient may "root" and  "unroot"
at  will,  as long as it occurs within the duration of the spell. Rooting  or
unrooting takes one tenth of a round, giving a  1 penalty to initiative.  The
recipient  may  not  perform any action requiring legwork (walking,  running,
etc.)  while  rooted.  At he end of the spell's duration,  the  recipient  is
automatically unrooted.
Optionally,  the  spell may be cast upon an unwilling subject  (who  must  be
touched  by  the  druid and fail a saving throw versus  spell  at   2  to  be
affected).  Unlike the druid, the victim has no control over the  spell  once
touched  and  is  anchored  until released by the druid,  the  root  duration
expires  or  it  is  dispelled. The material components for  this  spell  are
mistletoe and a small piece of root from a large tree, preferably oak.
Root  is  one  of  the  special prayers granted by Saint Timorel,  patron  of
druidical groves and retreats.

This  is  a  more  powerful,  as  well as earlier,  version  of  the  greater
shatterwave. Roteley designed the lesser version later to be more  practical,
but  is  still  fond  of  using the greater version in  the  laboratories  of
unfriendly  wizards. This version is the same as the lesser shatterwave,  but
with the above and following changes. All saving throws for items are at  -2;
monsters save at -1. Damage is 1d4 HP plus one hit point per 2 levels  (round
up), with stunning at 10 seconds per point of damage. Skeletons and such take
1d8  points  of  damage, plus one hit point per level,  again  with  stunning
effects as above. Magic items have a +3 total on their saving throw. Example:
A  20th-level wizard casts this spell. The wave will start within 40 feet  of
the  caster's  hand, and it will follow a 100-foot long  path  10  feet  wide
straight  out.  An  owlbear struck by the wave would take  1d4+10  points  of
damage and be stunned for (1d6+15)/10 rounds.
These spells were designed as large scale versions of the shatter spell which
the  wizard would still have some control over (they are direction specific).
They  are  also useful in that the wizard need not touch the object affected,
and more than one object can be targeted.

This  spell  creates a wave of force a short distance from the caster's  hand
which follows a cylindrical path away from the caster. The wave starts within
the  stated  range and then moves away within the full area of  effect.  This
wave  of  force has an effect similar to a shatter spell. All glass, ceramic,
bone,  or other fragile material touched by the wave must save versus  normal
blow  or be cracked, shattered, and ruined. Magical items have a +5 on  their
saving throw. The wave can be stopped by large, heavy objects that block most
of  the wave, such as a stone wall, iron chest, oak door (though the door may
crack), etc. The wave has limited offensive power against creatures with hard
parts  (skeletons). The wave will do 1d2 points of damage, plus one hit point
per  four levels of the caster, rounded up, as well as stun for a like number
of  tenths  of  a round. Skeletons and similar creatures take 1d4  points  of
damage  plus  1 HP per 2 levels, as well as full stunning effects.  The  wave
itself  is visible as an orange-red convex disk. Example: a 10th-level wizard
casts  this  spell.  The wave would appear within 10 feet  of  his  hand  and
proceed to travel out on a 25-foot long path, 5 feet wide. An orc within this
path  would  take 1d2+3 points of damage, as well as get stunned for  a  like
number of tenths of a round.

     This powerful spell can inflict a great deal of damage, but it harms the
wizard  in the process. With this spell, the wizard himself becomes a channel
for  a  bolt of raw, destructive energy. The wizard, however, becomes greatly
damaged by this channelling; the more powerful the bolt, the more damage  the
wizard  takes. When this spell is cast, the wild wizard takes 1d3  points  of
damage per level he posses, plus an optional 1 HP per level (the caster  need
not  use all the optional damage). For each point of damage the wizard takes,
the  bolt does 1d4 in damage to the target. For example, a 10th-level  wizard
with  38  HP  uses  a  bolt  with an additional 7 points  of  damage  (he  is
guaranteed at least one hit point left). The wizard rolls 10d3+7, and gets  a
total of 29. The wizard takes 29 points of damage, and the target takes  29d4
in  damage.  Note that there is no saving throw for the wizard or  target  to
reduce damage. The wizard can cast this spell as if at a lower level in order
to reduce damage taken. Certain spells will offer some protection against the
bolt  (for  the  target  only): shield: absorbs one  dice  damage  per  round
duration left, rounded up, shield duration reduced appropriately; minor globe
of  invulnerability:  as  above,  one round  per  3  dice  damage;  globe  of
invulnerability: as above, one round per 5 dice damage; brooch of  shielding:
one charge per two dice damage absorbed.

     Spells or prefixes (White Wolf Magazine) which augment damage affect the
damage the caster takes; the target, however, only takes 1d2 points in damage
for  each augmented point the caster takes. For example, if the caster  above
could do an extra point of damage per die from another spell affect, he would
take  39  points  of  damage, knocking him unconscious,  doing  29d4+10d2  in
damage, raising the average damage from 73 to 88 HP, probably at the cost  of
his life.

     The damage incurred from a wildbolt, for both the caster and target, can
be healed normally.

enchant.  This  takes 1 turn per stone, and requires a Dexterity  check.  The
stones  must be semi-precious in nature at least, or worth 5 gp or more.  The
spell is then cast upon the stones whereupon each one becomes a grenade doing
6d4  points of damage to all within 5 feet when thrown. The stones can be put
in slings, or simply thrown. Anyone can throw these stones.

This  spell  allows the wizard to inscribe a rune containing the energies  of
one  spell up to ninth level. Instructions of up to 1 word per level  may  be
given  to control the rune. The material components are 100 gp worth of  gems
and  inks  per level of the spell contained in the rune. Since few areas  can
support 10th-level magic, this spell is extremely rare.

This  is a spell that allows wizards to infuse the magical symbols they  draw
(see below) with the power needed to repel summoned or extraplanar creatures.
The  maximum  Hit Die creature that may be fenced in or out is equal  to  the
wizard's level plus four.
Note:  as  the  above  implies,  it is possible  to  fence  out  summoned  or
extraplanar  creatures  of  less  than 4 HD  by  using  the  symbols  without
runetrue.
The only symbols that this spell empowers are listed below:

     Symbol    Protects from
     Pentacle  Demons, demodands
     Pentagram Devils, daemons
     Magic circle   Spirits of good
     Magic (protection) circle     Undead
     Thaumaturgic circle Spirits of nature and neutrality
     Thaumaturgic triangle         Elementals

The wizard must still create the symbol manually, using anything from a stick
to gold inlay.

This  spell, devised by my gnome illusionist primarily as a good prank spell,
causes  all  of  the  target's  clothing and  bodily  possessions  to  become
invisible,  but not the target itself. The target sees his or her clothes  as
they normally are. Swords in scabbards are considered bodily possessions, but
not  if  in  hand. Any clothes put on after the spell is cast do  not  become
invisible. Invisible items remain so for the duration of the spell  or  until
dispelled.

This  spell  allows  the  priest to give up some of  hit  points  to  another
character in order that he is be better capable to complete a quest. This  is
not  current,  but  maximum hit points. The condition is  reversed  when  the
character  returns from the quest successfully. If the character  fails,  the
hit points return to the priest at the rate of 1 per week.
Here's  an  example:  suppose a high level priest  (with  78  HP)  wants  Sir
Belvedere  (80 HP) to retrieve a magical mace that was stolen. Sir  Belvedere
agrees,  but  only if the priest sacrifices 70 of his hit points,  to  ensure
good  faith  and  to help complete the mission. The priest  agrees,  and  Sir
Belvedere  goes  out  in  search of the mace. At  this  point  Sir  Belvedere
effectively  has  150 HP, and, for all intents and purposes his  maximum  hit
points is now 150. Likewise, the priest's maximum hit point total is now 8.
Now  suppose Sir Belvedere is successful in his mission. When he delivers the
mace to the priest, they both immediately return to their normal maximum  hit
point  value,  although perhaps not their current hit  point  value,  if  Sir
Belvedere  is wounded. Current damage to the spell recipient is split  evenly
among the two when hit points are returned.
Now  suppose  Sir Belvedere was killed before the mission was complete.  That
means  that  the  priest will have to wait 70 weeks until he returns  to  his
normal maximum hit point total.

The salt to flesh spell turns any salt into flesh. If the salt was originally
living, this spell restores life and possessions provided a successful system
shock  roll is made. Thus, any creature transformed into salt can be restored
to  flesh  regardless of size. When cast upon ordinary salt, the  caster  can
affect a volume of 10 cubic feet per level. In this case, the flesh is  inert
and lifeless.
The  reverse,  flesh  to  salt,  turns flesh  of  any  sort  into  salt.  All
possessions are converted to salt also. The victim is allowed a saving  throw
versus  polymorph  to  resist the effects of this spell.  If  the  target  is
currently  suffering from dehydration, he suffers a  1 penalty to his  saving
throw  roll  for each day of dehydration (to a maximum of  4). Failure  means
that the victim is immediately turned into a statue of salt. As with flesh to
stone, any statue created by this spell is subject to breakage or weathering;
however  since salt is more fragile than stone, the resulting statue is  more
susceptible to these threats.
Salt  statues  are  especially susceptible to liquids and blowing  sand.  Any
statue  exposed  to  at least one gallon of liquid or prolonged  exposure  to
blowing  sand in excess of 20 miles per hour suffers damage per the following
table,  and  the victim, once restored to flesh, appears as if  mutilated  by
acid.  The  DM  rolls 1d4 and modifies the roll depending upon  the  type  of
damage.  For  water damage, the DM modifies the roll by adding  1  for  every
gallon  of liquid. For wind damage, the DM adds 1 for every 20 miles of  wind
speed  multiplied by the number of hours exposed. For example, a salt stature
is  exposed to a sand storm with 40mph winds for 3 hours. The DM rolls  3  on
1d4,  modifies  the  roll  by +6, and consults the following  table  for  the
effects under 9. The victim, if returned to flesh, permanently loses 5 points
of Charisma and 9 HP. As can be seen, the effects are cumulative.

     Modified
     D4 Roll   Effects
      1  4   Restored individual is horribly scarred, Charisma reduced  by  5
points  (cannot  be  reduced below 1). This damage  can  only  be  healed  by
regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      5  9   Restored individual permanently loses hit points  equal  to  the
modified  roll (but cannot be reduced below 1 HP). This damage  can  only  be
healed by regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      10  14      One  of  the victim's limbs is unusable;  the  DM  randomly
determines which, using 1d4 (1: left arm; 2: right arm; 3: left leg; 4: right
leg). This damage can only be healed by regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      15+   Restored individual is dead. He can be brought back to life  with
resurrection,  wish, or similar magic. Note: raise dead will not  work  since
the body will not be whole.

The material component is a small statue carved from salt.

This  spell creates a magical symbol similar to that produced by a  glyph  of
warding.  It is inscribed in the air, does not move, and provides  protection
from  either law, chaos, good, or evil, in the following manner:  should  any
creature of the specified alignment enter the area of effect, the priest will
be  mentally alerted to its presence, even awakened from sleep, provided that
the  priest  is  himself  within the area of effect. Note  that  the  warning
message to the priest gives neither its alignment nor its location, and  only
the priest receives said message. The material component is burning incense.

      This simple spell allows wizards to create small glass objects (up to 3
pounds)  out  of  sand.  If used creatively, it is a  handy  spell  for  many
situations. The caster can shape the glass in any way he wants, but trying to
duplicate  an existing object or creating something complex or valuable  will
require  the  proper  artistic proficiencies. The caster can  produce  either
transparent  or  translucent glass. Common products of this spell  are  cups,
bowls, vials, small windows, crystal bullets, cutting shards, and so on.  The
spell itself doesn't produce sharp enough edges for cutting, but this can  be
done  after  the  glass is made. It takes at least one round to  prepare  the
glass,  plus  a  variable  time for the shaping, dependant  on  the  object's
complexity (DM's discretion).

The  material component of this spell is a small crystal lens to  concentrate
any  light  source  stronger than torchlight on the sand.  The  lens  is  not
expended.

      By  this spell, the wizard will cover himself with sand that will repel
damage. The wizard will be able to cover himself with enough sand to block  8
HP  +  1 HP per level of damage. The type of sand used causes the body to  be
slightly shaded to that colour. The spell lasts until all the points are used
up. Multiple casting only raise you back to the maximum of a single casting.

The  material components needed are: ground granite, sandstone, or some other
type of fine sand.

This spell creates a sand storm from any convenient source of sand, gravel or
loose topsoil in the area of effect, which may be used either defensively  or
offensively. In its defensive capacity, the sandstorm may be used as a  cloak
for an escape or as a means of blocking pursuit. In an offensive capacity, it
may be centred on one or more persons and have effects on them. The degree of
the  storm created is variable, based on a 1d20 roll on the table below.  For
every  3  levels  of  the wizard casting the spell, the  wizard  may  add  or
subtract  a  1 modifier. Unless noted as such, there is no saving  throw  for
effects.

Note  that  any  man-sized or smaller flying creature is downed  by  a  heavy
storm,  large  creatures  are  downed by a  turbulent  storm  and  gargantuan
creatures are downed by an extreme storm.

The  material component of the spell is a handful of fine sand which is blown

This  spell can have one of two effects. First, it can be used as a  pounding
shower  of sand, which rains down for one round in a 60 foot diameter  circle
inflicting 1d12 HP of buffeting damage plus 1d12 HP of choking damage to  all
creatures  within the area of effect. Certain creatures would  be  immune  to
such  effects, it is up to the DM's discretion (i.e. golems) Also, undead  do
not  need  to breathe. The second use of the spell can be used as a  blinding
rain of sand in a 60 foot diameter circle which lasts for one round per level
of  the caster slowing movement to 50% and reducing visibility to zero within
the  area  of  effect.  The sheet can also extinguish  open  flames  such  as
torches, candles, camp fires, etc...
The material component for the spell is a handful of fine sand.

      This  spell  confers immunity to all "nuisance" cantrips and  1st-level
spells  cast upon the bard. In addition, it gives the bard a +4 bonus to  his
saving  throws  versus such spells of second level or higher. This  spell  is
primarily used while performing, as it keeps outside events such as  hecklers
and  taunt  spells  from  interrupting the bard's performance.  The  material
component for this spell is a chip of granite.

      "Nuisance"  spells  are those that do no damage, but  are  designed  to
adversely affect the bard's concentration, train of thought, or senses.  Most
illusion and charm spells fall into this category, as do blindness, deafness,
and  other such spells that otherwise cause blindness or deafness. All  three
variations of the annoyance spell (q.v.) are included as well. There are more
such spells, but an exhaustive list here is unwarranted.

      When  cast,  a ray of light is emitted from the wizard's index  finger,
lasting  about a second. The colour is up to the wizard (sunlight  cannot  be
duplicated,  as  the  ray is monochromatic, like a  laser).  If  aimed  at  a
creature,  a  saving  throw versus spell is required.  If  the  saving  throw
succeeds, the ray missed. If it fails, the ray hits, inflicting no damage.

      Only a critical failure (1) can result in any ill effect. In that case,
the victim was struck in the eyes, and is dazzled for 1d6 tenths of a round (-
2  on  all rolls). Of course, if the creature in question is blind, or immune
to  such  attacks,  there  is  no  effect.  At  the  DM's  option,  creatures
particularly sensitive to light may be dazzled for a longer period  of  time.
Note:  while the spell is magical, the light generated is not, and  therefore
is not subject to magic resistance.

This  spell  is a more powerful version of Sanh's ray of light. If  a  saving
throw  versus death magic is failed, the victim suffers 1d4 points of  damage
per  level of the wizard. A fumbled saving throw results in the victim  being
permanently blinded in one eye and dazzled for 2d6 rounds (-2 on all rolls).
As  per  the  1st-level version, Sanh's improved ray of light is basically  a
laser  beam.  The  colour is chosen by the wizard, but multichromatic  light,
such as sunlight, cannot be duplicated. Since the beam itself is not magical,
magic resistance has no effect against this spell.

Sanh's laser bolt is the most powerful of Sanh's simpler light ray spells. It
inflicts  1d6  hit  points per level of the wizard. A  fumbled  saving  throw
results  in permanent blindness in one eye, followed by 1d6 rounds  of  total
blindness  and 2d6 rounds in a dazzled state. As per the earlier spells,  the
light is both monochromatic and non-magical.

When  cast,  thisspell covers a surface (usually a floor) with  an  unstable,
rapidly shifting force field, rendering it extremely slippery. Anyone  within
the  spell's  effect must roll a Dexterity check for every  action  taken  to
avoid slipping and falling. The following penalties apply:
          Standing: -1
          Walking: -3
          Running: -5
          Fighting: -9
Anyone  who falls will slide toward the edge of the area affected.  Creatures
with magic resistance roll each round to be unaffected for that round only.
The  area of effect is one 10x10 feet square per level (100 square feet), and
the  duration  is  one round. If the wizard wishes, area may  be  traded  for
duration, for instance, a 10th-level wizard may affect 1000 square feet for 1
round,  500 square feet for 2 rounds, 250 square feet for 4 rounds, etc.  The
area  affected must, however, be at least 10 square feet (that  would  be  10
square feet for 100 rounds for our 10th-level wizard).
The  surface  the spell is cast on must be relatively smooth. A wooden  floor
with  a  loose board or two, or a slightly bumpy stone surface is OK, gravel,
however,  is  not. It is also possible to cast Sanh's Slippery Surface  on  a
wall (rendering it impossible to climb on) or a ceiling.

The  material  component for this spell is a small vial of oil,  or  a  fresh
banana  peel. Using oil of slipperiness (one tenth of an ounce)  doubles  the
effect of the spell and adds an additional -1 penalty to all Dexterity rolls.
Note:  Using oil of etherealness as a material component is an invitation  to
disaster. If this is done, roll 1d100 on the following table:

     D100 Roll Effect
     01-85     Opens a rift to the ethereal plane, see below
     86-95     Spell fizzles
     96-99     Spell functions at half the wizard's level
     00   Spell functions normally

The  wizard must save versus death magic or be destroyed. All within 20  feet
of  wizard  save versus death magic or be thrown into an ether  cyclone.  The
wizard  is automatically sucked in. 20 feet diameter rift to ether lasts  1d6
turns  +  1 turn per level of wizard. There is a 1% chance per level  of  the
(very foolish) wizard that the rift will be permanent.

Sanh's  sunray is a special spell designed for use against undead  and  other
foul  creatures  of darkness. This ray exactly matches the radiation  mix  of
pure  sunlight;  it inflicts 1d4 hit points per level of the  wizard  against
living  beings,  not all that impressive at first glance.  Undead  and  other
negative  matter  creatures fare far worse, sustaining a  whopping  1d12  per
level of the wizard.
Saving  throws  are the same as per Sanh's ray of light, except  that  undead
save  at -4, and undead which are specifically harmed by sunlight suffer  the
effects  of  1 round in the sun per level of the wizard in lieu of  a  normal
damage roll (unless, of course, the normal roll would be more damaging).  For
fumbled  saving throws, the victim loses one eye, is blinded for  1d6  rounds
followed  by 2d6 rounds in a dazzled state. The reason this is so is  because
of the large amount of ultraviolet light in the ray. Since only the source of
the  light,  not the light itself is magical, magic resistance is ineffective
against this spell.

This spell duplicates a shadow's Strength drain. The wizard must roll to hit,
and if he fails to hit, he himself must save versus death magic or be drained
of  a  point  of  Strength.  This spell does not  trigger  a  negative  plane
protection,  and  it will affect creatures normally immune to  undead  energy
drains. When used against undead with energy drain abilities, the wizard must
save  versus death magic or lose twice as many energy levels as normal.  When
used against normal living victims, if the victim fails a saving throw versus
death magic, it loses a point of Strength. People drained to a 0 Strength die
and come back a day later as a free-willed shadow. The material component  of
this spell is a diamond of 20 or more gold pieces value.

      Sara's searing skean summons a sprite from the elemental plane of  fire
which is manifested on the prime material plane as a flaming aura surrounding
a  silver  dagger in the possession of the wizard. To invoke the  skean,  the
wizard  points the silver dagger at the intended target and speaks a  command
word.  The  flame  leaps  off the dagger and unerringly  strikes  the  target
indicated by the wizard. Even if the target is engaged in melee, it need only
be seen by the wizard in order for the spell to succeed.

      The attack of the skean results in damage of 2 HP + 1d3 HP per level of
wizard  to a maximum of 9d3 at ninth level. Also, flammable objects  such  as
paper or wood will be ignited by the flames, and undead receive normal damage
from  the attack. The sprite will not travel through or over water, but  does
double normal damage to creatures from the elemental plane of water which are
otherwise  "standing"  in  open  air. The dagger  does  not  harm  fire-using
creatures or creatures from the elemental plane of fire.

      After its attack, the sprite normally returns to the elemental plane of
fire,  however,  there is a 5% chance that the sprite will remain,  attacking
the nearest creature (possibly even the wizard) on the next round. The sprite
must  make this 5% roll each round it stays away from the elemental plane  of
fire,  and  for each round the sprite remains, the strength of its attack  is
reduced  by  1d3  until it dissipates. If the sprite's attack strength  falls
below  1d3, it will automatically return to the elemental plane of fire.  For
every  level  of  the  wizard's  experience  beyond  the  first  level,   the
probability of the sprite remaining is reduced by 1%.

The  material component of this spell is a silver dagger which may be reused,
and  a  pinch of sulphur which is thrown into the wind. The results  of  this
spell on planes other than the prime material plane are currently undefined.

This  powerful spell was researched by the Lord of Telnorne. It  is  actually
used  to  create  a  magical rod (3 feet long and 1 inch  in  diameter)  that
projects a continual zone of increased magical potential in a spherical  area
of  effect equal to a radius of 1 yard per level, extended outward  from  the
rod in all directions. This spherical zone makes magic function at its utmost
effectiveness, normally. But, it can be used to travel to planes with reduced
magical  factor ratings (MF) while keeping an MF rating of 0 within the  area
of  effect. On planes with an increased MF the spell simply allows all spells
of  ninth  level or less to work optimally. The zone will permeate  any  area
which  is not totally enclosed in a lead casing or protected by an anti-magic
shell which withstands the dweomer.
All  anti-magic shells or effects that come within the zone  react  as  if  a
dispel  magic  is cast upon them each and every round. Every  round  the  two
areas  interact the anti-magic zones have a chance of dispelling as though  a
wizard  of  four  levels higher than the wizard were trying to  dispel  magic
against them. On planes with a negative MF rating, everything within the area
of effect operates as though the MF rating were 0. So, someone with a ring of
flying  could  fly within the zone, but exiting it would cause them  to  drop
like  a  rock! On a negative MF rating plane, anti-magic shells are dispelled
at the normal level of mastery or the wizard and all spells cast by any class
of  characters, whether native to the plane or not, operate at  a  normal  MF
rating of 0.
The  spell's duration (from activation of the rod) is equal to a base  1  day
per  level  in a prime material plane with a MF rating of 0. On  negative  MF
rating  planes, the duration is calculate as the total number of  whole  days
left for the rod to operate divided by the result of the MF rating multiplied
by  -1.  For  example, a 20th-level wizard activates the  rod  and  hurriedly
enters a gateway to an alternate prime material plane with a MF rating of  -5
(since the spell must be initially cast on a plane with a MF rating of  0  or
better). The duration would be determined thus: 20/(-5x-1) = 4 days. But,  if
the  wizard  had operated the rod (for more than 1 turn) before entering  the
gateway  it would have lost a day's duration and be calculated as: 19/(-5x-1)
=  3.8  days  = 91.2 hours = 547.2 turns = 5,472 rounds. If the  wielder  had
travelled  to  a  plane with a MF rating greater than 0 the spell's  duration
would  be calculated as the base duration multiplied by the MF rating of  the
plane.
Whenever  the rod changes alternate prime material planes (even if they  both
contain  the  same MF rating) its duration is recalculated with  the  current
remaining  days  of  operation  left used as the  base  for  determining  the
duration of the spell (disregard any remaining duration that does not equal a
day or more in length). If the rod travels from a positive MF rating plane to
a negative MF rating plane the rod is totally disrupted in the transferral as
though  the  spell  had ended, and vice versa. Dispelling  magics  will  only
affect  the  rod for one single round unless they are cast by  a  demi-power,
lesser power, or greater power, in which case a successful dispel magic  will
cause the device to become disrupted as described below.
The  rod  is the only material component of this spell. It is made  from  the
purest mithril and rune inscribing agents (costing at least 7000 gp). Then, 9
deep blue amethysts (1000 gp each) are inset to the side of the rod among the
various runes of power, and a large sapphire (1000 gp) is affixed to the top.
Once the rod has been fashioned (2 months creation time minus 1 day per level
of  wizard  working on the inscribing of the runes down to  a  minimum  of  1
month)  this  spell  can be cast upon it, empowering the  rod  with  enormous
magical  potential. From this point, the rod remains dormant until its  power
is  activated  by  speaking thproper command word  and  willing  the  rod  to
function.  Until the rod is activated the casting wizard loses a single  9th-
level spell casting slot because of the bond that he has established with the
rod's  dormant power. While this spell could be inscribed onto  a  scroll  it
would  still  require  the rod as a material component  and  the  wizard  who
inscribed  the spell would not regain the spell slot until the  potential  of
the  scroll  was released through copying it into a spellbook or  casting  it
onto  the  rod  and activating the rod (note: an apprentice may  be  used  to
inscribe  the  runes  upon  the rod freeing the  learned  master  to  further
research).
Although  almost any sentient creature may utilise the rod, in the  hands  of
the  original wizard it will convey a personal magic resistance equal to  his
level  of experience (and cumulative to any other magic resistance he may  be
employing).  On any prime material plane the rod will also act as  a  rod  of
striking,  conveying a magical +3 to-hit bonus and striking for 3d6+3  points
of  damage  per  round. The rod may only strike once in any  melee  round  no
matter  if  the  creature  wielding it is capable of  multiple  attacks  with
weapons.  During the last turn of the spell's duration the rod will begin  to
hum  extremely loudly (hearable in a « mile radius. During the last round  of
the  spell's  duration  the  rod will glow with  extremely  powerful  magical
electricity, causing 1d20 HP of damage to all that touch it, per tenth  of  a
round  of  contact.  In  the last round is will flash  with  a  bright  light
(causing all in the zone to save versus rod, staff or wand, or be blinded for
1d20 rounds) and then cease to function. This last burst of energy transmutes
the  mithril rod into pure lead, causes the runes to dissolve, and transforms
the 10 gems into a useless powder.

This  spell allows a wizard to create a 10x10 feet invisible magical  gateway
which   will   provide  access  to  the  ethereal  plane  of  existence,   or
alternatively,  provide a gateway from the ethereal  plane  to  a  connecting
plane of existence. The duration of this gateway is a base 24 hours. It  must
be  cast in an area of gaseous or liquid composition (i.e., not in the  earth
or in solid rock), although, it may be cast so as to lay on the floor (giving
a chance of creatures falling into it) or against a wall or portal. For every
two  levels  above  sixteenth,  a  wizard gains  the  ability  to  create  an
additional  10x10  feet  area (two if the caster is a  conjurer)  which  must
either  be  used to increase the surface area of the gateway or increase  the
power  of  the original 10x10 feet area by fusing the two gateways  together.
The  effects  of increasing the power level of a gateway are  listed  in  the
table below.
If  a  gateway is larger than 10x10 feet then all of its surface area  blocks
must  be  increased to the same level of power to allow the gateway the  next
higher power rating. For example, a 26th-level wizard creates a gateway  with
dimensions  of  30x10 feet and has three slots left, so he will  be  able  to
double  the surface area power rating to 2 if he so chooses. However,  if  he
were  to  use  one of the remaining slots to add a 10x10 feet  block  to  the
surface  area  he  would have no chance of raising the power  rating  of  the
gateway  to  2.  Note that if a gateway is too small for a  creature  to  fit
through,  it  will  not be able to totally go through the  portal.  It  will,
however, be able to poke part of its body through and exist simultaneously on
both planes.

     Power
     Rating    Duration  Comments (Cumulative Effects)
     1    1 day     Visible on the exit side
     2    10 days   Invisible on exit side
     3    100 days  Allows magic items to keep powers*
     4    1000 days 10% more resistant to dispel magic
     5    10,000 days    20% more resistant to dispel magic
     6    Permanent 30% more resistant to dispel magic
     7    Permanent 40% more resistant to dispel magic
     8    Permanent (each power slot adds another 10%)

* Usually, magical swords and similar items lose a plus for plane crossing.
Each  additional power slot beyond a rating of 3 adds a 10% extra  percentage
that  this spell will resist a dispel magic. For game purposes, this is added
onto the dispeller's percentage as a penalty.
Casting  time  is one turn for the initial gateway area and is doubled  every
time another 10x10 feet block is added onto the area (i.e., two turns for two
10x10  feet blocks or slots, four turns for three 10x10 feet blocks or slots,
eight turns for four 10x10 feet blocks or slots, etc.). Therefore, casting  a
gateway  that uses 6 slots would take a total of 32 turns. If the casting  is
interrupted  after  any  slots have been created  only  further  creation  of
gateway surface areas or power slots is disrupted.
For  every  6  turns  the  wizard  spends casting  this  spell  the  wizard's
Constitution  score  is  reduced by one point. If the  wizard's  Constitution
reaches  0  he becomes unconscious and only a week of complete bed rest  will
allow  him to start regaining lost Constitution. Otherwise, these points  are
replaced  at a rate of 1 point for every two days of complete bed  rest.  The
point  is  not taken unless a full 6 turns of casting has expired. Heal  will
negate  the unconsciousness and raise the wizard's Constitution to  1  point.
Restoration will totally negate the effects of any lost Constitution.
Gateways, once created, may not be altered by further castings of this  spell
on  the  same  area of effect. Only a successful dispel magic is  capable  of
destroying a gateway, although higher level power ratings can make a  gateway
resistant to this spell. Power rating 1 gateways are visible to creatures  on
the  exit  side of the gateway (usually the ethereal plane) and  may  attract
wandering monsters, though they will most likely not be able to pass through.
Anyone  may pass through the portal on the invisible entrance side, but  only
the  wizard may freely take creatures back through the exit side by  touching
them as they pass through. The wizard may create magical amulets (base 500 gp
value)  which will allow any creature to freely use gateways cast by  him  as
though  he  were touching them. On the ethereal plane, the wizard and  anyone
possessing  an amulet will be able to find any portal of the wizard  in  5-50
hours.
Any  wizard familiar with this spell (i.e., either possessing the spell as  a
castable  spell  in his spellbook, or having used a write spell  to  put  the
spell  in his spellbook) is capable of trying to force their way through  the
exit  side back to the entrance side by force of will. There is a base chance
of 50% modified by plus or minus 5% for every point of difference between the
wizard's  current level and the level of the wizard at the time  of  casting,
though conjurers have a base 70% chance. There are no material components  to
the  spell,  and  the magical amulets may be created at any time  the  wizard
wishes,  whether before or after the casting of this spell. This  spell  will
not work with the 8th-level permanency spell.

By means of this spell, a wizard is able to cause one creature of his current
size class to enter the ethereal plane. Once there, the creature is empowered
to exit through any border ethereal curtains onto one of the elemental planes
or  the prime material plane unless it was an unwilling victim of this  spell
and  failed to make its saving throw, although a successful dispel magic cast
on  the creature (in a border ethereal curtain) will cause it to exit through
the  border ethereal. Otherwise, the creature is stuck in the ethereal  plane
until  it can find another way to transfer from the border ethereal  into  an
elemental or prime material plane.
For  every 2 levels of experience over ninth level a wizard has, he may touch
an  additional  person of his size class and transfer him into  the  ethereal
plane.  The classes are tiny, small, medium, large, huge, and gargantuan.  If
the wizard is of medium size he has each touch slot equal to 3 tiny, 2 small,
1  medium,  «  large, ¬ huge, and 1/6 gargantuan size classes. Therefore,  he
would  need  6  slots  (i.e., be a 19th-level wizard) to  send  a  gargantuan
creature into the ethereal plane.
Note  that a creature's Wisdom bonus or penalty against mind affecting spells
modifies  its savthrow when it is an unwilling recipient against  this  spell
unless it is currently voluntarily allowing another spell to be cast upon it,
in  which case it is allowed no saving throw. The material component of  this
spell  is  normally a small piece of cockatrice flesh, but almost any  animal
with sensory powers that extend into the ethereal plane will work.

This  spell  creates  a golem-like creature which the wizard  may  direct  to
perform  certain programmed actions. The creature is a temporary  fire  golem
with  no  true Intelligence and to most appears as an undead fire giant.  The
creature may be controlled up to a distance equal to the spell range  but  if
it  passes outside of this range, or the wizard is killed, the creature  will
explode in a 70-foot radius area doing damage equal to its current hit points
(save versus breath weapon for half damage). The creature created mimics most
of  the  actions of a fire giant, having AC 3, MV 12, HD 11+3, HP 58,  AT  1,
damage 5d6, special defenses: immune to fire, size: large (12 feet), Strength
22.  The  creature can fight with its sword only and has no ability  to  hurl
rocks as does a normal fire giant. It can inflict structural damage points as
a  normal fire giant on a round to round basis (wood: 2, soft stone: 1,  hard
rock: «).
The  wizard  is  able to direct the creature to perform 3 individual  actions
plus 1 for every two levels of experience above fourteenth level. Each change
in action will cause the creature to hesitate for one round before working to
act  out the next action. Actions can be classed as killing a group of  orcs,
killing  a  group of men wearing the same colours or armour, tearing  down  a
stone wall, pulling up a tree, etc.
Once the final action is completed the fire giant crumbles into a pool of hot
sulphur,  effectively making a circular area, 30 feet in  diameter,  full  of
sulphuric acid (which will kill all vegetation in the area and causing 1d3 HP
of  damage  per  round  to  any organic creature in the  area.  Against  mind
affecting  spells,  the creature is considered to have  an  Intelligence  and
Wisdom  of 3 (saving at -3 versus these attacks). If the creature is  charmed
or  controlled by a mind affecting spell the wizards concentration is totally
disrupted  causing the creature to dissipate and any other spells the  wizard
currently  controls will become dispelled unless the wizard  has  no  control
over  the spells in question after casting them, and any spell the wizard  is
currently casting willbe disrupted.
This  spell  requires  only the slightest mental control  of  the  wizard  to
operate,  allowing him to cast other spells normally that do not require  his
full concentration. Multiple castings of this spell will work, but all of the
detrimental effects are cumulative. The material component of this spell is a
small  pouch (2 inches squared) of leather containing a patch of  fresh  (not
dried)  fire giant hair mixed with ruby dust of no less than 1000  gp  value.
The  fire  giant  hair  may be kept fresh with a preserve  spell  or  similar
effect.

This  spell  creates  a golem-like creature which the wizard  may  direct  to
perform  certain  programmed actions. The creature is a temporary  ice  golem
with no true Intelligence, and to most appears as an undead frost giant.  The
creature may be controlled up to a distance equal to the spell range  but  if
it  passes outside of this range, or the wizard is killed, the creature  will
explode in a 60-foot radius area doing damage equal to its current hit points
(save versus breath weapon for half damage). The creature created mimics most
of  the actions of a frost giant, having AC 4, MV 12, HD 10+2, HP 52,  AT  1,
damage  4d6,  special defenses: immune to cold, size: L (15 feet),  Strength:
21.  The  creature can fight with its club only and has no  ability  to  hurl
rocks as a normal frost giant. It can inflict structural damage points  as  a
normal  frost giant on a round to round basis (wood: 2, soft stone:  1,  hard
rock: «).
The  wizard  is  able to direct the creature to perform 3 individual  actions

This  spell  creates golden, shimmering circular plates of force  which  move
around  the  wizard  in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,  hand,  or
weapon  attacks  directed at the wizard. The Armour Class of  the  wizard  is
improved  by  a  factor  of 1 for every three circles still  active  and  any
successful  physical melee attack (other than boulders, ballista,  or  attack
forms   similar  to  a  dragon's  belly-flop  manoeuvre)  will  be  deflected
automatically. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective Strength of
21 or greater require a saving throw versus breath weapons to deflect.
Each circle is able to sustain 6 points of damage before being disrupted,  so
if  a  deflected  attack does not cause enough damage  to  disrupt  a  circle
(chosen  randomly)  the  circle will remain active. For  every  five  circles
active,  the effects of breath weapons directed at the wizard will be reduced
by  1  HP  per  damage die, with 1 HP per level being the  maximum  reduction
allowable. But, unless the breath weapon causes less damage than the  current
hit points of a circle, it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of circles
in the process.
While  the  circles orbit the wizard he is at a -1 to-hit penalty  for  every
circle  active whenever a to-hit roll is needed, including spells. The wizard
may create fewer circles than the maximum possible. The material component of
this  spell  is a single gold piece for every circle created. All pieces  are
thrown  into  the air where they disappear and are replaced by  the  floating
circles.

This  spell  creates  golden, shimmering square plates of  force  which  move
around the wizard in a constant motion, attempting to deflect missile,  hand,
or  weapon attacks directed at the wizard. The Armour Class of the wizard  is
not  altered  by  the spell, but any successful physical attack  (other  than
boulders,  ballista,  or attacks similar to a dragon's belly-flop  manoeuvre)
will be deflected if the wizard successfully saves versus breath weapons. Non-
missile  attacks  by creatures with an effective Strength of  19  or  greater
require a saving throw versus spell to deflect.
Each  plate is able to sustain 4 points of damage before disrupting, so if  a
deflected  attack  does not cause enough damage to disrupt a  square  (chosen
randomly)  the  square will remain active. For every 5  squares  active,  the
effects of breath weapons directed at the wizard will be reduced by 1 HP  per
damage  die,  with  1  point of damage per die being  the  maximum  reduction
allowable.  However,  unless the breath weapon causes less  damage  than  the
current hit points of a square it will assuredly disrupt the entire field  of
squares in the process.
While  the  squares orbit the wizard he is at a -1 to-hit penalty  for  every
square  active whenever a to-hit roll is needed, including spells. The wizard
may create fewer squares than the maximum possible. The material component of
this  spell  is a single gold piece for every square created. All pieces  are

This spell creates golden, shimmering, star-shaped plates of force which move
around  the  wizard  in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,  hand,  or
weapon  attacks  directed at the wizard. The Armour Class of  the  wizard  is
improved  by  a  factor  of  1 for every three stars  still  active  and  any
successful  physical  melee attack (including boulders, ballista,  or  attack
forms  similar  to  a  dragon's  belly  flop  manoeuvre)  will  be  deflected
automatically. Creatures of size L (or larger) who are deflected  must  still
land  somewhere,  possibly  injuring friend or foe.  Non-missile  attacks  by
creatures  with  an  effective Strength of 25 require a saving  throw  versus
breath weapon to deflect.
Each  star  is  able to sustain 10 HP of damage before disrupting,  so  if  a
deflected  attack  does  not cause enough damage to disrupt  a  star  (chosen
randomly) the star will remain active. For every 5 stars active, the  effects
of  breath weapons directed at the wizard will be reduced by 1 HP per  damage
die,  with  total  protection  from breath attacks  becoming  a  possibility,
though,  unless  the breath weapon causes less damage than  the  current  hit
points  of a star it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of stars in  the
process.
While the stars orbit the wizard he is at a -1 to-hit penalty for every  star
active  whenever a to-hit roll is needed, including spells.  The  wizard  may
create fewer stars than the maximum possible. Also, the wizard may choose  to
release  up  to three stars per round at up to three different  opponents  no
farther  away from the wizard than 5 yards per level and who are in his  line
of  sight.  Released  stars act and attack as magic missiles  and  should  be
considered  triple strength versions of a normal magic missile for  defensive
considerations.  A star (chosen randomly from the remaining  stars)  will  do
damage equal to its current hit points. The material component of this  spell
is  a  single gold piece for every five-pointed star created. All pieces  are
thrown  into  the air where they disappear and are replaced by  the  floating
stars.

This  spell creates golden, shimmering triangular plates of force which  move
around  the  wizard  in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,  hand,  or
weapon  attacks  directed at the wizard. The Armour Class of  the  wizard  is
improved  by  one for every three triangles still active and  any  successful
physical melee attack (including boulders, ballista, or attack forms  similar

creatures  of  large-size  (or  higher) who are  deflected  must  still  land
somewhere, possibly injuring friend or foe. Non-missile attacks by  creatures
with  an  effective Strength of 23 or greater require a saving  throw  versus
breath weapons to deflect.
Each triangle is able to sustain 8 hit points of damage before disrupting, so
if  a  deflected  attack does not cause enough damage to disrupt  a  triangle
(chosen  randomly)  the triangle will remain active. For  every  5  triangles
active,  the effects of breath weapons directed at the wizard will be reduced
by  1  hit  point  per damagedie, with total protection from  breath  attacks
becoming  a possibility, though, unless the breath weapon causes less  damage
than  the  current  hit  points of a triangle it will assuredly  disrupt  the
entire field of triangles in the process.
While  the triangles orbit the wizard he is at a -1 to-hit penalty for  every
triangle  active  whenever  a to-hit roll is needed,  including  spells.  The
wizard  may  create fewer triangles than the maximum possible.  The  material
component  of  this spell is a single gold piece for every triangle  created.
All  pieces are thrown into the air where they disappear and are replaced  by
the floating triangles.

This  spell is used to create a magical amulet which, when worn or  possessed
by  a  creature, will cause all spells cast by the amulet's creator to affect
the  creature with different variables of power. All defensive or  beneficial
spells  will  have  a +2 (on any applicable die or 10% if a  percentage  die)
bonus  applied  to  durations, areas of effect, ranges, or any  increases  in
which  the bonus would benefit the creature. All attack or detrimental spells
from  the  wizard  would apply with a -2 (or -10%) penalty applied  to  their
operation  against  the  creature. For example, if  the  wizard  accidentally
caught an ally (in possession of his mage ward) in the area of effect of  his
fireball, the creature would have his needed saving throw reduced  by  2  and
all  damage  dice  against the creature would suffer a -2  penalty,  possibly
negating the effect on that creature.
Also,  having  the amulet in their possession (knowingly or unknowingly,  but
not  forcibly  against  their will) a creature's base magic  resistance  will
automatically be reduced by 2% per level of the wizard (at the  time  of  the
ward's  creation).  Possession is considered to be within  2  inches  of  the
creature's body.
The  amulet  may  also  be used to negate any portal  or  device  protections
created  or cast by the wizard for a one round period. After 10 uses of  this
nature  the amulet crumbles to dust. The material component of this spell  is
10  gp  weight  of platinum, and a special mould made of wax  and  a  crushed
sapphire worth at least 500 gp. Once molten, the platinum is poured into  the
mould  and then the spell is cast on the cooling metal. Note that the  amulet
does  not  have  to  be any certain shape, and can later have  gems  (whether
magical or not) mounted into it through shaping or settings made at the  time
of moulding, but the amulet must not be injured by this or 1d6 of the charges
will be used.

This  spell  brings  a magical force field into existence which  resembles  a
dimly  glowing  platform made of glass-like material.  The  glowing  platform
(dimly visible up to 5 feet away in daylight) is capable of flying under  the
control  of the wizard, who may carry himself and a certain amount of  weight
through  airy  and watery mediums. When casting this spell,  the  wizard  may
choose to create a 10x10 feet platform with 6-inch sidewalls or a 40x40  feet
platform  with 3-inch sidewalls. The 10x10 feet platform loses  some  of  the
abilities of the 40x40 feet one, but is 10% magic resistant and confers a  5%
magic  resistance  to anything in physical contact with  the  platform.  Both
platforms  have a localised gravity that aids in keeping materials  on  board
and  bonuses to Dexterity checks for falling from it. The differences between
platforms and general flight powers are listed in the table below. Note  that
this  spell  uses  the  Intelligence of the creature  casting  the  spell  to
determine  usage (even thieves) and creatures with less than a 9 Intelligence
may  not  effectively use this spell. Only wizards may create the 10x10  feet
platform.
The  platforms may only be destroyed by magical damage. Physical attacks,  no
matter how strong, will only be able to move the platform in relation to  the
force  of  the  attack compared to the current speed or  lift  rate.  Magical
weapons will do damage equal to their magical plusses only. If area of effect
attacks come from below that do not destroy the platform they will not affect
the  contents of the platform. Note that, even if the magic resistance  of  a
10x10  feet  platform is bridged, it fails its saving throw, and  takes  full
damage,  unless  it is destroyed the aforementioned effect  holds  true.  The
magic resistance passed onto objects touching the platform stay in effect for
one  round  after  it  is  destroyed. Breath weapons are  considered  magical
attacks  cast  at  the  level of the Hit Dice of the breathing  creature  for
determining magic resistance breach.
The  40x40  feet  platform  may sustain 3 HP per  level  of  the  originating
experience  level  at which it was cast, while the 10x10 feet  platform  will
take  4  times this amount of damage. The platform is immune to  any  attacks
which  use a primal force of the plane in which it is created (eg.,  fire  in
the  elemental  plane of fire) since it is created from  the  forces  of  the
current  plane  in  which it resides. This also prevents  the  platform  from
crossing  planar  boundaries. In places where there is no localised  gravity,
movement  rates  are  double  the stated values in  the  table  below.  Spell
duration in normal time is 1 turn per level for the 10x10 feet platform and 1
day  per  level for the 40x40 feet platform. The material component  of  this
spell  is a platinum plate (3x5x« inch) with mystic runes etched into  it.  A
jeweller is needed (unless the character has the skill) and he will charge no
less  than  500 gp to work the runes needed into the plate, the  total  price
coming to 4000 gp for the plate. The wizard must use a wizard mark of his own
to  prepare  the  plate  or it will only be able to  create  the  40x40  feet
platform.

Max.  Speed: This is measured in feet per round indoors and yards  per  round
outdoors.  Incapacitating  the  controlling person  causes  the  platform  to
freeze.  Speed also directly converts to miles per hour when the platform  is
flown for that amount of time.
Max. Weight: This is measured in pounds.
Max.  (Rate of) Lift: For every 100 pounds over the maximum weight limit  the
lift  rate is reduced by 1 per round. Negative lift rates cause the  platform
to  go  down at a rate equal to the negative rating unless the current  plane
has no gravity. In this case movement rate is affected vice lift.
Manoeuvr. Class: This is the platform's manoeuvrability class.
Falling  Adjustm.:  This  bonus is doubled for  the  wizard  controlling  the
platform.  Each  +1 should be considered a pull each to one tenth  of  normal
gravity  in  the  current plane of existence. These plusses are  specifically
bonuses against falling off of the platform.

This spell uses the magical forces of the astral or ethereal planes to create
a  small demi-plane. This demi-plane is connected to the current plane of the
wizard  through  a  special (10x10 feet) gateway which is  invisible  to  all
creatures  except  the wizard unless they are able to use true  seeing.  When
cast, this spell causes astral or ethereal stone to form into a 10-foot cube.
This  cube houses the physical structure of the demi-plane, but the  interior
is a distorted dimensional area with a volume equal to 10 cubic feet of space
per  level  of  the  wizard. In its drab, grey interior,  the  demi-plane  is
governed by the physical and magical laws of the plane in which it is created
(astral  or ethereal), but does have a localised gravity which is  under  the
control  of the wizard (normally equal to what the wizard is used to  at  the
prime  material plane but it may be lowered all the way to 0 G at a  rate  of
0.1 G per round).
There  is no need for air or nutrition since characters are governed  by  the
normal astral or ethereal laws. The wizard may change the interior form,  but
may  not  decrease or increase the volume of the demi-plane. Volume  form  is
changed  in  10  foot cubic blocks, and it is impossible  to  make  any  area
smaller  than  10  cubic  feet, though, pits and  similar  obstacles  can  be
created.  Also,  the  normal  temperature in the  demi-plane  is  68  degrees
Fahrenheit and may not be changed.
A  wizard must touch someone for them to see and enter the gateway, but, once
inside, anyone may freely exit the demi-plane. If someone is able to see  the
gateway through the use of true seeing, and he is a wizard familiar with  the
wizard  lock  or  temporal demi-plane spells, he may  attempt  to  enter  the
gateway  by  using his willpower to negate the need for the casting  wizard's
touch. In game terms this means a successful percentile roll with a base  50%
chance  modified  plus or minus 5% for every difference  in  level  from  the
wizard  in  an upward or downward progression, respectively. A wizard  seeing
the gateway and meeting the stated prerequisites will automatically know that
this  is possible. Otherwise, only spells of a wish-like nature will be  able
to  discern the entrance, though creatures with senses that extend  into  the
astral  or ethereal planes will be able to see the large block of stone  that
makes  up  the external surface of the demi-plane area and psionic characters
may be able to use probability travel to gate into the demi-plane if they are
familiar with it.
The  demi-plane does not allow access to the astral or ethereal planes unless
it  is  destroyed, or if the wizard creates the demi-plane while  on  one  of
these  planes,  in  which  case the entrance to the  demi-plane  is  actually
entered  on  the  plane  in which it resides and not a  connecting  outer  or
elemental  plane.  When  the  spell is initially memorised  the  wizard  must
determine whether he will cast the astral or ethereal variant of this  spell.
It is impossible for both to be used in the same area of effect (on the prime
material plane) due to conjugations of magic energies required in maintaining
the spell.
The  structure  containing  the demi-plane is  able  to  withstand  3  HP  of
structural  damage (versus hard stone) before it is disrupted.  The  ethereal
cyclone will inflict 1d100 HP of structural damage every time it passes  over
the  area  of  the  demi-plane and the psychic  winds  of  the  astral  plane
automatically inflict damage equal to half the current structural hit  points
of  the demi-plane's shell. The nature of the demi-plane causes it to stay in
one spot so it may be used as a reference point if the spell duration is long
enough  (through the possible use of a permanency type spell). But, no matter
what  spells are applied to the demi-plane, it will always disrupt  when  its
structural  hit points are brought to 0 or less. The contents  of  the  demi-
plane are then thrown into the plane of creation and all creatures must  save
versus  spell at -6 or be knocked unconscious for a period of time  equal  to
one  hour of time on the plane in question (not subjective time). If cast  on
the  ethereal plane the spell duration is extended by a factor 10 and on  the
astral  plane  the  duration  is extended by  a  factor  1000.  The  material
component  of  this  spell  is a miniature platinum  ziggurat  embedded  with
peridots  and having a finished value of at least 1000 gp. The ziggurat  must
weigh at least 5 ounces.

This  enables the caster to re-memorise a spell of higher or lower level.  He
may  exchange  multiple lower level spells for one higher  level  spell.  The
total number of spell levels of the lower spells must exceed the level of the
spell  re-memorised by at least 2 levels. Alternatively, he may exchange  one
higher  level  spell for one other spell, which must be at least  two  levels
lower.  Schmuk's  spell  exchange must be cast in the morning,  before  other
spells are being memorised. The material component for this spell is a golden
balance, worth at least 5,000 gp.

For  this spell to work, the wizard must cast it when he believes that he  is
being  watched  through  the use of spells or magical scrying  devices  (ESP,
crystal ball, or wizard eye, for example). Immediately after the wizard being
scried  casts this one-word spell, the scryer may suffer one or more  of  the
following effects (roll separate percentile dice for each):
          80% chance of being affected as if by the spell forget;
          55% chance of taking 2d4 HP of damage from the backlash;
          10% chance of falling into a coma lasting 1d20 days; and
          5% chance of being feebleminded, as the spell.
All  spell-like effects are at the level of the caster of the  scrybane.  The
scryer  must  make  separate  saving throws to  avoid  each  of  the  effects
befalling  him. The material components for this spell are a dark translucent
stone worth at least 500 gold pieces, and a small flame.
Scrybane  is  one  of many powerful anti-divinatory spells. Any  wise  wizard
should somehow acquire one before beginning magical research of his own.

This  spell  is in all respects the same as the 1st-level light, except  that
only the wizard can see the light. This of course means that it can in no way
be used as an attack (blinding people, harming certain undead, etc.). It will
cancel  magical darkness, as it is cancelled by magical darkness,  just  like
light.  The material components are the same as for Light plus two  drops  of
blood and a tear from the wizard.
The  spell  can be reversed to secret darkness, although this normally  isn't
very useful. Perhaps if in presence of a blinding light you could cast secret
darkness  at  the light source, so that you wouldn't be blinded.  Of  course,
you'd  better  have another source of illumination handy. Also,  it  wouldn't
save  a  vampire  from the effects of direct sunlight - the  light  is  still
hitting his body, he just can't see it.

This spell lights one or more ordinary torches. The flames will, however,  be
cold  and  dark,  shedding no ordinary light. The wielder of the  torch  will
however be able to see by the torch, as if it was an ordinary torch, as  long
as  he  has it in his hand. Only one person can benefit from the torch  at  a
given time: if two or more persons touch it, no-one will benefit. The wielder
must  hold it in his bare hand if he wants to see by it, and the flames  will
seem  warm to him. The torch can be put aside or handed over, as an  ordinary
torch  would  be, but cannot set fire to anything. It can be extinguished  by
any  normal  means, for example water or very strong winds.  The  torch  will
slowly smoulder and burn out, as an ordinary torch would.

The material components are the torches to be lit, and a small portion of oil
with  rare herbs, which the torches are rubbed with (3 gp worth of herbs  per
torch). In addition, the wizard must have access to a source of fire.

     This spell creates a standing order with one or more undead to engage in
sexual behaviour of the caster's choice with the caster. The undead will make
no effort to harm the caster, although disease from a zombie's touch or mummy
rot,  for  example, may of course occur. Each orgasm achieved by  the  caster
causes  1d6 damage to the undead. The material component is a drop  of  semen

The  wizard  may affect one individual of the opposite sexual orientation  to
become  enamoured with the wizard and willingly subject to  all  his  or  her
commands. That the victim has been seduced (magically or otherwise)  will  be
readily  apparent to all on a Wisdom check. In order to cast the  spell,  the
enchanter  must extract a personal item of the victim's, and  then  cast  the
spell  onto  the item in solitude. When the item is given back to the  victim
and recognized, the spell is complete. The victim is allowed a special saving
throw on a 1d20 based his highest class.

The  roll is modified by adding the victim's Wisdom and level and subtracting
the  wizard's  apparent  Comeliness  and  enchantment  level.  The  spell  is
effective until dispelled. While under the enchantment, the victim will  take
as  gospel everything the enchanter says, and will strive to protect  adefend
the  wizard at all times. If the spell is broken by another magic or  by  the
will  of the enchanter, however, the victim will remember everything and know
that magic was involved. The material component for this spell is a flask  of
perfume or after-shave that must be shattered.

      The  psionicist can see the heat radiated from  objects.  If
this  is the type of infravision used in your campaign, treat this
as  normal infravision.  Otherwise, the psionicist can see heat at
any  distance, although at long distances he will be able  to  see
only very hot things, and will probably only see them as small red
dots.  Small details cannot be seen using this power, although  it
might reveal things not normally seen in normal light.

Power  Score:   The  psionicist also gains ultravision  (cf.  Feel
Radiation).

      With  this  power the psionicist can see magical radiations.
This  is  quite difficult, and he requires a new power check  each
round. Stronger magic is easier to see, so the level of the  magic
is  added  to  the  power  check. To see a  9th  level  spell  the
psionicist  must  roll Int +1, for example. Artifacts  and  relics
radiate  magic so strongly that no roll is needed after the  first
power  check  at  Int  +1. Monsters with a  strong  connection  to
magical  powers can also be detected by rolling Int -12.  One  die
roll  is  made per round, and the result determines which  objects
are seen.
      When  using  this power, a psionicist can see a  faint  glow
around the object or in the area being affected. The stronger  the
magic,  the stronger the glow.  This glow can be seen even in  the
dark,  but it does not illuminate anything. A darkness spell  will
be  seen  as low magical radiation, but nothing inside the magical
darkness will be seen.

Power  Score:  The colour of the radiation depends upon the school
of magic.

20:  The psionicist cannot use this power again that day.

This spell allows the recipient to partially see through the various darkness
spells.  Clear sight is not gained, but outlines and shades of  light  versus
dark  are  noted.  Combat is possible at 2 less on the penalties  for  normal
darkness  ( 2 for normal creatures, no penalty for those with blind fighting,
and  ranged attacks are allowed). This spell does not counter the effects  of
natural  darkness (i.e.: nighttime) but can be used against magical  darkness
effects  other than those of spell origin (eg., some creatures can  magically
generate darkness). The material component is a piece of phosphorus.

This  spell  causes one tree seed or seedling per level of the priest  to  be
specially blessed by the priest's god. When the spell is cast upon a seed  or
seedling and planted in the ground, it will immediately start to grow  at  an
astonishing rate. It will grow to a total height of 2 feet + 1 foot per level
of  the priest in the period of one turn. A tree thus "blessed" by this spell
will grow to be a large, healthy tree, highly resistant to both parasites and
disease,  and  will have a much longer lifespan than ordinary  trees  of  its
type.
The  reverse  of this spell, tree shrink, causes one tree to  be  reduced  in
height  by the above amount. If this is cast upon an enchanted or intelligent
tree,  it  gets a saving throw versus spell. If the tree saves, there  is  no
effect. If the tree fails, then the tree is reduced in Hit Dice by the  level
of the priest.
The  spell can be cast in two ways. The first way takes 1 round per  seed  or
seedling  to  cast and be planted. The other way takes 1 round  per  seed  or
seedling  to cast, initially. The spell is then finished at a later  time  by
completing  the  final  gestures (again, this  costs  1  round  per  seed  or
seedling) and then planting the seeds or seedlings. There is no limit to  the
time  in  between  the  original casting and completion  in  this  variation.
Anybody can perform the final gestures needed to complete this spell.
The  seeds  or  seedlings are most commonly used for gifts  or  reforestation
projects as needed. The trees around a priest grove tend to be of this type.

When  cast,  this spell (also known by its nickname super spasm)  causes  the
victim to lose complete control over all muscles in his body for the duration
of the spell. This causes the victim to "spas out": fall down and flip around
like  a  fish out of water. There is a quirk to this spell: any creature  not
possessing  a  central nervous system is not affected by this spell.  In  all
other aspects this spell is the same as spasm. The material component of  the
spell is psehaw-monkey blood.

As  a  preserver  is  avidly against defiling, the typical  preserver,  after
sufficient  experience, will realize what causes defiling, and why  preserver
spells don't defile. As such, he can learn to use this knowledge for his  own
good.
This  spell  may emulate any cantrip-like effect, the energy  for  the  spell
being  drained from a specific plant source. The spell can be  used  for  two
specific purposes - any other use is strictly prohibited to one who wishes to
preserve the land.
           To  kill  a  carnivorous plant that is a threat.  Because  of  the
selective  nature, the preserver can drain the plant's life without affecting
the non-hostile plants around it, and will thus leave the soil nutrient rich.
          To neutralize organic poisons. Organic poisons, since they are made
from  the  basic elements of life, are also affected by defiling spells,  but
only  if specifically targeted. Note that with this use, another spell effect
should not be allowed.
Any  other  use  of this spell condemns the wizard to the penalties  normally
associated with a preserver casting a defiling spell.

This  spell can be used to duplicate the disintegration spell with the  added
effect  of  making  only selected parts disinte- if they  fail  their  saving
throw.  The  selected parts can be as specific or as general  as  the  caster
desires, but it takes additional casting time to select the specified  parts.
For every ten words (don't count a and the as words) in the specification  an
additional modifier is added to the casting time until a casting time of  ten
is  reached (at twenty words). This is changed into a one round casting time,
unless even that is not enough to specify all different parts. If the objects
to  be  disintegrated are carried by a person that person gets a saving throw
first.  If he fails, then the items get a saving throw versus disintegration.
If the specified objects fail, they are gone completely.
Note  that this spell has a duration. This duration is the time during  which
the  specified objects (or creatures) can be disintegrated if they enter  the
cubic  area of effect. They have to make a saving throw for every round  they
are  in  this  area.  Thus,  this spell could  be  placed  on  a  doorway  to
disintegrate all living things passing through that don't display  a  certain
sign.  If  the  specification can be circumvented then nothing  happens.  The
duration  does  not include those items or creatures affected by  the  spell:
once they are disintegrated they stay disintegrated.

In  addition  to simulating the effects of the 3rd-level dispel magic  spell,
the  caster may choose freely whatever is to be affected by the dispel  magic
spell  and  what is not affected by it. The caster may choose the schools  of
magic  to  be  affected,  the sphere (if used against priest  spells),  which
persons,  objects, or spells in the area of effect, whether his own magic  is
affected by it or not, etc. There may be many more possibilities what can  be
chosen  to  be affected. It is even possible to say that only a single  spell
among  several  is  supposed to be dispelled on one  person.  The  method  of
determining whether the dispelling attempt was successful or not is the  same
as in the 3rd-level spell.

This spell is very similar to the 1st-level priest spell entangle except that
it  affects only the creatures targeted by the spell and no-one else,  unlike
entangle.
When the creatures that are affected by this spell try to walk by any form of
plant life, the plants will reach out and grab the creatures much in the same
manner  as  with entangle. Thus, while they are trapped by the spell,  others
can  then  walk up to the entangled creatures. In this respect, the spell  is
similar to hold person in its effects.
If  the creatures fail their saving throw versus spell, they are held fast by
the  plants. If the saving throw is made, the targeted creatures  have  their
movement reduced to half normal.
If  the  creatures  struggle to free themselves from the plants  then  a  new
saving throw versus spell can be made every turn (note: this is very tiring).
The  to-hit  bonus  can be used as a positive modifier for  these  additional
saving  throws. If the creatures make one of these additional saving  throws,
they are freed, but their movement is still reduced by half. If after another
turn  the creatures are still in an area with plant life then a saving  throw
versus spell is required with the effects outlined above occurring. In short,
a  saving  throw  must  be  made every turn when in areas  of  vegetation  to
determine  the effects of the spell if the spell target is actively  fighting
the effects of the spell.
The material component for this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This spell has almost the same effect as a Mordenkainen's disjunction, but it
functions  only on one lone object (not carried by a person)  or  one  person
(and up to one object per level). The caster can choose whether to affect the
whole  person or only one or more objects carried by the person.  If  objects
are to be affected, the caster has to be able to recognise them for what they
are:  a  ring  of  fire  resistance, a pair of bracers  of  defence,  +2,  or
something likewise. If the object is not what the caster believes it  to  be,
he  just reduces the part that he believes the item to be - if the item fails
two  saving  throws:  the first saving throw is the normal  saving  throw  as
described  within the ordinary disjunction spell; the second is an additional
saving throw at double the level of the item as it was not what was tried  to
be  disjoined.  Any  spells  are  completely disjoined  as  in  the  ordinary
disjunction.  If a lone object (not carried by a person) is to be  disjoined,
it  only gets the normal saving throw, even if the caster does not know  what
its purpose is. What is actually disjoined and what remains is determined  in
the same way as in the normal 9th-level spell.

The  material component is the trunk of a disenchanter which is embalmed with
the  oils from a hazelnut tree from a magic dead area and lined in linen made
from plants from a different magic dead area.

This  spell  combines  the effects of the 4th-level priest  spell  neutralize
poison  and  the  2nd-level priest spell slow poison. The  spell  will  first
revive,  then neutralize the poison in any individual upon which it is  cast.
It  will  bring  back a supposedly dead individual if cast  upon  the  victim
within a number of turns less than or equal to the level of experience of the
priest  after the poisoning was suffered (cf. slow poison). Neither a  system
shock  nor  a resurrection roll is needed for a victim brought back  in  this
manner and it does not count as a death for purposes of Constitution loss.
The  reversed  spell, Selene's improved poison, requires a successful  attack
roll  in combat, and the victim is also allowed a saving throw versus poison,
but at a  1 penalty per 3 levels of the priest. Failure indicates death.
The material component of this spell is the cleric's holy symbol.

This spell is a less potent version of the 7th-level priest spell regenerate.
The  spell  will allow the priest to reattach a severed limb to an individual
provided the limb is present and the spell is cast not more than 1 turn per 3
levels  of the priest after the limb was severed. The process of reattachment
takes but 1 round, but the limb is not usable for any purpose until after the
victim  has rested for 1 day. No system shock or resurrection roll is  needed
for limb reattachment. If cast upon a creature that has had its head severed,
the  spell allows the head to be reattached, but does not in itself  bring  a
dead  victim  back to life. The reattachment of the head does, however  allow
the  victim to be raised, instead of resurrected. There is no time limit  for
reattaching heads to dead bodies, other than that imposed by a raise dead  or
resurrection spell.
The  reverse of this spell, Selene's detachment, requires a successful attack
roll,  and  further  allows a saving throw versus death magic  to  avoid  its
effects.  Failure indicates that a random limb (but not the head) is detached
with  the  appropriate  penalties  to hit  points,  movement,  Armour  Class,
attacks,  etc.  (cf. sword of sharpness). Unlike the 7th-level  priest  spell
wither (the reverse of regenerate), the limb does not turn to dust but  falls
off.  Creatures making their saving throws still take damage equal to a cause
critical  wounds, i.e. 3d8+3. Selene's detachment has no effect on  nonliving
creatures  (undead, constructs, etc.) or on creatures from other planes  (cf.
cure light wounds).

This  power, the converse of conjure, lets the psionicist send  an
object  from  his  current  location  to  another  location.   The
destination  must be one that the character knows and can  picture
in his mind, or one that he can see, by whatever means.
      The object, which can weigh up to 50 pounds, must be carried
or firmly grasped by the psionicist. He cannot send an object that
bears  a wizard mark unless the mark is his own. If the object  is
also  grasped  by  another creature, the psionicist  must  wage  a
psychic contest, pitting his Sending power score against the other
creature's Strength score. If the object is anchored to  something
weighing  over 50 pounds (such as a locked door in a castle),  the
object cannot be sent. If the object has intelligence, bestowed by
either magical or psionic means, it may opt to resist the sending,
forcing  the  psionicist  to wage a psychic  contest  against  the
object's Intelligence.  Only nonliving objects can be affected  by
a sending.
      The  difficulty of the sending increases with the weight  of
the object and the distance to the destination, as detailed in the
table in the listing for Conjure.
     Note: The 0 (1d4) preparation time denotes a preparation time
of 1d4 segments.

Power Score:  The initial cost is reduced by 20% (rounded up), and
there are no penalties for the object's weight.

20:   The object is sent, but not to the location desired  by  the
psionicist.  The item may be teleported mere away feet  from  him,
or it could arrive miles away from where it was supposed to.

     This devotion discovers emanations of evil from any creature,
object,  or  area. Character alignment, however, is revealed  only
under  unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned,
who  do  not stray from their faith, and who are of at  least  9th
level  might  radiate  evil  if intent upon  appropriate  actions.
Powerful monsters such as rakshasas send forth emanations of evil,
even  if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is  this
power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An
evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil.
      The  degree  of evil (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming)
and  possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant,  gloating,
etc.) can be noted.
      The  devotion has a path of detection 10 feet  wide  in  the
direction in which the psionicist is facing. The range depends  on
the degree of evil and usually varies between 30 and 500 yards.

Power Score:  The psionicist can also sense goodness in a creature
in the same degrees.

20:   The  psionicist's  aura takes on that  of  a  powerful  evil
creature.

object already possesses in such a way that those opposed to the caster  gain
absolutely  no  magical  effect from the item  whatsoever.  There  is  a  90%

This  spell  concentrates all the power of a death spell  on  one  victim.  A
saving throw versus death magic is allowed. For every three levels the wizard
exceeds the victim's level or Hit Dice, a -1 penalty is applied to the saving
throw,  and  vice versa. If the saving throw is failed, the victim  is  slain
immediately.  If it succeeds, he is weakened for one turn per  level  of  the
wizard,  suffering a -2 penalty to all rolls. This penalty is  cumulative.  A
saving  throw  which succeeds by more than 10, or is critically made  negates
any and all effects of that casting of the spell.

The  material  component is a black pearl, and the lens from  the  eye  of  a
catoblepas, costing a total of 1000 gp. Note: in some places, the lens may be
hard  to  get, as its only known use (besides as a lens) is for death-dealing
spells and poisons.

The  priest initiates the spell by lifting his head, putting his hands in the
air  and  howling.  This howling causes all those in a  60-foot  cube  to  be
affected.  Those affected must make a saving throw versus spell  or  flee  in
terror  for  the  duration of the spell (those who have seen  or  heard  this
before save at +2). This spell will also draw any hounds and wolves in  a  1-
mile  radius  to  the priest. The hounds and wolves will be friendly  to  the
priest but communication is not guaranteed. Those who are deaf are immune  to
this spell.

This  spell operates as a shades spell producing a 60% real duplicate of  the
creature  touched  as  a  shades  would.  If  the  original  creature  is   a
spellcaster,  the  60%  applies to the shadow's  effective  level  for  spell
selection. Note that all of the shadow's spell effects are illusions.
The  shadow creature is formed from the shadow cast by the original and  will
be  completely under the control of the original creature through an ESP-like
link.  The shadow creature appears to have all the natural abilities  of  the
original. Many of these shadow abilities will be illusionary.
No  material component is required but the creature must be lit to produce  a
shadow  for  the  spell to work. For the duration of the spell  the  original
creature  will not cast a shadow, the spell is sometimes cast just  for  this
particular side effect. The semi-real shadow form produced by the spell  will
cast  a  shadow and can be used to create a further duplicate, the 60% factor
applies again, with another application of the spell.

The most powerful in a time spirit's repertoire, this spell opens all of time
to  the  caster. Once this spell is cast, a time spirit may time-walk as  far
into  the  past  as he desires, in any time stream, and affect  any  and  all
events.  He  may meet his past self (even kill his past self), and  basically
wreak  all  kinds of havoc without risk of changing his past experiences,  or
those  of any other being subjected to the spell, since he now exists outside
of  time.  The use of this spell has a 99% chance of attracting the attention
of time guardians   and none-too-pleased ones at that.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for
more information on this class.

This spell causes the victim's sex to change. Thus, a male becomes female and
vice-versa.
The  wizard can choose to change either only the target's sex, or  to  change
the  target's sex and entire body, as if the target was born the new sex. The
target's  clothes may, also at the wizard's option, change  to  fit  it.  The
change  takes 1 round; to dispel the spell, Dispel Magic must be cast  during
this period.
At  the wizard's option, the target may be made to actually think and act  as
though it was the new sex. The chances of this are the same as for assumption
of a new form's personality when polymorphed (q.v.): if a d20 roll, made each
day,  is less than or equal to 20 minus the target's Intelligence, the target
no  longer wishes to return to its own sex and finds it natural to act as its
new sex.

The material component for this spell is a golden ring.

This spell causes the victim's sex to change. Thus, a male becomes female and
vice  versa.  A  saving  throw versus spell negates the  effects.  After  the
change,  the victim will be confused for 1d10 turns. Also, he (or  she)  will
have a percent chance equal to his (her) Constitution of going insane because
of the trauma.
The  DM must make sure the victim of the spell acts in the manner appropriate
to the sex. If not, then the spell doesn't really seem powerful. The material
component of this spell is an ivory tablet with a yin-and-yang symbol  carved
upon it.

This  very  powerful  spell  reduces  a living,  intelligent  person  into  a
lascivious, nymphomaniac sex slave whose only interest is bringing the caster
to  orgasm  after creative orgasm. Once the spell has transpired, the  former
slave  remembers  everything that has happened. However,  the  subject  while
enslaved will not only not object but will enthusiastically agree with  every
sexual suggestion made short of death. This spell is unequivocally evil.

The  recipient  of  this spell undergoes a transformation  in  appearance  to
become  more sexually attractive to members of the opposite gender no  matter
what  the recipient's initial Comeliness. Looks, smell, smoothness, and  even

spell):

Note  that if two specialised wizards, an enchanter and an illusionist,  work
this magic in conjunction, then their levels may be added together to achieve
a  stronger  magic. Furthermore, this spell has the effect  of  negating  any
curse  magic  which  degrades the recipient's natural  beauty.  The  material
component of this spell is a cosmetic and perfume kit, magically prepared  by
a thaumaturge.

      This cantrip causes the recipient to gain a +1 modifier to Charisma for
every three levels of the wizard with respect to having sex. Thus, this spell
won't  affect any other aspects of Charisma: only sex. Most wizards cast  the
cantrip  on their partner, so the partner is more desirable, thus  making  it
easier  for  the  wizard to perform. The reverse of this  cantrip  is  sexual
disgust. The modifier is -1 for every three levels of the wizard rather  than
+1.

By means of this spell, the victim is caused to become terribly horny for the
duration  of  the spell. The victim has a saving throw as for a  charm  spell
(q.v.). This spell causes the victim to actively seek sex (or in case of  the
reverse, abhor it) for the duration of the spell. The material component  for
this  spell  is  a  straight, non-magical rod. That for the  reverse,  sexual
lethargy, is a small, supple twig.

This  spell  affects  one opponent and one friendly  creature  per  3  caster
levels. It gives the victim's shadow a quasi-real existence (the victim  must
be  touched), and allows the attackers enchanted by the spell to  attack  the
shadow for damage that will carry over to the victim. If the victim makes his
saving throw, the damage is halved before it is carried over to him. The only
defense is dispel magic or a continual light to rid the room of shadows.  The
material components for this spell are demon blood and some black silk scrap.

This   was   researched  by  Darklight  in  order  to  recreate  the   fabled
transformation  of  a mortal into undying shadow-stuff. It  was  seen  as  an
alternative to a potion of longevity (which is difficult to make) or  lichdom
(which  brings  the  stigma  of  undead onto  oneself).  The  experiment  was
successful, as this spell attests.
The  spell  is  highly difficult to cast, taking a full month of  preparation
(involving rare and dangerous components) before casting, and an entire  week
to  cast (the caster might have to take precautions not to fall asleep during
the casting). It irrevocably changes the caster of the spell into the type of
creature known to men as a shade (see the Monster Manual II).
The  body  of  the caster is infused and altered with shadow-stuff  from  the
plane of shadow. This process permanently incurs a psychological weakness  in
the  caster,  amplifying  some  trait which  formerly  existed  into  a  true
downfall.  This may not actually cause the shade to be incapable of happiness
or  meaningful existence, but it does add an element of the tragic into their
nature.
The wizard may continue to advance in levels after becoming a shade, but will
probably be more comfortable living on the plane of shadow. The wizard  gains
all  the  powers and vulnerabilities of a shade, including becoming  immortal
unless slain.
This process costs anywhere from 10,000-60,000 gp, and involves the heart  of
a  shadow  dragon, cloaker blood, and phase spider venom. It is not  an  evil
process,  but  the shadowphilic nature of shade-life is not  appealing  to  a
truly  good  creature. It is best suited for neutral (or  evil)  beings.  The
shadow-mage  Darklight has undergone this process, and has lived for  several
centuries as a shade, during which time most of his spell research has  taken
place.

This brings into being a shadowy construct that people who believe in it  can
see  clearly. The wizard automatically believes in the spell, others have  to
save versus spell to do so.
The bridge will support any weight put upon it, as long as that weight is put
there  by people who believe in the spell (physical objects dropped onto  the
bridge  will fall through), even if there is no apparent support. The  bridge
can take on the form of a bridge, staircase or ladder.
The  bridge  lasts  for  the  duration,  but  only  as  long  as  the  wizard
concentrates on it and has line of sight with it. The wizard can  discontinue
the spell at any time.

This  spell causes a sphere of shadowy light to spring up. Within this sphere
any  normal  light or sound source is dimmed so they do not cause  light  nor
shadow  nor  sound to vanish completely but to be dimmed. Within  the  sphere
there  reigns a completely shadowy light not unlike the one on the  plane  of
shadow.  In  this  sphere a thief can use his ability to "hide  in  shadows",
"move  silently", and the "disguise" proficiency at a bonus of 20% (or  a  +4
bonus).  Any other sneaky abilities also gain the 20% or +4 bonus, as decided
by  the  DM. Within this sphere it is possible to enter the plane  of  shadow
with  a  teleport without error, or for shades it is possible  to  use  their
plane shift ability. This spell can be dispelled by a dispel magic (or a more
powerful  similar spell) or a continual light which is cast for the  explicit
reason  to  cancel  this spell. If it is cast just to  light  up  the  sphere
normally,  the  shadow light remains and the continual  light  is  cancelled.
Note:  a  light  is not enough to cancel this spell, even if  cast  with  the
explicit reason to dispel the shadow light. If this spell is cast on somebody
unwilling,  that creature gets a saving throw versus spell. If  it  succeeds,
shadow  light takes effect 5 feet behind the creature. Otherwise the creature
carries the spell with it (but is not otherwise affected by it unless  it  is
susceptible to shadowy light).

The  material  component is a black silk veil which is laced with  ten  black
pearls worth no less than 50 gp each.

This spell brings into being a dark, hardwood quarterstave, that gives off  a
slight,  dark glow. The stave is woven from wisps from the plane  of  shadow,
and remains in existence for the duration of the spell.
The  weapon is considered to be magical, with a +1 rating per every 5  levels
of  the  wizard  (+1 to-hit, +1 damage, -1 initiative). The  wizard  has  the
weapon  ready  to  parry  or  attack at the  end  of  the  casting,  (somatic
components allow the action of a normal quarterstave attack).
Only  the wizard can use the weapon. If the staff is dropped, only the wizard
can  pick it up. To all others it is insubstantial. The wizard can phase  the
weapon in and out of reality (this action is considered to be at speed 1, and
can  be  combined with a normal attack, for example, to phase the staff  into
reality,  and  perform a normal attack, the weapon speed  is  1  higher  than
normal).  While it is phased out of reality, the staff is only solid  in  the
wizard's hands, it appears to be a shadow of its normal form, and it can pass
through  physical objects. While phased, it can hit incorporeal objects  that
are involved with the shadows.
The  weapon  does  1d6 + the plusses listed above points of temporary  damage
(that  lasts  for an hour) to physical beings. Illusionary band  beings  made
from shadows take permanent damage.
Material components are powdered carbon, and at least a splinter of hardwood.

This  spell is exactly like astral wall, except that it additionally  forbids
magical  or  mystical  sensing through the wall. Thus,  clairvoyance,  detect
spells,  mystical detection abilities, a basilisk's gaze, etc.  will  not  be
able  to  pass  through a shadow wall. Other effects (including the  duration
increase) are as astral wall. The material component is a piece of paper with

This  spell  creates arrows from wisps from the plane of  shadows,  when  the
wizard  performs the somatic action of drawing a physical, unloaded bow,  and
mutters  the word "shadowbolt". The arrow is then fired as normal,  requiring
an  attack roll to hit the target, doing 1d8 points of damage. Obviously, the
wizard should know how to use a bow.
After the spell is initially cast, up to 2 arrows per level of the wizard can
be  fired within the next hour. Only the wizard can use the arrows, and  they
disappear both whether they hit the target or not.

Shadowfire combines fireball and darkness, 15-foot radius. The spell  creates
an  immobile area of darkness, 20 feet in radius. The instant after the spell
is cast, the darkness is filled with rippling black fire, doing 1d4 points of
damage  per level of the wizard, to a maximum of 10 dice. A saving  throw  is
allowed  for  half damage, but not to ignore the darkness.  The  damage  only
occurs on the first instant, not in subsequent rounds. Unlike a fireball, the
flames  do  not adjust to fill thier maximum potential volume.  The  material
component is a lump of coal.

This  spell animates and gives substance to shadows, causing them to  protect
the spellcaster. In a 10-foot radius area, shadows distort vision, giving the
wizard a -2 bonus to Armour Class. Any creature which enters the radius  must
save versus fear or flee for one round per level of the priest. Creatures  of
10  or  more  levels or Hit Dice save at +3. The shadows help to  block  non-
magical  missile attacks. All such attacks inflict -2 on each die  of  damage
(with  a  minimum of 0). Finally, the wizard can use the spell  to  transport
himself  to  the plane of shadow. This transportation takes 3 rounds,  during
which  the  wizard  must concentrate on the spell. If  the  concentration  is
broken,  the  entire  spell  fails.  Also, this  transportation  is  one-way:
shadowguard  cannot  be used to move from the plane of shadow  to  any  other
plane.  There  must  be a significant amount of shadows  for  this  spell  to
operate, although darkness is a suitable replacement. The shadow created by a
large tree is not sufficient, but that of a large building will do.

      This spell has three different potential functions, the choice of which
may be made at the time of casting:

Hide. The wizard may cast shadows upon himself, with this covering giving him
a  chance of hiding in shadows as that for a thief of equal level. The wizard
can  take advantage of (or is penalised by) Dexterity and racial adjustments.
This  form of the spell is only shadow enhancing, so an effort must still  be
made  to hide. It can be cast only on the wizard's person (a range of  0  for
this  function), and the wizard must remain still and concentrate faintly  to
maintain the shadows. This can only be of use where shadows already exist. If
the  wizard is also a thief, this spell can be used to either give the chance
of  hiding as described above or add a 2% per level (wizard's level)  to  the
character's normal thief chances of hiding in shadows.

Distract. This version causes a number of shadowy forms to dart about up to 6
yards distant in a 2-yard square area, until the spell expires. This could be
most  distracting, for it appears as though there are humanoid  and  possibly
animal  forms  moving  about. These shadows cannot exist  in  sunlight  or  a
continual light, but could still be seen jumping between areas of cover.

Scare.  This  version  creates the illusion of a number  of  humanoid  forms,
appearing exactly as the undead shadow. Up to 1 form per level can  be  made,
appearing in a 10 feet + 1 foot per level square area. The wizard has control
over  each  form's  actions.  While they may  look  like  shadows,  they  are
completely  powerless  (with  the exception,  perhaps,  of  causing  fear  or
uncertainty - a normal reaction for one confronted with this situation).  The
wizard must maintain concentration, and even then the maximum duration  of  3
rounds per level still applies. If he breaks concentration, the shadows  will
last 1d2 rounds longer before fading away.

and  sounds  used  to  cast spells. Essentially, an illusion  of  the  caster
performing mundane activities applicable to the current situation is created,
i.e.,  eating  food if at a banquet or browsing through goods  at  a  bazaar.
Viewers  that  suspect  that something is amiss are allowed  a  saving  throw
versus  death magic at a -2 to negate the effects of the spell in so  far  as
the viewer is concerned. Viewers that make their saving throw are allowed  to
communicate  the  truth  of the fallacy to others,  thus  allowing  them  one
additional  saving  throw  with a +2 on the die roll.  The  reaction  of  the
viewers is entirely dependent upon the situation at hand (peasants and  serfs
might  become  frightful, while regents and royalty could be infuriated,  for
instance).
If  desired, the Wizard may cancel the spell at any time. The spell lasts for
1  turn  per level of the caster or until the wizard character has  cast  any
quantity of spells equal in level to the experience level of the wizard.

This  spell  allows  the wizard to assume the form of any undead  (very  rare
types of undead could be beyond the power of this spell, at the discretion of
the DM). The wizard must have at least twice as many levels as the undead has
Hit   Dice.  The  wizard  gains  all  the  abilities  of  the  undead  except
spellcasting and innate spell-like abilities. Thus the fear aura of  a  lich,
charm  gaze of a vampire and magic jar ability of a ghost would not be gained
through use of this spell. Most touch attacks are not considered to be spell-
like  abilities. The wizard also gains all the vulnerabilities of the undead,
and  can  be  turned, commanded or even disrupted by priests. The wizard  can
make  one change of form for every three levels, but cannot return to  normal
form  until the spell duration expires or the magic is dispelled. If  at  any
point the wizard assumes the form of an undead that drains levels, the wizard
must make a saving throw versus death magic at the end of the spell or lose a
level. The material component of this spell is a bit of rotted flesh.

When  cast  on an edged weapon, the weapon will become a weapon of  sharpness
upon  its  next  use, and will remain that way f1 round per 3 levels  of  the
wizard. The weapon may not be magical, except if subject enchant an item.
The  spell adds no plusses to the weapon (it severs on a 20), but plusses due
to  quality or enchant an item do apply. The material component is a  mithril
razor enchanted to +3 with enchant an item, costing 500 gp. The spell can  be
made  permanent,  but  to do so requires a specially  forged  weapon,  and  a
miniature  version of the weapon forged from the same metals in lieu  of  the
razor. The total cost is at least 30,000 gp.

This  spell  will  cause the casters next word to be so  loud  that  it  will
destroy  any large building, or area of a wall the priest is able to  affect.
It  will  also destroy boulders, towers, roofs, etc. The spell has no  direct
effect  on  living,  though the destruction of a building  may  have  adverse
effects  on  its  occupants, but it will do 5d20 damage against  undead.  The
building is allowed to save on this chart:

          Strong wall, brick, rock, steel    8
          Soft wall, earth    12
          Thick wood     15
          Thin wooden wall    20

This  saving  throw is modified by  1 for every 3 levels of the  priest.  The
material component for this spell is a small horn.

When this spell is cast, it empowers strong magics between a creature and  an
item.  The  effect of this spell is to allow a creature to store  a  favoured
item into an extra-dimensional space and bring it forth at will.
The  object, while it is in its space, is completely undetectable, except  by
means  of  a  wish. It will also be perfectly safe in the space where  it  is
held.
During  the  casting of the spell, two command words and a  physical  gesture
must  be  specified. The command words are those to make the item  leave  and
enter the "storage" space. The gesture is used with the command to bring  the
object back into the owner's possession. For example, a creature would make a
sword-holding gesture while using the proper command to retrieve his sword.

The  material  components for this spell is a 5000 gp of blue  sapphire  dust
which is sprinkled on a phase spider web. The web is then wrapped around  the
object and the enchantments are completed.
This is a great way to carry around important equipment. Wizards are prone to
cast this upon their spellbooks to always keep them handy.

This  spell  creates an invisible barrier in a hemisphere around the  wizard.
This barrier provides the equivalent protection of:
           AC  0  versus  hand thrown objects (daggers, dart, throwing  axes,
etc.);
          AC 1 versus device propelled (arrows, bolts, etc.);
          AC 2 versus everything else.
Against  magic  the wizard gains +1 to saving throws versus things  that  are
physically damaging, negates magic missiles, and decreases spell damage by  1
point per level.

This spell causes the gravity plane of a ship to shift by up to a maximum  of
20  feet  per level. This means that if a gravity plane of a ship had  passed
through the keel of the ship it could now be shifted up or down (if cast by a
16th-level  caster) by up to 320 feet upward or downward. If it  were  pushed
upward  it  would  cause everything to fall upward until  it  either  strikes
another  solid object above it or it falls upward until it meets the  gravity
plane  whereupon  the thrust will be reversed and so on. If it  were  shifted
downwards  the  crew  would probably not notice anything unless  the  gravity
plane had passed somewhere through the ship amidships. The later effect would
only  cause  some  problems if another ship would pass close  enough  to  the
affected ship so that their gravity planes would intersect. In that case  the
larger  ship would cause the ship with the lower tonnage to instantly  adjust
its  gravity  plane to the larger ship. Thus, this effect could  cause  quite
some damage to either ship in combat.
This spell requires a scale made from mithril which is severely imbalanced by
having  one  arm  made  extremely thick and  one  arm  extremely  thin.  This
imbalance has to be countered by applying one ancient copper coin (more  than
1000  years  old)  to the lighter side of the scale per ton  of  ship  to  be
affected. The scale has to be large enough to contain all coins at once.  The
scale itself has to cost no less than 10,000 gp.

This  spell  causes the target creature to temporarily shift to the  ethereal
plane. The person can then travel his normal movement rate. At the end of the
round,  the target creature shifts back to the plane on which the  spell  was
cast.  All  objects carried by the target shift with it. The target  creature
can only move (no attacking is possible while shifted). The target is seen as
a  wispy outline of the figure it normally is on the prime material plane, if
normally  invisible,  no  wispy  ouis visible.  The  target  creature,  while
shifted,  can only be targeted by attacks that can reach the ethereal  plane.
This  spell  was  mainly designed to allow casters to  pass  through  a  wall
without  having  to open a large hole in the wall (as with a passwall).  Only
things that are physically carried are shifted to the ethereal plane.

This spell summons a 4 HD lighting elemental. The elemental has a movement of
12,  and  can attack once per round for 3d4 points of electrical damage.  The
elemental  can  cast one 4d6 lighting bolt per turn. If the  elemental  moves
more  than  50  yards form the caster at any time, it will be destroyed.  Any
native  to  the elemental planes of air or lighting can dissipate it  with  a
touch. The material component of this spell is a small silver pendant, shaped
like a bolt of lightning.

This  spell creates a small ball of crackly blue light which expands outwards
when  it contacts a solid object, hits its target, reaches its maximum  range
or  it  reaches the point where the wizard wishes it to expand. When it  does
expand,  a  large  amount of electrical energy is given off, small  lightning
bolts arc from object to object inside the sphere and blue light is given off
in  a  6-inch  diameter sphere. All creatures within the area of effect  must
make  a  saving throw versus spell or take 1d3 points of damage per level  of
the  wizard  (a  successful  saving throw  means  damage  is  halved).  If  a
particular creature was targeted for the spell then they take 1d4  points  of
damage per level of the wizard and their saving throw is made at a -2.
If  the area in which the shocksphere expands is not circular then the sphere
will  expand  an  conform  to  the  volume it  can  occupy.  The  shocksphere
encompasses a volume of 4200 cubic feet. If a creature fails its saving throw
versus  spell then all of his items must make a saving throw versus lightning
or  be  destroyed. The material component for the spell is a small  chunk  of
dried  flesh from an electric eel or any other creature that uses electricity
for an attack.
Otherwise, this spell is similar to a fireball spell in all respects.

This  spell  sends  a  high energy tremor through  the  ground  in  a  circle
surrounding  the wizard. All creatures on the ground at the time  of  casting
are  affected.  The  shockwave causes 10d6+10  damage  (save  for  half).  In
addition,  all  creatures  with fewer than 4 legs are  automatically  knocked
down.  Creatures  with  4 or more legs can make a Dexterity  check  (or  save
versus  death magic for creatures with no dexterity) to keep their feet.  All
creatures  are  stunned fo1d6 rounds, and wizards and priests  may  not  cast
spells for 1d6 rounds after that. Creatures who save are stunned for 1 round,
and  may cast spells 1d4 rounds after. The material components of this  spell
are earth elemental remains and a shard of a tree struck by lightning.

This  spell allows the wizard to shout with such intensity that a sonic field
is  generated, expanding in a thirty degree radius from the wizard, doing 1d4
HP + 1 HP per level of damage to all within 5 feet per level of the wizard in
a  30   arc.  Glass  stands a 10% up to 50% chance of breaking  depending  on
whether  it  is  free  standing, fragile, muffled, or sturdy,  and  creatures
caught  in the area of effect suffer deafness for 1d10 melee rounds.  Victims
save  versus death magic for half damage or suffer extended deafness for 1d10
hours  and are stunned for 1d4 rounds. Note that hard surfaces (such as stone
walls)  caught  in the area of effect may cause the sonic field  to  ricochet
back upon the wizard, and that wandering monsters within 1d6x1000 feet may be
attracted.

     This spell fires a burst of shrapnel at the target. The shrapnel travels
in  a  straight line towards the target. Any intervening creatures must  save
versus dragon breath or be the spell's new target.

      The target is hit by 1d8 pieces of shrapnel, plus one piece of shrapnel
per  level  of the caster. Each piece causes 1 HP of damage and counts  as  a
separate attack (great for reducing spells such as stoneskin). A saving throw
versus  spell reduces the number of hits by half. The maximum number of  hits
is  1d8+8  at  eighth  level. The hits from the rocks  themselves  cannot  be
countered  by  magic  resistance, as they are  natural  rocks.  However,  the
enhancement that allows the rocks to damage magical creatures is affected  by
magic resistance.

The material component of this spell is a stone thweighs at least one pound.

This  spell  causes the mouth of the victim to disappear (only skin  will  be
present)  for the duration of the spell. The victim may not talk  (except  in
muffled  noise),  nor  place any objects in his mouth. When  cast  against  a
wizard,  a  dispel magic will negate shut up; however, concentration  of  any
previous  spell  in  the works will be broken. The material  component  is  a
plaster.

This  spell allows the caster to magically summon alcohol of any sort, within
the  caster's  tasting experience (the caster must have sampled  the  alcohol
beverage previously in his life). The tankard or whatever container  is  used
becomes full of the desired beverage.
One material component of the spell is the container which must be of a value
of no less than 10 gp (it is not consumed in the casting). The other material
component is pinch of hops or a few grapes.
Sidney  was a particularly alcoholic wizard who unfortunately could no longer
cast the spell because of the verbal components that were impossible to speak
in his constant drunken state.

This  spell  is a simple spell which speeds up the normal fermentation  times
for alcohol manufacture. The wizard can speed up fermentation by a maximum of
3  years  per level of the caster, and thus instantly have a truly fine  aged
wine. Of course, the wizard must be of fairly high level. If the wizard knows
how  long  fermentation normally takes (through research  or  just  being  an
alcoholic),  he  can cast this spell with automatic success: the  alcohol  is
ready  to be consumed. If the wizard doesn't know how long it should ferment,
it is guesswork. The DM then decides whether the brew is underdone (juice) or
overdone (vinegar). The material component is a sprinkle of hops.
This  spell  was originally researched by an alcoholic wizard  who  wsick  of
having  to wait years to produce a fine wine. A more powerful version of  the
spell  is  currently being researched in order to make wines of the magnitude
of thousands of years fermentation, but Sidney is having trouble with some of
the material components (a wine mug and pitcher from the Halls of Valhalla).

      The  wizard may inscribe or write his personal sigil, emblem,  or  seal
over  any  non-magical item. The sigil will prevent the opening of any  door,
chest,  or  lock until dispelled, and any person touching the item  inscribed
with the sigil (other than the wizard) will receive 1d4 points of damage.  If
a  knock is used to open the item inscribed, the item will open normally, but
the damage is still inflicted.

The  material  component of this spell is a key, which  is  consumed  in  the
casting.

This  spell  conjures a semi-real, shadowy dragon claw anywhere within  spell
range.  This  claw  will attack any target as directed by  the  wizard;  full
concentration  is  necessary to attack with the claw;  if  the  wizard  loses
concentration,  the  claw will hover in place until the  wizard  again  gains
control. The claw's attack uses the wizard's normal THAC0 and inflicts damage
equal to that of the dragon the material component came from. For example, if
the  material  component came from a black dragon, the  attack  inflicts  1d6
points of damage per attack.
For every 5 levels of the wizard, one attack with the claw may be made, up to
a maximum of 4 attacks, although only a single attack may be made in a single
round.  The  claw dissipates when the maximum number of attacks is  made,  or
when the spell duration expires, whichever comes first. The claw may also  be
dispelled, but may not be harmed by other attacks.

The  material component for this spell is the claw from any type  of  dragon;
this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

When this spell is cast, the wizard will be covered by a semi-real coating of
dragon  scales.  The  type  of dragon that provided  the  material  component
determines  the protection afforded by this spell: the Armour  Class  of  the
wizard is equal to the appropriate dragon's Armour Class at age category 1d6.
For  example, if the material component was obtained from a green dragon, and
a  6  is  rolled for the age category, the wizard would have AC  -2  for  the
duration of this spell.

The  material  component for this spell is a small pouch of scales  from  any
type of dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell  is  similar to Sillvatar's dragon claw,  except  it  conjures  a
shadowy dragon head within spell range. The procedures for attacks are as per
that  spell, except the victims who are hit receive bite damage,  instead  of
claw  damage. For example, if this spell is cast using the material component
from  a  white dragon, the damage inflicted by each successful  bite  is  2d8
points of damage. In addition, each attack receives a +2 on all to-hit rolls.
The  wizard may conduct 2 attacks using this spell, each of which must  occur
in  a  separate round. The dragon head dissipates when both attacks have been
made,  the duration expires, or the head is dispelled. The head is not harmed
by other attacks.

The  material component for this spell are the teeth from any type of dragon;
these teeth are consumed when the spell is cast.

This  spell  conjures  a dragon head similar to that created  by  Sillvatar's
dragon bite; however, instead of bite damage, the wizard may direct the  head
to make a single, instantaneous breath attack. The dimensions and composition
of  this breath attack are as per the dragon the material component is  from.
The  damage  inflicted  by  this  attack is  equal  to  an  attack  from  the
appropriate  dragon,  of  age  category 1d6  (determine  age  randomly).  For
example,  if  a red dragon is the source of the material component  for  this
spell,  and a 4 is rolled for the age category, the breath attack  takes  the
shape of a 90x5x30 feet cone of fire, and inflicts 8d10 points of damage. All
victims must save versus the worst of spell or breath weapon to receive  only
half  damage; possessions are treated as if they had been hit by  the  actual
corresponding  breath  weapon (if the victim's saving throw  was  successful,
possessions are not affected).

The  material component for this spell is the heart from any type of  dragon;
this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

When  this spell is cast, the wizard conjures a shadowy pair of dragon  wings
that  appear  on his body; these wings provide the wizard with  the  movement
(flying)  rate  of  the  dragon  that produced the  material  component.  For
example,  if the material component was taken from a blue dragon, the  wizard
would  be able to fly at a rate of 30 with a manoeuvrability class of C.  The
colour of the wings' scales will also correspond to the appropriate type. The
wings will last for 2 rounds per level of the wizard, or until dispelled.

The  material component for this spell is the wing muscle from  any  type  of
dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

This spell will enchant one normal staff with a temporary magical dweomer. In
order to cast this spell, a ruby worth at least 300 gp is bound to the end of
the  staff; this gem will glow with a soft light as long as the spell  is  in
effect. This spell may have one of two effects as decided at the time of  the
casting: the staff may be used to discharge a fireball as per the spell; this
will  have  all the effects (including dice of damage) as if the  wizard  had
cast a fireball; discharging the fireball has a casting time of 1. If used in
this  manner, the spell expires after the fireball is used, or after 1  round
per  level  of  the wizard has passed (if not used in that  time,  the  spell
dissipates, and has no effect).
Alternately, the wizard may employ a number of lesser effects: if  the  staff
scores a hit in combat, the staff will discharge a burst of flames that  will
engulf  the target; these flames inflict 1d4 points of damage, plus  1  point
per  level  of  the  wizard (up to a maximum of 1d4+20). A successful  saving
throw versus spell reduces the damage by one half; if the saving throw fails,
all  possessions must save versus magical fire, or be consumed. The staff may
be used in this manner once per five levels of the wizard (to a maximum of  4
times).  If  the  staff misses its targets, no charge is used  (nor  may  the
wizard  elect  to do so); a charge is used only if a hit is  scored.  If  all
charges  are  not  used  in  1  round per level  of  the  wizard,  the  spell
dissipates, and all remaining charges are lost.
The  only material components for this spell are the staff and the ruby;  the
ruby is consumed when the spell ends, but the staff is not affected.

This spell is identical to Sillvatar's flamestaff, except that it may be used
to  discharge  a  lightning bolt (as per the spell) or electrical  discharges
when  a hit is scored in combat. Damage, duration, etc. are identical to that
of  the  flamestaff. Saving throws for possessions are made versus  lightning
for both applications of this spell.
Instead of a ruby, this spell has a sapphire for a material component; it  is

This  spell is used to temporarily enchant a weapon to give it the properties
of  a silver weapon. In order for this spell to work, the wizard must have  1
silver piece per pound of the weapon to be enchanted. When the spell is cast,
the  weapon is held in one hand, and the silver pieces in the other; the  two
are  then touched together, and the blade absorbs the silver pieces. For  the
duration of the spell, or until it is dispelled, the weapon will have all the
properties of a silver weapon (i.e., it may be used to hit creatures who  are
normally harmed only by silver weapons). If one looks closely at the  weapon,
a silver glint will be seen upon its edge.
This spell will only enchant slashing or piercing weapons; blunt weapons  are
not  affected by this spell. One melee weapon, or up to two arrows  or  bolts
may be enchanted per casting of this spell.
The only component for this spell are the silver pieces.

The  caster of this spell is able to summon to his aid one or more pre-chosen
individuals;  the creatures to be summoned must be chosen  at  the  time  the
spell is cast and must be willing to receive the summons. The total number of
levels or Hit Dice of the individuals summoned must be equal to, or less than
the level of the wizard.
When the spell is initially cast, the wizard must follow a set procedure  for
each  person  or creature summoned: first the individual must be marked  with
wizard  mark;  this  must then be made permanent through  the  casting  of  a
permanency  (to  prevent the mark from wearing off).  Finally,  the  superior
summons is cast; this entire process takes two turns, plus the casting  times
of  the  other two spells. Each recipient must be marked by a separate wizard
mark,  but a single casting of permanency and superior summons will  suffice.
These marks are visible only to the wizard and the recipient (although a true
seeing or similar magic will reveal them) and will remain until dispelled  or
the spell is triggered.
When  the  wizard  wishes  to trigger the spell, the final  incantations  are
uttered  along with the names of each of the recipients (this has  a  casting
time of 5). The summoned individuals will appear anywhere within 100 feet  of
the  wizard, as desired. The individuals to be summoned must be on  the  same
plane  as the wizard when the spell is cast (triggered) or they cannot answer
the summons.
The reverse of this spell, Sillvatar's superior sending, will send the marked
individuals to a pre-chosen location (a separate location may be  chosen  for
each recipient). The result is similar to teleport without error, but with  a
separate location for each recipient. The same procedure must be followed  as
for  the  superior  summons, and since the wizard mark  disappears  when  the
individual  is  summoned, multiple castings of this spell,  as  well  as  the
wizard  mark and permanency, are required to send summoned creatures back  to
where they came from.

The  material component for this spell is a diamond worth at least 500 gp for
each individual to be summoned. These diamonds are powdered and sprinkled  on
the  wizard mark (this fulfils the component requirements for the wizard mark
as well).

This  spell provides the wizard with a method of attacking a specific  target
in  the midst of a crowd; when this spell is cast, a flaming bolt shoots from
the  palm of the wizard towards the intended victim. Only one target  may  be
chosen  for this spell, and the bolt strikes this individual unerringly.  The
bolt will dodge obstructions and other creatures in its flight to the target;
it  will even round corners, if need be. As long as the spell's range is  not
exceeded,  and there is some path to the target, it will be struck;  even  if
the  victim ducks behind an obstacle while the spell is being cast, the  bolt
will  still strike home. The only stipulation is the target must be in  sight
when  the  spell incantations begin; the wizard may choose any target  within
sight (and range) but may not target such things as "the strongest member  of
the group" or "the orc leader" (see the description of magic missile for more
details).
When  the  bolt  impacts the target, it explodes in a burst  of  flames  that
engulf the victim; the flames conform to the shape of the target, so no other
creatures are affected by the spell unless they are touching the victim.  The
effects  of  the explosion are identical to a fireball doing 10d6  points  of
damage.  A  successful saving throw versus spell reduces the  damage  by  one
half. If this saving throw fails, the target must save versus magical fire at
-3 for all possessions; those that fail are destroyed.
Since  its inception, this spell has become a favourite of assassins; because
of  this,  Sillvatar has striven to remove it from circulation.  Due  to  his
efforts,  this  spell  is  not as common as it once was,  although  tens  and
perhaps even hundreds of copies still exist.

The material component for this spell is a handful of scales and the heart of
a red dragon; these components are consumed when the spell is cast.

      This spell simply allows the wizard to control a feather. This is  very
useful for writing things secretly, or for tickling someone. It is related to
the unseen servant spell. The material component for this spell is a feather.
It lasts until concentration is broken.

This  spell  grants  the priestess the ability of fast  talking:  during  the
spell's  duration,  the priestess is able to talk and  talk  and  talk,  thus
gaining  the  undivided  attention  of those  listening,  provided  they  can
understand  the  priestess.  Note that all  hearing  the  priestess  will  be
affected by this fast talking: party members are affected too.
The  second  use  of  this  spell is to increase  the  morale  of  hirelings,
followers and henchmen: prior to a fight, the priestess can encourage them by
talking  vividly for one round, thus increasing their morale  by  two  points
plus  one  for every two levels above first, up to a maximum of  5.  Thus,  a
fifth or sixth level priestess will increase the morale by 4 points.
The material component for this spell is a tongue, which need not be fresh.

Casting this spell creates up to five one-foot diameter spheres of electrical
energy to appear near the caster's person. The spheres may be grasped by  the
caster, and only by the caster, and thrown to attack with. Any other than the
caster who touches the spheres as they surround the caster is affected as  if
the sphere had been thrown at him.
The  spheres may thus be used as a defense of sorts, but are best used as  an
attacking  spell.  The spheres are thrown as normal missile  weapons  by  the
caster  with normal Dexterity bonuses applicable, but no penalties for  range
of  target from the caster so long as the target is within the range  of  the
spell. Only two spheres may be thrown per round.
The  spheres inflict 4d6 HP of electrical damage, plus 1d6 HP for  every  two
levels  of  the  caster above ninth (i.e., 7d6 at 11th, 8d6 at  13th,  etc.).
Creatures  with  conducting materials on their bodies,  either  partially  or
totally  (for instance, wearing metallic armour) are +3 (for partial)  or  +5
(for  total) to be hit by the caster with the sphere. A saving throw must  be
rolled  each round of the sphere's duration; a successful saving throw  means
the target takes half damage that round.
The  spheres  last for 1 round plus 1 round every four levels of the  caster.
The  spell itself lasts until all the spheres have been thrown or two  rounds
per level of the caster. The caster acquires one extra sphere for every three
levels  (8  spheres at ninth, 9 at twelfth, etc.). The caster can  choose  to
generate any amount up to his full capacity.
If  a  sphere  strikes a reflective surface, it will reflect  at  a  randomly
determined  angle.  Any  flat surface struck by a  sphere  must  save  versus
electricity  or be destroyed. If the surface saves, the sphere  is  reflected
(note:  throwing a sphere into a corner will act as if thrown directly behind
the  caster).  A  sphere may set fire to combustibles, sunder  wooden  doors,
splinter  stone,  and melt most precious metals. Unused  spheres  follow  the
caster  around,  acting  as passive defense, as he moves;  and  they  do  not
interfere with any auxiliary spellcasting.

The material components of this spell are a glass, crystal, or amber bead for
each sphere created, and a bit of fur.

      No material components. No gestures. Just a complicated guttural verbal
component.  Many  wizards  have tried to reduce  this  spell  to  a  cantrip.
However, it doesn't seem to be possible to reduce the verbal component enough
to do this. Perhaps adding a small somatic gesture?

      Each  casting  halves the volume and effectively  doubles  the  percent
alcohol  in  the  liquid it is cast upon. The catch is that  the  water  goes
first.  Thus,  if beer containing 10% alcohol is placed in the pot,  then  it
will  lose  half its volume, but will now contain 20% alcohol. When  all  the
water is gone, some other liquid (juice, etc.) has to go next (DM's choice).

      Effects are similar to Darkblood's travel size distillery (see the  Net
Alcohol Guide for more information on this item). In fact, this is one of the
spells Darkblood used in creating his distillery.

      This  spell  has no effect on any living being, except (perhaps)  water
elementals. This is up to the DM. For example, the water elemental must  save
versus spell or lose half its remaining hit points when struck by this spell.
A  successful  saving throw indicates half damage or loss of  fourth  of  the
remaining  hit  points. This is clearly a very powerful spell  against  water
elementals, but how many times does one see water elementals? If  this  is  a
problem than simply rule it doesn't affect water elementals either, or  lower
the damage it causes.

The ultimate seige breaker... When the caster casts this spell on a roach, it
works its way into the enemies camp. Once in the camp, the roach finds a nice
place  and starts to sing really bad. All within the camp must make a  saving
throw  versus spell or leave camp and go home. If they make the saving throw,
must make another one each turn with a cumulative -1 to the roll. Needless to
say,  sieges  don't  last long... I know it's a dumb spell,  but  it  is  the
funniest thing to use in a siege or large enemy encampment.

The material component for this spell is a seige tower, which is consumed  in
the casting.

Upon  the casting of this spell, a section of ground that the wizard  targets
becomes a sinkhole, 10 feet in radius. Up to four creatures (caster's  choice
of  number  affected)  must be in range, and they are counted  out  from  the
centring point of the of the spell (thus, PCs or friendly NPCs may be  caught
in  the  area  of  effect  if they are closer to the centre  than  a  hostile
creature  is).  Those in the area of effect must make a saving  throw  versus
spell  to negate the spell straight off. The saving throw is modified by  the
number affected.

     Creatures Affected  Modifier
     1    -2
     2    -1
     3    0
     4    +1

Should  the creatures affected make their saving throw, then they are assumed
to have thrown themselves out of the area as the sinkhole started. This saves
them  from  the spell, but also causes them to automatically lose  initiative
for the next round, being last in the round. If they fail their saving throw,
the  spell takes effect and the next round begins the duration of the  spell.
Note  that  the  modifiers above apply to all saving throws listed  below  as
well.
           First  round: if they have failed their initial saving throw  (see
above)  they are effectively held (as per hold person, even if they aren't  a
person) and start to sink.
           Second  round:  they  must save again at -2 (plus  any  additional
modifiers  above).  If  they  succeed, they cease  to  sink,  but  are  still
effectively held. If they fail, they continue to sink.
           Fourth round: they must save again at -4 (plus modifiers). If they
succeed,  they cease to sink, but are still effectively held. If  they  fail,
they go under the sands. They die in 2 rounds (last round of the duration) if
they are not rescued.
Should  a  dispel  magic be cast successfully on the sinkhole,  at  any  time
before  the  duration  expires, all trapped creatures are  ejected  from  the
ground,  and may act the next round. Should the duration end with the victims
effectively  held and above the surface, they may get back on their  feet  as
their action for the next round.

The  material component for the spell is an egg timer, which is destroyed  in
the casting of the spell.

This  spell  must  be cast on a specific, circular area. It  affects  all  of
Intelligence 2 or higher with no saving throw. Undead are immune to it.
All  those  who  enter receive a clear mental warning not to proceed.  It  is
faint  at  the edge of the circle but it grows stronger as they approach  the
centre.  The  subjects have an overwhelming feeling of danger  but  they  are
otherwise  unaffected: the spell cannot impede the progression  of  a  strong
willed,  determined individual. Language is not a barrier for this is  purely
an emotional, wordless message.
The material component of the spell is a gem of at least 20 gp value. It must
be  placed in the centre of the area and then blessed by the caster. The  gem
radiates a pale, green aura which dimly illuminates the surroundings.
At  half  a foot of the gem the feeling of danger is nearly insufferable  and
will affect all creatures regardless of Intelligence. To get closer, one must
save  versus petrification and make a Strength check: both with a  5 penalty.
Those  who fail in one of these are paralysed with terror for 1d4 rounds  and
cannot try again to get closer until they gain a level.
Small  projectiles (hurled rocks, arrows, etc.) and poles  wielded  by  other
creatures cannot touch the gem. The caster can hide or protect the  gem  with
other spells as the spell ends at once if the gem is disturbed in any way.
The spell is usually used to prevent entrance to dangerous areas. Only one of
higher  level  than the caster when he cast it can dispel the  warning.  This
spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary units  are
for the Dark Sun, increase where appropriate.

school who like to cast it on haughty, preppy girls.

This  spell conjures into being one of two forms of Armour. One form is  hard
bone  plating  attached to the wizard, this plating can absorb 10  points  of
damage for every Constitution point that the caster has. The second form is a
bone field (swarm of bones) that effectively lowers the caster's Armour Class
by  4  points.  it  is  possible to cast spells through either  version.  The
material component for this spell is a warrior's shoulderblade.

This spell creates an undead scribe for the wizard. It is not permanent,  but
is  much  safer to use for reading new tomes and writing down words of  great
power.  It  is able to take dissertation as well. The material components  of
this  spell  are a skeleton, a hawk feather, and a red robe. The skeleton  is
only consumed at the end of the duration.

This spell is an advanced version of skip self (q.v.). The caster can skip  a
number  of  people  equal to his level for a number of rounds  equal  to  the
factorial of his level plus 10 (a 7th-level wizard, for example, can  skip  a
group  forward  7+6+5+4+3+2+1+10=38 rounds). All  of  the  subjects  must  be
willing,  and within 60 foot radius of the caster. Any non-living object  the
group  is wearing or holding at the time of the casting is skipped with them,
excluding  powerful  magic  items  such as artifacts  and  relics.  Unwilling
subjects  are  not affected by this spell. If desired, the caster  can  place
recipients of this spell at points in the future before the spell's  duration
has  expired, even placing different people at different times, although,  if
he  includes himself in the spell, he must state this intent at the  time  of
casting. The experience of time skipping is disorienting for non-warpwizards;
these  characters must make a saving throw versus spell (at +2) or  be  dazed
for  1d3  rounds. During this time, no offensive action may be taken,  Armour
Class is increased by 2, and all saving throws are made at -1.

     This spell can be cast on any non-living object with a volume no greater
than 1 cubic foot per level of the caster. Magical items and those items held
or  worn by an unwilling creature receive a saving throw of 12. Magical items
with  plusses or minuses receive a bonus to their saving throw equal to  this
modifier (which means that a cursed -2 sword would receive the same bonus  as
a  +2 sword). Other magic items receive bonuses corresponding to the strength
of  their  magic (as determined by the DM): +1 for weak magic, +2 to  +3  for
moderate  magic, and +4 (or more) for strong magic. Artifacts and relics  are
not  affected by this spell. For every third level of the caster, this saving
throw is further modified by a -1 (-1 at third level, -2 at sixth, etc.). The
effect of this spell is to cause the object in question to be skipped forward
in time a number of rounds equal to the factorial of the caster's level, plus
one   (a   5th-level  wizard,  for  example,  can  skip  an  object   forward
5+4+3+2+1+1=16  rounds).  During the time the object  is  being  skipped,  it
ceases  to  exist,  and there is no way to affect it  in  any  way.  When  it
reappears, if something has moved to occupy the space it previously  was  in,
it  will  move to the nearest open space. The caster can choose to bring  the
object  back any time before the expiration of the spell, at which  time  the
spell ends.

This is a variation on the 1st-level skip object, only this spell affects the
caster, including any non-living object he is wearing or holding at the  time
of  casting  (except for artifacts and relics, which may not be skipped  with
this  spell). The caster can skip himself forward in time a number of  rounds
equal  to  the  factorial of his level plus three (a  5th-level  wizard,  for
example,  can skip himself forward 5+4+3+2+1+3=18 rounds). He can  decide  to
skip a lesser amount of time, but this must be stated when the spell is cast,
for  while he is "skipping", for all intents and purposes, he does not exist.
When  the  duration has expired, if something or someone occupies  the  space
previously  occupied  by the spell caster, he will reappear  instead  in  the
nearest open space.

With this spell the caster is able to project magical energy into the future,
effectively delaying the onset of one spell. The spell to be skipped must  be
cast  immediately after the casting of this spell; if there is any  delay  or
interruption,  skip spell will fail. Once the magical energy for  the  second
spell has been conjured, it is projected into the future a maximum number  of
rounds  equal to two times the factorial of the caster's level.  A  7th-level
wizard,  for example, can skip a spell (7+6+5+4+3+2+1)x2=54 rounds  into  the
future.  The  caster must determine at the time of casting  when  exactly  he
wants  the spell to be released, although he does have the option of bringing
the  spell into effect sooner, if he desires. This is a bit tricky, and there
is  a  base 100% chance that the spell will actually be released 1d4+1 rounds
later  than  desired.  This percentage is modified by -5%  for  every  caster
level,  down to a minimum of 25%. If the spell to be skipped is  aimed  at  a
specific  target,  and that target moves out of the spell's  range,  it  will
fail.

      Similar  to  the  effect of the skulk's renowned  ability,  this  spell
enables  the  recipient to change colour so as to blend with his  background;
however, unlike the skulk's ability, it changes not only the skin colour, but
the  colour  of  any items worn or carried also. The chance  of  successfully
hiding  depends on the activity of the recipient, as shown on  the  following
table:

Movement Rate   Chance of Success
-------------------------------------
0 (stationary)     80% + 2% per level
Up to 1            60% + 2% per level
Up to 3            40% + 2% per level
Up to 6            20% + 2% per level
Faster             2% per level

     The recipient may attack without ruining the spell, and will surprise on
a  1-4  in  6 if successfully hidden from view. Once seen, a creature  cannot
successfully  hide from an observer until first moving out  of  its  line  of
sight.  Note  that  chances to detect invisibility (see the Dungeon  Master's
Guide, page 60) apply against this spell. The material component is a bit  of
skin from a colour changing creature (such as a chameleon, troglodyte, skulk,
pseudo-dragon, etc.).

This  spell allows the caster to write messages in the sky, with but the wave
of  a  finger. The messages are written in glowing smoke, and are visible  at
night  or by day (caster's choice of colour). The caster may write up to  one
word  per  level,  with a duration of one hour per level  (halved  in  strong
winds). All writing must be contained within a sphere of volume 1 cubic  mile
per  level, centred on the caster, and at normal size, the writing is visible
(and  readable)  at around 50 miles. If desired, the caster  can  reduce  the
number of words written, and increase the viewing distance proportionally (to
a maximum factor equal to the radius of the area of effect).

This spell is the same as the 1st-level sleep, except as noted. All creatures
to  be  affected by sleep II must be within the 40-foot radius sphere created
upon  completion  of casting. The sphere must be centred  on  a  creature  or
object within sight and not an area; in addition the area of effect cannot be
reduced,  although the wizard can specify during the casting  that  creatures
closest  to the centre are to be affected first, dependent upon the Hit  Dice
of those creatures.
The  number  of creatures that can be affected is a function of the  wizard's
level: for every 2 levels of the wizard, 1d6 HD (rounded up) can be affected.
An example: a 5th-level wizard could affect 3d6 HD of monsters. Monsters with
6+1  or more are unaffected. The centre of effect is determined by the wizard
although the wizard may not be in the area of effect upon spell completion or
risk  its  effects. The creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected  first
(dependent upon the wizard's wishes, additionally creatures below  a  certain
Hit  Dice  may  be excluded), and partial effects are ignored.  The  material
components for this spell is a pinch of fine sand and rose petals, or a  live
cricket.

This  spell  is identical in every way to cloudkill, except that  instead  of
slaying  its  victims,  they are put to sleep for 1 hour  per  level  of  the
wizard,  up  to a maximum of 12 hours. They cannot be awakened by any  normal
means until at least ¬ of the sleep time has passed.
There  is  an up side to it, however: if the victims are not disturbed,  they
will  awaken completely refreshed, and will have healed at double the  normal
rate  due  to  the  depth of their rest. Consequently, this  spell  has  many
beneficial uses.
The  gas  created  by this spell is a deep indigo, and has a  pleasant  sweet
smell as opposed to cloudkill's vile green fumes.

This  devotion  allows  the somniomancer  to  take  control  of  a

Such  actions  include movement (sleep-walking),  picking  up  and
moving small objects, etc., but nothing either delicate or violent
and nothing that involves any thinking or decision-making process.
     The somniomancer can't force the subject to commit suicide or
actively  damage  herself in any way; the  subject  will  wake  up
before any damage be inflicted.
      This power doesn't give any way to somniomancer to see  what
the  subject is actually doing, so, the psionicist should be  able
to  see  the  target by any means or it will be very difficult  to
give the orders.

Power  Score:   The  psionicist  can  see  brief  flashes  of  the
surroundings of the person controlled.  Just enough to  make  sure
that the subject doesn't run into things.

20:   The  somniomancer loses control of their own  body  for  the
duration  of  the  power,  and  it  is  prone  to  twitching   and
convulsions.

This  is  a hypnosis-type spell: the wizard looks upon the victim and summons
the  power through his eyes. The victim must save versus death magic or  fall
into  a  deep sleep. The victim can only be awakened by been shaken  or  hit:
noise  will  never wake up the victim. If the victim meets the  gaze  of  the
wizard  when  the  spell  is being cast, then it  saves  at  -1.  The  verbal
component  is  a  single word of power that can be spoken  very  quickly  and
quietly (but must be heard by the victim).

The  recipient of the spell and a maximum of 25 pounds of his equipment  turn
into  a liquid form, which is still recognizable. The recipient becomes  very
slippery (no wrestling, overbearing, or other such attacks allowed), he gains
an  effective  AC 0 (not cumulative with anything else) and a 24  MV.  He  is
unable  to  support  anything solid (weapons, equipment, items  fall  to  the
ground)  and  no spellcasting is allowed. If the recipient enters  any  other
large liquid in this form he is almost indistinguishable (spotted only  by  a
successful Wisdom check), but he still must breathe normally.
Upon returning to his original form, he must pass a system shock or fall into
a coma for 1d4 turns.
Another spell researched by my water priest, Etrigan of Vanadi (a Tyrian).

      This  spell creates a stream of sharp stone shards that unerringly  hit
their  target. The stones inflict 1d4 + 1 points of damage. For  every  three
levels  gained,  the wizard inflicts another 1d4 + 1 points of  damage.  This
spell  is  the  earth  elementalist version of the magic missile  spell,  and
protections  against  that spell are also useful against  slivers  of  stone.
Slivers  of  stone  has the same limitations as magic missile.  The  material
component of this spell is a handful of stones, which must be thrown  at  the
target.

This will cause a creature to slowly wither away and die over a period of  13
days. After this he cannot be brought back to life short of a wish, or divine
intervention. If the spell is detected and identified by a priest of at least
ninth level, it can be removed. This can only be done before the eighth  day,
and can only be accomplished by a priest of fifteenth level, casting a remove
curse.

     This is similar to a normal fireball with the following exceptions: only
one  target  is  affected  (the wizard chooses the target  and  the  fireball
expands  until  the target is engulfed), damage is 1d4 HP per wizard's  level
(up  to  a  maximum of 10d4), and exposed items receive a +2 on their  saving
throws.  The material components for this spell are a bit of burning incense,
and a gem worth at least 5 gp; both are consumed with the casting.

      This  spell  reduces  a quantity of metal ore  to  the  pure  metal  it
represents.  No  slag is left, as it is consumed to provide  energy  for  the
spell.
A  wizard  may  reduce an amount of metal, per level, as shown by  the  table
below:

Ore         Amount                                Metal Resulting
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lead        80 pounds                             60 pounds
Copper      50 pounds                             30 pounds
Bronze      40 pounds of copper + 30 pounds       10 pounds of tin
Brass       40 pounds of copper + 30 pounds       10 pounds of zinc
Tin         50 pounds                             30 pounds
Iron        20 pounds                             10 pounds
Steel       10 pounds of steel + 5 pounds          1 pound of charcoal
Silver    30 pounds                             20 pounds
Gold        50 pounds                              ¬ poun
Mithril      1 pound                               1 ounce
Mercury      1 pound                               1 ounce

      By  this  method, low-level wizards should be able to smelt  the  daily
products  of a small mine. DMs should assign values to other metals based  on
their rarity, value, and usefulness as above.

      When  the spell is cast, the caster must place a small amount (a  coin,
drop, or small bar) of refined metal of the appropriate type on top the  pile
of  ore.  Then, as he speaks the words and makes motions of pumping a bellows
or  hammering, a bright light surrounds the ore, blinding all who look at  it
and  fail to save versus paralysation for 1d6 rounds. No heat is produced  by
this. When the light fades, a block of the pure metal of the indicated weight
is  seen  resting on the same surface the ore was on. In the case of mercury,
the  caster  must place the ore in a bowl before casting, or the  fluid  runs
off.

      This  spell  creates a smiley face which appears on the  object  to  be
affected.  This  smiley is created from the same material as  the  object  on
which  it  appears: if cast on a cloak it appears as an ironed-on smiley,  if
cast  on  a  shield it appears as a painting, etc. The smiley face cannot  be
removed  without  the use of dispel magic - and if this is  tried  it  always
works  at  one  hundred percent, but with the vanishing  of  the  smiley  the
material  it was on also vanishes - so that you get a smiley shaped  hole  in
the object, which does not destroy the object nor does it render it unusable,
but  you  have a hole in it nonetheless. Even a mug which had smiley cast  on
its bottom which was removed by dispel magic will have hole in its bottom but
it  can  still be filled with liquid without the liquid running  out  of  the
bottom.

This spell creates a 20-foot radius cloud of purple and black smoke up to  10
feet  away per level of the wizard. The smoke is impervious to all  forms  of
vision.  The  smoke  cloud  is  actually extradimensional,  employing  forces
similar to distance distortion. The internal diameter of the cloud is 100  to
150  feet;  furthermore,  the vapours contain a powerful  misdirection  spell
(saving  throw  at  -2) which prevents those inside from wandering  out.  The
cloud  persists for 1d4 rounds plus one round per level of the wizard,  after
which  it  disperses.  Only  a  strong wind will  break  it  up  prematurely.
Extradimensional devices in the cloud are unaffected.

The  material  component is a black pearl worth at least 500 gp  and  a  bent
compass needle.

This  spell  summons  a weak 3 HD smoke elemental. It hits  twice  for  1d4+1
points  of  damage and has a movement of 190 feet per round. The  smoke  will
choke  anyone  within  10 feet for 1d3 rounds. Any creature  from  the  para-
elemental plane of smoke, fire, or air can dissipate it with a touch. If  the
cloud  moves  more  than 40 feet away from the caster at any  time,  it  will
instantly dissipate. The material component is, not surprisingly, a  wisp  of
smoke.

Upon  casting this spell, the priest paralyses 1 to 3 snakes causing them  to
elongate or be reduced to the size of a flight arrow. Any size of snakes  can
be used but the snake must be non-magical. Then, these snakes can be fired as
arrows  as  they harden like wood while under the spell's effects. They  have
the  same range as flight arrows, unless the snake used is of size  L  or  G.
Then, the range is halved, but a +1 damage bonus is applied, due to the  mass
that is conserved, despite the change in size.
If  a  poisonous  snake is used, the victim must make a saving  throw  versus
poison  or  suffer  the ill effects of the poison the snake possesses  within
(the  DM decides). After the impact, the spell wears off, and the snake turns
back to its original form without getting injured, even if it had hit a plate
armour  or a tree or any other kind of barrier, as it is under the protection
of the spell. The arrow itself does 1d6 HP of damage, and if the snake was  L
or G, an additional 1d8 damage is taken as the creature grows in the body.
After the spell expires, the snake's attitude is determined by a 1d4 roll:  a
1  means  the  snake  continues to attack its victim, a 4 indicates  that  it
starts  looking for the priest to take some kind of revenge. Note  that  this
won't  take much time if the caster is still in the melee area. Other results
mean  that it leaves the area silently. The material component of this  spell
is the caster's holy symbol.

This  spell conjures up a 5 foot snow man. The snowman has 3 HD, MV  90  feet
per  round, and one attack for 2d6. It can be hit by normal weapons, and  can
freeze potions with a touch. It can put out normal fires and torches. It  can
also  cause a small snowstorm in its range (40 yard radius from priest)  that
lasts for 1d4 rounds, making all creatures in the storm blind. Any being from
the  planes  of  ice,  air, or water can destroy the snowman  with  a  touch,
including another snowman. If the snowman moves more than 40 yards away  from
the caster it will instantly melt. The material component for this spell is a
bit of snow.

A  snowball is an explosive burst of cold gas, which comes into being with  a
loud "whoosh" and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who
cast  it,  i.e.,  1d6  points per level of the wizard. The  snowball  doesn't
expend  a  considerable amount of pressure, and it will generally conform  to
the  shape of the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its
normal spherical volume (the area which is covered by the snowball is a total
volume of roughly 33000 cubic feet).
Besides causing damage to the target, the snowball freezes all liquids within
its radius. Items exposed to the spell's effects must make a saving throw  to
avoid being affected. Items with a creature which makes its saving throw  are
considered  to  be unaffected. The wizard points his finger  and  speaks  the
range  (distance and height) at which the snowball is to come into  being.  A
streak  flashes from the pointing digit and unless it impacts upon a material
body prior to attaining the pre-described range, blossoms into the snowball.
If  creatures  fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point  damage
from  the spell. Those who make their saving throw manage to dodge, fall flat
or  roll aside, and thus take only half damage from the effect of the  spell.
The  material component of this spell is a hollow crystal filled with  water;
suspended in the water are tiny white quartz flakes (cf. fireball).

      Casting this cantrip removes all effects of alcohol from the wizard  or
any  one  other  person  he touches. It also instantly cures  hangovers.  The
material  component  is a fresh lemon, whose juice must be  squeezed  on  the
wizard's  fingers before the casting. Unwilling targets are granted a  saving
throw  versus  spell.  The duration of this cantrip is permanent,  until  the
subject  gets  drunk  again. If the spell is cast on the  wizard  himself,  a
saving throw at -5 is required, since concentration is very difficult.
      The reverse cantrip, drunkenness, makes the wizard or his chosen target
drunk  for  about  an hour with no hangover. The wizard must  wave  his  hand
before  the  chosen targets eyes for the spell to take effect.  The  material
component is a sip of alcoholic drink.

This spell causes a reflective surface to serve as a scrying device for up to
one  hour as long as the sun is above the horizon   the caster must  look  at
the  sun in this reflective surface for the duration of the spell. The caster
can only see things directly exposed to the rays of the sun. For example,  if
the  caster is scrying a caravan crossing the sandy wastes, he could see  the
riders  and wagons but not inside covered wagons. Now suppose the  driver  of
the  first wagon throws its tarp back, directly exposing 5 square feet of the
cargo to the sun. Even though the entire inside of the wagon might be lit  by
diffused light, the caster could only see where the rays of the sun  hit;  he
can  not  see anything that does not lay within that 5 square feet of  direct
sunlight.
In all respects, the reflective surface behaves as a crystal ball, except the
following. This spell can not be used when the caster is not in sunlight, and
the  chance of locating the subject is 0% when the subject is not exposed  to
the  same  sun  that the caster is using (such as on another  prime  material
plane).  Viewing  period and frequency limits apply across all  surfaces  the
caster  uses.  Thus,  given a 75% chance of finding the subject,  the  caster
would have a 30 minute viewing period twice per day. If he used a mirror  for
two viewing periods and switched to polished steel for a third, he would risk
insanity  for  exceeding his allotted frequency as detailed  in  the  Dungeon
Master's Guide.
A priest in good standing with the powers of the elemental plane of fire will
suffer no ill effects from this spell, and it will work normally. One who  is
not  on  good  standing will suffer retinal damage automatically  (no  saving
throw  allowed), becoming blind, and the spell will fail. Since  this  latter
effect burns the victims retina, a cure blindness spell will not restore  his
sight;  rather,  stronger magic must be used, such as a restoration  or  wish
spell.
The  material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol  and  any
highly reflective surface (mirror, polished metal, clear water); neither  are
consumed.

By  means  of this spell, the wizard creates an illusory sonic blast  by  the
clap  of his hands which is capable of deafening and stunning creatures which
fail  their  saving  throws.  Once  the direction  and  arc  are  determined,
creatures  nearest  the  wizard are affected first,  each  one  draining  the
illusory  magic from the spell until its power is expired. Creatures  failing
their  saving  throw  are stunned for 1d4 rounds, however,  on  a  successful
Intelligence check those failing the original saving throw are able  to  run,
but not fight. The number of creatures which may be affected is as follows:

     Hit Dice  # Affected     Hit Dice  # Affected

When this spell is cast, the wizard blows on a conch shell and sends forth  a
sonic  blast  that  does 1d4+1 points of damage per level.  The  sonic  blast
issues  forth in a 10-foot diameter cylinder with a distance of  5  feet  per
level of the caster. Any item, door, etc. caught in the blast needs to make a
saving throw versus crushing blow to remain intact.

The  material component of this spell is a conch shell that is consumed  when
the  blast is released. The blast of this spell uses the water as a  carrier,
making it only possible to cast underwater.

With  this  spell, the wizard is able to take control any small  (size  Tiny)
creature of 1 or less Hit Dice in his line of sight. If the creature is above
animal Intelligence, it gets a saving throw versus spell, a successful saving
throw  indicating spell failure. The creature is at -4 to save if the  wizard
has  a good grip on it during the spell's casting. Those creatures of a  non-
magical  nature of less then animal Intelligence do not get a  saving  throw.
Those of a magical nature get a saving throw at 4.
Once  the  wizard has control of the animal, while concentrating he can  see,
hear,  etc.,  through the animal's senses. He can also control  the  animal's
actions,  even  special  movement, such as flying,  swimming  and  burrowing,
although  the if the wizard attempts to get the creature to attack  something
not  below itself on the food chain, the animal has a (75 minus the  wizard's
level)  percent chance of escaping the grip of the spell. While concentrating
on the animal, the wizard is incapable of any other action.
The wizard can maintain control of the animal up to 100 yards away, per level
of  the  wizard. Those seeing the controlled animal will notice  any  strange
behaviour  it  may  be  exhibiting, if they make the  appropriate  perception
checks  (i.e.,  an Intelligence check, or saving throw versus  paralysation).
The  spell  is  broken if the wizard ceases concentration, or if  the  animal
takes  more  than 4 HP of damage. Otherwise, the spell lasts for a  turn  per
three  levels  of  the wizard (i.e., two turns at fourth, three  at  seventh,
etc.).

The material component of the spell is a bit of food, which the target animal
would find appetizing, which is consumed by the wizard in the casting of  the
spell.

This  spell  creates a spying device out of an ordinary flying  insect.  Upon
casting  the  spell  upon an insect, living or dead,  the  spell  grants  the
abilities  of limited clairaudience and clairvoyance, centred on the  insect.
The  wizard, while concentrating on the insect, can hear any noise within  15
feet  of  the  insect. Clairvoyance through the insect,  however,  is  rather
disorientating, and the wizard is at penalties of -2 to-hit  and  +2  to  his
Armour Class for three rounds after breaking concentration. The insect has  a
flying   movement  rate  of  6,  and  its  movement  is  controlled  by   the
concentrating wizard.
If  concentration  is broken before the end of the spell  duration,  the  fly
drops  to  the ground, and there is a 75% chance that, if the wizard  resumes
concentration,   it  will  be  too  damaged  to  fly  again,   although   the
clairaudience  and  clairvoyance will still work for  the  remainder  of  the
duration. If the fly takes any damage during the spell, such as being swatted
or  stepped  on, the insect will no longer fly, but, provided that  at  least
half of the fly remains, the clairaudience and clairvoyance will still work.

The material component of the spell is the body of a winged insect, living or
dead, which is slain in the casting of the spell.

This  spell creates the illusion of a creature, up to medium in size, through
which  the  wizard  gains the advantage of a clairaudience  and  clairvoyance
spell.  The wizard must determine the appearance of the illusionary observer,
during  the  casting  of the spell. If it is a creature  the  wizard  is  not
familiar  with, observers of the illusion are at +4 to notice it as such.  If
the  wizard  has  an accurate drawing or carving of the illusionary  subject,
observers  are  at -4 to spot the illusion. Those successfully  noticing  the
illusion see it become merely become translucent, it does not disappear.  The
illusion  is incapable of making any sounds, and is completely insubstantial,
even if someone touching it is unaware that it is an illusion.
The  illusion has a movement rate of 30, and it is capable of passing through
solid  objects,  all  save lead, the touch of which cancels  the  spell.  The
wizard  must carefully concentrate on the illusion (i.e., he is incapable  of
other  actions) to use the clairaudience and clairvoyance powers, as well  as
keeping the appearance realistic. If the wizard breaks concentration for some
reason, the illusion freezes in whatever position it was in, until the wizard
resumes concentration or the spell expires.

The  material components for this spell are a bit of fleece, and  a  humanoid
eye and ear.

Using this spell, the wizard is able to determine the general direction of  a
creature  within one mile plus one mile per three levels of the wizard  above
first  (two-mile  range  at  fourth level,  three  at  seventh,  etc.).  This
direction  sense  lasts  for the duration of the  spell,  regardless  of  the
movement  of the wizard, or the creature. If the distance between the  wizard
and  the target should exceed the maximum range (target teleports, etc.), the
spell is broken.
If  the wizard comes within three feet of the object of the spell, he gets  a
sharp  headache. If the wizard actually touches the object of the spell,  the
spell is broken.

The  material component of this spell is some item which was in contact  with
the creature, up to the wizard's level in turns previously.

With this spell, the wizard is able to illuminate the tracks of any being  of
which he has a some item that was in contact with the being a number of turns
equal  to  the wizard's level previously. The item could be anything  from  a
shirt,  to a scrap of hair, or drop of blood. The tracks are only visible  to
the wizard, and only tracks within the area of effect are visible.
The  spell  only illuminates tracks within the spell's area of effect  (which
moves  with  the  wizard), and will only illuminate tracks made  on  a  solid
surface (i.e., if the being being tracked took to flight, or dove into water,
the  trail would end there). However, if the wizard is able to reach the spot
where  the trail was resumed (i.e., the being being tracked wades  out  of  a
river at a certain spot), the wizard may resume tracking.
It  is up to the wizard to determine which direction leads to the most recent
tracks (i.e., which are coming and which are going), although the spell  does
illuminate a "footprint" of the being which is being tracked. The spell  will
allow the wizard to track the being if it climbed walls, and even if it tried
to  obscure  its path, by throwing dirt over it. Objects over 3 inches  thick
covering the path, however, do obscure it.

The  material component of the spell is some thing which had been in  contact
with  the  creature  to  be  tracked, up  to  the  wizard's  level  in  turns
previously. Once the spell is cast, the wizard need not carry the  item  with
him.

This  spell  summons minor etherlings from the ethereal plane, to  serve  the
wizard's  wishes. Etherlings, being rather stupid and weak, are  only  suited
for  simple  tasks, such as spying. Upon summoning the creatures, the  wizard
must  detail,  in simple language, what service he wishes the  etherlings  to
perform. The etherlings, in their stupidity, will be honoured by the  request
for  service,  and will perform the task to the best of their  abilities  and
comprehension.
A minor etherling (AC 2, MV 60, 2 HD, #AT 1, damage 1d3), is a small, vaguely
humanoid  appearing creature, formed of the stuff of the plane  ethereal.  On
the  prime  material  plane,  it appears as a hazy,  humanoid-shaped  ghostly
apparition,  about  3 feet tall. It moves by flying, and is  unobstructed  by
walls  and solid objects, save lead, the touch of which sends it back to  the
ethereal  plane.  It  is fairly stupid (Intelligence 5),  although  extremely
talkative,  and puppyish in its affection towards the wizard.  The  etherling
will do its best to please the wizard, to the point of becoming annoying.  It
does have some special abilities, making it particularly useful, however.  It
has a photographic memory, and will never forget what it saw and heard during
its period of service. It also has the ability to turn small objects (one  at
a  time),  weighing less than five pounds, ethereal, allowing it to transport
the  item. It can also turn itself invisible at will, although those able  to
see  onto the ethereal plane will be able to see it clearly. It can push  its
movement  rate  up  to 120, for up to a turn at a time. It  can  only  attack
things  on the ethereal plane, and even there not very effectively.  Finally,
the fact that it only partially exists on the prime material plane during the
spell means that it is only hit by magic weapons, and spells.
The spell summons one etherling per three levels of the wizard, one at first,
two  at fourth, three at seventh, etc. Twizard can detail separate tasks  for
each  individual etherling summoned, and may cast the spell  more  than  once
during  its duration (allowing him to summon a virtual horde), as  the  spell
requires   no   concentration  after  the  initial  casting.  An  etherling's
instructions  can  be  facilitated by pictures (as in  "Follow  this  (point)
man...  The  one in the painting" or "Follow her (point)... The one  in  this
Phantasmal Force"). It is up to the DM to decide the chance of the  etherling
getting  confused, and screwing up the task. I suggest that  it  has  a  100%
chance of getting the task right, -3% for each word in the description (i.e.,
10  words, 70% chance), giving a bonus for things such as pictures, and other
helpful  examples.  If the etherling should encounter any mentally  straining
problems,  such  as  if  its "mark" (he whom it is tailing  or  spying  upon)
teleports  away, or disguises its features, casts illusions,  etc.,  make  an
Intelligence  check  for the etherling, modified by  the  situation.  If  the
etherling  fails,  it  is hopelessly confused, and returns  to  the  ethereal
plane.  The  wizard must take care to give the etherling tasks which  it  can
complete  within the duration of the spell, as the etherling returns  to  the
ethereal plane at the end of the spells duration.
Some examples of tasks given to etherlings would be "go to the chamber at the
end  of the hall, stay there, and return to me in 20 minutes, to tell me what
you heard and saw", "go to this room in the tower of the castle, and bring me
back a book that looks like this...", "find this man, follow him for half  an
hour,  and return to me, telling me what you witnessed", "find this  man  and
tell  him  Va  banque. The game is thick", or similar things. Etherlings  are
intelligent  enough to follow the spirit of the commands, provided  they  are
simple enough. Etherlings have an innate sense of direction, and will not get
lost  on  the prime material plane. They have the mental abilities  of  young
children. They will only perform service on the material plane.

The  material  components  of the spell are small  figurines,  one  for  each
etherling  to be summoned. They must be fairly detailed, and are consumed  in
the casting of the spell.

This  spell  summons a major etherling from the ethereal  plane,  to  do  the
wizard's  bidding.  Major  etherlings are fairly intelligent,  although  they
still  suffer  from summoner-awe. The wizard summons one etherling  per  five
levels,  for  example  two  at sixth, three at eleventh,  etc.  The  summoned
etherlings  are  eager  to serve the wizard, and they  are  capable  of  more
complicated tasks than their lesser brethren.
A major etherling (AC 0, MV 60, HD 4, #AT 2, damage 1d3/1d3, Int 12) is a man-
sized,  transparent, humanoid-appearing creature, formed of the stuff of  the
plane ethereal. It has some control over its appearance on the prime material
plane,  although,  regardless of form, they have  blurry  outlines,  and  are
partially  transparent. It also moves by flight, although it is sophisticated
enough  to give the illusion of walking. Being mostly on the ethereal  plane,
it  is able to pass through solid objects, save lead, the touch of which,  if
it  fails  a  saving throw versus paralysation, returns it  to  the  ethereal
plane,  cancelling  the spell. Major etherlings are fairly  intelligent,  and
have a 20% chance of knowing any specific minor lore, although it will answer
such  a  question only once. A major etherling will be stricken with  extreme
respect  for  the  summoner, and will attempt to follow  the  spirit  of  its
commands to the best of its ability. It has the ability to turn small  items,
of  less  than  ten pounds in weight, ethereal, allowing it to transport  the
item.  It  may  only carry one such item at a time, however. It  also  has  a
photographic memory.
Major  etherlings are capable of performing complicated tasks, and can  grasp
abstract  concepts. Once given a task, it will remain on the  prime  material
plane  until  the task is complete, or its time runs out. One  advantage  the
major etherling possess over its lesser brethren, however, is its ability  to
move  into  the  ethereal  plane, and return to  the  prime  material  plane,
essentially  teleporting.  It is also capable  of  completing  tasks  on  the
ethereal  plane, as well as the prime material. Again, an Intelligence  check
is  required for particularly baffling problems encountered in its task,  and
if  the  task  is rendered somehow impossible to complete, and the  etherling
makes  it  Int  check, it will return to the wizard, and inform  him  of  the
problem, before returning to the ethereal plane, for good.
Being dual-plane beings, they are only hit by magic weapons, and spells.  The
material  components of this spell are jade figurines, one for each etherling
to be summoned.

This spell allows the wizard to mimic the actions of a creature, provided the
actions occurred within a number of turns equal to the wizard's level. During
the  casting of the spell, the wizard must touch some object which the target
creature was in contact with for at least a round, and that contact must  not
have  occurred more than the wizard's level in hours previously (this  object
is not consumed in the casting).
Upon  casting the spell, the wizard goes into a trance, during which he loses
all  control  of  his actions (save versus spell at -4 to break  spell),  and
begins  mimicking the most recent actions of the target, provided the actions
occurred  within the area of effect. The spell does not allow the  wizard  to
mimic  actions  of which he is incapable, such as climbing  walls,  or  broad
jumping  20  feet, and the wizard merely imitates any spells the  target  may
have  cast,  and  doesn't  actually cast the spell  (although  observers  may
recognise  the  spell he is attempting to cast). If the target did  something
which  would  take it outside of the area of effect, such as  rapid  movement
beyond the abilities of the wizard, or teleportation, the spell is broken.
The  wizard must decide how far back in time he would like to begin mimicking
the  actions  of  the target. The actions of the target may take  the  wizard
beyond the original area of effect, but there is a 10-foot radius sphere over
which is determined whether or not the target left the area of effect.
The  wizard has the option of casting such movement spells as fly and feather
fall,  prior  to  trance, to facilitate movement such as climbing,  and  even
flying,  and to take the pain out of such actions as falling (if  the  target
was a clutz). The target must be man sized, and humanoid.
The  wizard's trance will be broken by such things as da slapping, and  other
unpleasant stimuli.

When this spell functions normally, it transports the soul of the caster into
another  individual, while sending the victims soul beyond the astral  plane;
into the void.
Upon  casting  this  spell,  the wizard attempts to  move  his  soul  (mental
capabilities,  class, alignment, experience, Intelligence, and  Wisdom)  from
his  old body into another. If successful, the new body of the wizard has the
following statistics:

Strength: from victim
Intelligence: from wizard
Wisdom: from wizard
Dexterity: from victim
Constitution: from victim
Charisma: averaged (round down)
Comeliness: from victim, modified by new Charisma

The  only saving throw that the victim receives is based on his saving  throw
versus  death magic, and his level. The base chance of saving is 1%, but  the
following table is consulted for any modifiers to the saving throw:

Condition Modifier
For every level     +1%
For every level above name    +2%
For every point between 20 and the
  victim's saving throw versus death magic   +2%
Victim is an immortal    +50%

If the victim's percentage saving throw is successful, the following table is
consulted:

     D100 Roll Effect of Spell
      01-12      Caster permanently loses 1d3 points of constitution and  all
souls remain in previous bodies
      13    Soul of wizard attempts to inhabit nearest living creature larger
than one pound
     14-73     Spell has no effect
     74-82     The wizard's alignment changes to that of the intended victim,
if not already. No saving throw.
      83-93     1d4 spells that are memorised by the wizard are stripped from
his  memory  and  placed in the mind of the victim. If the victim  is  not  a
wizard, the spell has no effect.
      94-00      The experiences, knowledge, level, Intelligence, and  Wisdom
are  transferred  to  the victim and mixed with what is  already  there.  The
caster is then brain dead.

The outcome of the 94-00 determinate is where the intended victim retains his
physical attributes while attaining an Intelligence and Wisdom equal  to  the
higher  of  the two individuals involved, plus 2. Furthermore,  the  intended
victim  becomes a wizard of the caster's level, regardless of race, with  the
spell  inventory of the caster. If the intended victim is already  a  wizard,
the  caster's experience is added to the intended victim's, and the  caster's
spell list is added to the victim's, up to the maximum number of spells  that
the  victim's Intelligence allows him to hold. Finally, the alignment of  the
victim shifts to the average of the two individuals' previous alignments.  If
the  caster and victim's alignments are an uneven amount of places apart, the
newly  created  mind's  alignment will be closer to  the  victim's  than  the
caster's.  It  is  important to note that the new mind  within  the  intended
victim is not schizophrenic, but rather it is a modified continuation of  the
victim's  original consciousness. The consciousness of the casting wizard  is
forever gone.

The  material  components  for the spell are a 6-inch  thread  of  silver,  2
powdered  mindflayer  testicles, and the true name  of  the  intended  victim
inscribed on any demon skull.

With this spell, a necromancer stores the soul of the recipient in a piece of
jet,  the  material component. While his soul is thus protected, a  character
suffers  a penalty of -2 to attack rolls and saving throws, he does not  heal
naturally, and magical healing functions on him at only half normal efficacy.
If  the  character is slain by undead while under the effects of this  spell,
however,  his  soul cannot be corrupted and forced to rise as  undead  itself
(though the body can still be animated as a zombie or skeleton). If the  soul
safe is destroyed, or if the spell expires, the soul will return (across  any
distance)  to  its  body, unless that body is dead, in  which  case  it  will
journey to its final resting place. This spell affects only races with souls:
dwarves, halflings, and humans.

The spell will ignite the soul of the target creature, and try to fry it from
within  until  it  dies. The spell gives out no visible effects  besides  the
obvious  pain of the target creature. For obvious reasons, this  spell  works
only  for living creatures who have a soul. The damage that is inflicted will
be  3d6  during the first round, and 2d6 on each subsequent rounds after  the
first. The casting of this spell will exhaust the caster for equal amount  of
rounds  that  the spell lasts, requiring an Intelligence check to concentrate
on  anything  specific  other  than standing,  sitting,  walking  slowly,  or
resting.

To  cast the spell, the wizard places a number of currant seeds (the material
components)  near  the sound source. Half way through the  spell  the  wizard
ceases  his  chanting. All of the sounds created between this point  and  the
time  the  wizard resumes chanting become the sound pattern  to  repeat.  The
maximum  duration  of the sound pattern is up to 1 second per  level  of  the
wizard. The actual duration is the length of the pattern times the number  of
currant  seeds, provided this is less than the maximum time. The  sound  need
not be created by the wizard.
When  the spell casting has ended, the sound pattern is repeated continuously
until  all  the  currant seeds are used. It is repeated at the  same  decibel
level as the original sound.

choice, the spell can work in one of 2 Ways:
           No  sound can enter the bubble, and no sound can leave the bubble,
but  sound inside the bubble, and outside the bubble, stays normal. I.e., the
caster  and  a  few companions can have a nice and quiet conversation  inside
this bubble while a deafening noise is raging (whatever) outside.
           He may opt to allow sound to pass in or out through the bubble, or
both  or  none. He can change the function of the bubble anytime  before  the
duration  ends,  but  this  version  of the  spell  requires  the  caster  to
concentrate  the  whole  time he want to maintain the  bubble.  The  bubble's
function  can be changed once per round. Also this version of the spell  have
to be centred on the caster.
This spell will proof safety to sound based attacks, but each such attack has
a  cumulative 15% chance of bursting the bubble. I.e., the first attack has a
15%  chance, the second has a 30 percent chance, etc. Note that the  attacker
can walk into the bubble, and then attack those inside the bubble, and anyone
outside won't hear the sound or attack.
Wizards and priests can cast spells with verbal components inside the bubble,
but if the spell uses a sound based effect, those sounds will not be able  to
pass through the bubble. If the sound originates from an illusion outside the
bubble, one won't be able to hear it inside the bubble. How the ventriloquism
spell  is to be handled, when cast inside the bubble, is left up to  the  DM.
Ask him beforehand how he will handle it.
If you want to cast the spell on an unwilling recipient (for example, someone
with  a  horn  of disruption), he is allowed a saving throw versus  spell  to
negate the spell.

The material component of this spell is a tiny triangle.

This  spell  can be cast on a room or open space with an area no larger  than
160  square feet, and which is near another room or space of equal or  lesser
area.  The second space must be no further than 30 feet away from the  first,
and  may  not contain any extradimensional devices or gates (if it does,  the
spell  will  fail,  and there is a 25% chance that the device  or  gate  will
explode,  causing  4d10 points of damage to all within a 20  foot  radius;  a
saving throw versus spell will reduce this damage in half). After the initial
round  of  casting, the two areas will begin to blend - that is,  the  spaces
they  occupy will begin to overlap. Occupants of both areas will witness  the
same  thing: 1 round after the spell is cast, everything from the other  area
will appear as a vague and transparent image, possibly even overlapping solid
objects  and creatures. During the next two rounds, the images will begin  to
solidify,  moving aside any objects or people that they are overlapping.  If,
for any reason, it is not possible to move an object with a reasonable amount
of  force  (walls,  floors,  and  ceilings  fall  into  this  category),  the
overlapping  image  will remain transparent until the  spell  is  over.  This
phenomenon  will  affect the second area as well, although objects  from  the
first  room will appear to occupy its space. After 3 rounds, all objects  and
creatures will be solid (within the limits of the spell) and can interact  as
if  they  were  in the same space. During this entire time, the  caster  must
remain  still  and  concentrate  deeply, or the  spell  will  immediately  be
negated.  The  two  spaces  will stay blended  for  as  long  as  the  caster
concentrates  on  the spell, up to a maximum duration of 1  turn  per  caster
level.  If the caster voluntarily stops the spell, he will have 1d20  seconds
in which to grab an object or creature from the other space, thereby bringing
it  back with him into his space. Otherwise, everything that was in the first
space  remains  there,  and everything that was in the second  space  returns
there.  The material components are two squares of cloth, sewn one on top  of
the other, which are consumed in the casting.

      When  this  cantrip is cast, a shower of sparks sprays forth  from  the
wizard's  hand.  These sparks are harmless unless cast  in  the  presence  of
highly flammable or explosive substances.

      Creatures particularly susceptible to fire damage, such as trolls, may,
at  the  DM's  option, suffer a point or two of damage from the sparks.  Such
injury can be avoided with a successful saving throw versus breath weapon  at

This  spell is similar in operation to the 3rd-level priest spell. The wizard
must  have  the majority of the remains of the body, including  the  head  or
skull.  The dead are as evasive as possible when questioned. Though the  dead
cannot tell outright lies, they will tell half-truths or be very cryptic. The
dead  will have great though not total knowledge of the wizard and his  goals
(the  DM  should assume that whatever he knows, the dead person also  knows).
This spell is more powerful than the priest spell, but the dead tend to be as
unhelpful  as possible. Even dead people who agree with the necromancer  will
dislike being summoned. This spell cannot be cast more than once per month on
any  single creature, and any creature summoned more than once in  any  given
year by the same necromancer receives a +3 to its saving throw.

This  spell empowers the priest to comprehend and communicate with any person
that  is  intoxicated.  The  priest is able  to  ask  questions  and  receive
intelligent   answers   that  may  still  be  friendless,   cooperative,   or
understanding.  The  true  usefulness of the spell is  when  the  intoxicated
person is comatose.
A  spell  or  power of this sort could make the priest a very valuable  party
commodity for his ability to interrogate those who require so much alcohol to
loosen their tongues that it also shuts down most of their brains.

When specialisation is cast, a small part of his god's power is invested into
the  priest.  This  power allows the priest to fight better  in  combat.  The
benefit  the priest receives is specialisation in the god's preferred weapon,
if the god has one. Otherwise, the benefits apply to a weapon of the priest's
choice.  This  specialisation occurs whether or not the priest is  proficient
with  the  weapon.  There  are  no  minuses  to  hit  because  of  non-weapon
proficiency  penalties. The material component of this spell is  a  miniature
version of the god's preferred weapon.
Note:  priests  tend to be proficient with their own god's preferred  weapon.
This spell is typical a spell given to priests of warrior gods.

This  spell is similar to the speed plant growth spell   it causes an  animal
to  grow  at an astonishing speed up to one year per level within one  round.
The  creature  matures,  grows and ages at the accelerated  speed  until  the
priest halts the growth. After that the creature stays in the cycle at  which
the  priest  left  it (a bear might start to hibernate at  the  beginning  of
spring, wake up in the middle of fall, and wake throughout the winter).  This
might  cause some major problems for the priest if he does not care  for  the
animals he thus rips out of nature's order. The animal gains a maximum of one
hit  point  per die per 5 levels of the priest up to the maximum  effect.  If
this  spell  is used carefully (once per week with a maximum of an additional
week  each  during 6 months), a creature may be bred, which has a 50%  higher
amount of Hit Dice than normal (thus, a cave bear with 6+6 HD might now  have
9+9 HD). If the creature is unwilling it gains a saving throw. Note: a priest
should  not  try to use this spell on an unwilling animal as that  will  most
certainly  cause  some  dire consequences for him. The reverse,  stop  animal
growth,  completely  stops  the natural growth of  an  animal,  although  the
animal's  natural lifetime is not changed. This spell and its reverse  cancel
one another.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest plus a  potion  of
growth  and  a potion of animal control (the potion of growth for the  animal
and the potion of animal control for the priest).

This  spell  doubles the number of spells a spell caster can  cast  during  a
single  combat round: normally, a wizard can cast a maximum of one spell  per
round;  now he can cast two. It does not allow one person to read two  spells
from  a  scroll  in  one  round, nor does it  allow  two  uses  of  the  same
triggerable  item  in one round nor does it allow the use of  two  items  per
round  which could not normally be uwithin one round, etc. It only  works  on
actually  cast spells (spell-like natural or magical abilities are  not  sped
up),  and  any physical attacks are not sped up - thus it is no good  if  you
cast  two touch spells in one round if they have to be used in the same round
and you have only one attack per round. The effect of this spell sets in with
a  one  round  delay: cast speed casting in round number 1 and  start  double
speed  casting in round number 2 (sorry, no additional spell in round  number
1).
Only spells which have initiative modifiers can be sped-cast. Both spells  to
be  cast  in the same round have to be of the kind with initiative modifiers.
Like the haste spell, this spell offers a -2 bonus for the initiative roll of
the  character - but only for cast spells. Thus, casting times  of  zero  are
possible. This spell is cumulative with alacrity. First, alacrity's effect is
used  and  then  the  -2 bonus of this spell is applied. This  spell  is  not
cumulative with itself or any other speed increasing methods. The  method  of
initiative is easy: roll 1d10, take the result, add the normal casting  time,
subtract the bonus (-2), allow for a 1-point initiative penalty, then add the
second casting time. For example, cast fireball twice in one round: a roll of
4;  add  3  (for fireball), subtract 2 (bonus): boom number one at initiative
modifier 5; add 1-point penalty (wait for the battery recharge), add  3  (for
the second fireball): boom number two at moment 9.
The  reversed  spell,  slow casting (which needs a to-hit  roll  in  combat),
forces  the  touched being to save versus spell. If this saving throw  fails,
that  creature  needs double the time to cast a spell and a  maximum  of  one
spell  per two rounds could be cast - if it normally were to be cast  in  one
round or less. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens and the spell is
wasted.

The material component is a speed potion quaffed by the recipient. The potion
does not have its usual effects except to age the drinker one year.

By  the use of this spell, a priest may speed the fermentation process of any
naturally  fermentable  vegetable  matter (grapes,  potatoes,  wheat,  etc.).
Within  one hour, all contents of the container will be completely  fermented
as  if  the full year (or whatever the necessary time period is) has  passed.
The priest must be careful to make sure that all other preparations have been
made  to  hold  the newly fermented liquid. There must be vats,  bottles  and
anything else that is necessary for the preservation of the alcohol.
The  priest  must already be knowledgeable about the processes involved  with
fermentation,  know the time necessary to ferment the grapes  (or  whatever),
and  know  the  alcohol-making  processes  before  casting  this  spell  (the
character must have a proper nonweapon proficiency).
The material component is a bit of already fermented material.

This spell causes a single plant (or an area of plants of 200 square feet per
level if small, grass-like plants) to grow at an astonishing speed. It can be
caused  to  grow  one year per level of the caster in one  round  only.  This
growth  is like natural growth. It can be interrupted at any time within  the
growth  by  the caster. Once the growth reaches its end, the plant  stays  in
that  cycle  even if completely out of tune with the cycles of nature.  Thus,
this  spell  could  cause an apple tree to green, carry blossoms,  and  fruit
within one round, even if within the deepest of winter. Once the time of  the
plant  has been changed by the spell it stays in that cycle. Thus, our  apple
tree  would  from  now on would start to green within the latest  of  autumn,
carry blossoms within the winter and carry fruit in the middle of spring. The
reverse,  stop plant growth, completely stops the natural growth of a  plant,
although  the  plant's natural lifetime is not changed. This  spell  and  its
reverse cancel one another.
The  material component for this spell is an old oak's bark. This  bark  must
still contain some life from the oak, thus it cannot be very old. In addition
the priest needs his holy symbol.

Any  undead  failing  its saving throw versus spell will find  itself  taking
double damage from all attacks, as its binding forces are less powerful  now.
The  spell can be reversed to have the opposite effect of enabling an  undead
to take only half damage. This is called slow rot. The material component for
this spell is a dead mouse steeped in fruit juice.

The  power  allows  the  psionicist to move  at  twice  the  usual
movement rate, attack at the next highest level on the "attack/rnd
chart,"  and perform any physical action in half the ustime.   The
armor class is also reduced by 1.
      Using  this power for longer than 5 rounds has a  chance  of
aging  the character.  This chance is a cumulative 10% per  round.
The  psionicist can avoid this by stopping the power for at  least
two rounds before re-initiating it once more.

Power  Score:  Speed is tripled with regards to physical  activity
and movement.  Attacks remain unchanged.

This  spell  is  an  improvement to the shadow magic  and  demi-shadow  magic
spells.  This spell can simulate any attack spell of seventh level  or  lower
with quasi-real effects.
If  the  spells  quoted  in  the  shadow magic  or  demi-shadow  magic  spell
descriptions are chosen, they function as follows:
If  the attacked beings try to disbelieve the spell, they get a saving  throw
against  the  illusion, but no other saving throws (except magic resistance).
If they succeed, the spell still causes a minimum of 3 points per die (reroll
any  one's or two's). If they fail, they take the damage like those  who  did
not try to disbelieve and failed their saving throw. Those who did not try to
disbelieve  take the maximum damage possible by the spell if they fail  their
saving  throws  against the normally applicable spell.  If  they  make  their
saving  throws  they take their usually applicable damage  (reduced  by  fire
resistance, cold resistance, etc.).
If  a  spell is simulated that is not mentioned in the shadow magic or  demi-
shadow  magic spell descriptions, it functions as normal unless the  affected
being  tries  to disbelieve. In that case that person has to  make  a  saving
throw  versus spell. If it succeeds, the spell causes only one hit point  per
die  of quasi-real damage. If it fails, that creature takes the usual damage.
Note:  this spell is so high powered that it can affect even undead  who  are
normally immune to illusions.

The  material component of this spell is the material component of the  spell
to be duplicated plus a silver mirror which has tarnished over time.

This  spell allows a caster to catch up to one spell level in spells per  two
caster  levels  in  the  duration of this spell. The  caught  spells  can  be
launched by the caster as if he had cast them at that time (even if a  wizard
uses  this  to catch and cast a priest spell). Any spells can be caught  with
this spell - even those spells only transmitted by touch. The wizard does not
know  what  spell he catches unless he succeeds at a spellcraft check  if  he
sees  or  hears  the opposing caster during the casting of the  spell  to  be
caught. Any caught spells can be released by a mental order (up to one  spell
per  round), in addition to another spell cast or another action taken by the
caster  of the spell catcher. If the caster tries to catch a spell with  more
spell levels than he has available, he receives the full maximum effect  with
no  saving  throw (any saving throws are automatically failed) of that  spell
plus  any spells stored in the spell catcher at their normal effects. If  the
duration  runs  out (or the magic is dispelled) and there  are  spells  still
remaining  in  the spell catcher the same thing happens with  all  spells  at
their  maximum  effect.  This is due to the massive draining  effect  on  the
caster:  any  spells that remained in the caster's mind at  the  end  of  the
duration  of  the spell catcher will be drained completely and  he  needs  to
rememorise them.

The  material component is a memory moss, which is fully intact (at full  hit
points),  impregnated with a very weak acid containing the dissolved  remains
of  the book covers of at least five books which have contained well over 100
pages  of arcane knowledge. It is possible to reuse the same book with always
replaced covers, but to repair such a book cost a lot (at least 1000  gp  per
cover).

This  spell  allows  the caster of spells to connect the effects  of  certain
spells.  The spells have to be spells with initiative modifiers; the  sum  of
their  initiative modifiers has to be no greater than 30; and the spells  are
not  allowed  to  have  conflicting effects (it's  impossible  to  connect  a
fireball with a cone of cold, or a fear with a charm).
Under these restrictions, the casting times of all spells are added and  then
multiplied  by  the number of spells. The resulting number is the  initiative
modifier  unless the number is ten or greater. If that happens  the  combined
spell  has  a  casting  time  of one round per 10 full  units  of  initiative
modifiers plus the remaining modifier (three spells are connected to  have  a
full  15  modifier;  this would change into a 1 round casting  time  with  an
additional  5  modifier  the next round). It is not possible  to  reduce  the
casting times of these spells by any means. Any spells or items which cause a
reduction of casting times will fail in reducing these casting times.
The  recipient  of this spell gains one spell level per caster  level.  These
spell  levels may be used to connect spell effects. Once they are used up  or
one hour per caster level has passed the spell connector ends. It is possible
to  layer up to three spell levels per caster level into one creature. All of
these  spell levels have to be gained from one caster. Another caster  cannot
offer any more spell levels.
The  effects  of connected spells are determined by the DM, but  here  is  an
indication:  cast a sleep, charm person, and forget connected at  6  kobolds.
This  would mean (1+1+2 = 4x3 = 12 = 1 round + 2 casting time). If this spell
succeeds they would most probably all go to sleep (as the sleep spell has  no
saving throw) and be likewise immediately charmed, but they would also forget
who had cast spells against them.

The  material  components are the material components of  the  spells  to  be
connected,  which are all contained in a glass sphere (one sphere  per  spell
component (V, S, M). For the verbal components a scroll is necessary  (not  a
magical  scroll)  containing the sounds and words  of  the  spells,  for  the
somatic  components  the sphere has to contain a scroll describing  the  hand
movements and body motions, and the sphere for the material components has to
contain the material components of the spells. The spheres may have hinges or
screw-on caps, so they may be opened. The glass balls have to be connected by
a  thin silver wire which has to be wrapped around the glass spheres. As this
takes some time, the casting times of the spells might be increased even more
unless  one  knows far ahead which spells one wishes to cast with this  spell
connector.

When the wizard casts this spell he is able to use the non-weapon proficiency
spell  craft  with  100% accuracy. He is able to tell exactly  what  spell  a
wizard  or priest is casting, no matter what level the spell, type of  spell,
or  nature  of the spell. He is also able to discern the intended effects  of
the  spell. A wizard that has cast spell tell and wishes to determine  spells
other  wizards are casting is penalised in the initiative roll. He may freely
view one wizard and take whatever other action he wishes, but for each wizard
over one that he observes, the wizard is at another +1 to his initiative. For
example, the wizard rolls a 5 for initiative, he views 3 wizards to determine
what spells they are casting, then his modified initiative roll is an 8.

This  spell,  which  was  researched by Grimbor, distorts  the  three  normal
dimensions  with  respect to magic spells directed at the wizard.  Any  spell
cast  at the wizard will usually rebound, in part or perhaps in full. When  a
spell  is  directed at the wizard, percentile dice are rolled and rounded  to
the  nearest decimal, i.e., 1-5 is dropped, 6-9 adds 10, so 05 equals 0%  but
96  equals 100%. The score of the percentile dice indicates what portion  has
been  turned.  Damage  is  awarded proportionally.  Saving  throws  for  both
opponents are adjusted upward by +1 for each 10% below 100%; i.e., 80% equals
+2, 70% equals +3, ..., 10% equals +9. See the table below.
Spells  which  normally allow no saving throw may be negated or inflict  half
normal  damage if a special saving throw is made. For each 10% of  the  spell
turned,  allow  a  saving throw of 5% (1 in 20); see the  table  below.  This
special  saving  throw  is  not  modified by  race,  magic  items,  or  other
conditions.

     D100 Percentage     Saving Throw   Special
     Roll Turned    Bonus     Saving Throw
     01-05     0%   -    -
     06-15     10%  +9   20
     16-25     20%  +8   19

     36-45     40%  +6   17
     46-55     50%  +5   16
     56-65     60%  +4   15
     66-75     70%  +3   14
     76-85     80%  +2   13
     86-95     90%  +1   12
     96-00     100% -    -

Spell turning does not apply to spells which affect an area and are not  cast
directly  at the wizard, nor spells which are delivered by touch,  nor  magic
delivered by devices or at-will abilities, such as rods, staves, wands, rings
or  other  items, or monsters' abilities such as a devil's hold person  or  a
storm giant's lightning bolt.
If the attacking wizard also has spell turning, either through ring or spell,
the following table applies:

     D100 Roll Effect
     01-70     Spell drains away without effect
     71-80     Spell affects both equally at full effect
     81-97     Both spells (or spell and ring) are drained permanently
      98-00      Both  individuals are sent through a rift  to  the  positive
material plane

The material component of the spell is a small silver mirror.

By  use of this spell, the wizard magically links 4 spells that are currently
in  his  memory. The link is such that, upon uttering a trigger  phrase,  the
linked  spells are invoked almost simultaneously. That is, they are  machine-
gunned. In actual time: there is a one fifth round gap between the spells.
The spells that can be linked are, at most, one 1st-level, one 2nd-level, one
3rd-level and one 4th-level spell. The wizard must specify the order  of  the
link  (1-3-4-2,  2-1-3, etc.). Spells that are linked may not  be  cast.  Any
attempt  to  normally cast a linked spell has an 85% chance to fizzle,  minus
10%  per point of Intelligence above 15. Furthermore, the other spells linked
to the cast spell are automatically lost.
The trigger phrase takes one round to us At the end of the duration, which is
secretly rolled by the DM, this spell and the linked spells are automatically
lost.
Spell components are a braided platinum and copper chain, worth 500 gp, which
is consumed by the spell, and - obviously - whatever is needed for the linked
spells.

      With this spell, a wizard can harness and store the energy used to cast
spells for later use - to enhance other spells. This requires a crystal of at
least 100 gp worth. This crystal, once forged, is far from stable, and if not
handled  carefully, it will detonate in a wild surge. To determine whether  a
crystal detonates, roll an item saving throw as for rock (crystal) with a  -4
and  a  +1  per two levels of the caster. If magic is released (either  by  a
casting  or  by another crystal that detonates), roll a saving  throw  versus
crushing  blow  for  everything and everyone within a 1-foot  radius  of  the
crystal.

     If such a crystal is placed within the area of a stabilize spell it gets
a  +4  on  every  saving throw. Also, if a crystal does detonate  it  doesn't
release  a surge. Instead, the magic just fizzles away (this is really  handy
because  now  a  chain reaction cannot be caused). Thirdly,  the  time  spent
within a stabilized area doesn't count against the duration of the spell.

      In  a  dead magic area the energy just fizzles away. When entering  the
area,  the  crystal  must save versus disintegration or  be  rendered  normal
again.  Detonating crystals just fizzle in this area. Upon  entering  a  wild
area,  a  saving throw versus disintegration must also be made or the crystal
will  detonate.  All saving throws within this area are  at  -4  (except  the
saving throw made when entering the area).

Spellshield  is  a very special type of spell. It consists of  but  a  single
gesture,  performed with both hands as if spreading something upon the  space
before the caster. A curtain of light follows the movement, then remains  for
a  moment. Spellshield does not have to be declared at the end of the  round;
can  be done at any time. If the caster has not yet performed his action  for
the  round, spellshield takes precedence. If he has, he is given a -5 penalty
on  initiative for the next round. If he is in the middle of casting  another
spell  at the moment he wishes to use spellshield, the other spell is  broken
and  lost. The effects of spellshield are as follows: it will block any other
magic  with  a directed effect which can be intercepted with the  shield.  In
other  words, a spellshield could be used to stop a lightning bolt,  a  magic
missile,  or a ray of enfeeblement. It would not stop a fireball (unless  the
fireball was aimed directly at the caster) or a colour spray, since these are
not   purely   directed  attacks  (i.e.,  they  don't  have  a  line-effect).
Spellshield can be declared even after the spell to be blocked goes  off;  in
other  words,  the  DM says: "the wizard casts a lightning bolt  and  strikes
Syzygy...", and at this point the wizard Syzygy can say: "I'll block it  with
a  spellshield". Waiting until damage is rolled is not allowed, but this is a
DM call; if the DM said, "the wizard strikes Syzygy with a lightning bolt for
43  points of damage", Syzygy wouldn't have much choice. The caster must  see
the  enemy  spellcaster at the moment of casting; one cannot  block  a  magic
missile  from  behind with a spellshield. The shield may be  spread  only  in
front  of  the caster, and will not intercept spells aimed at anyone  besides
the  caster  himself. Both hands must be used, and nothing  may  be  held  in
either hand. The shield grants a +2 on saving throws versus gaze attacks  for
the time it is present (roughly 6 seconds) due to the slight haze of light.

This ancient and arcane spell was first found in the Libram of Tel' Aknus the
Mad. It is used to create a sphere of annihilation. The wizard must prepare a
special  magical  device, which costs 15,000 gp to construct,  to  house  the
energies required to bring the sphere into existence. The construct  is  made
of  the  rarest of ores, adamantite, and requires a full year of  work  by  a
master  smith  to  fashion. A master alchemist must then fuse  ten  vials  of
essence  of platinum, ten vials of essence of gold, and ten vials of  essence
of  silver, in this order, into the construct (which looks something  like  a
giant spider when finished). This will take two weeks per vial and the chance
of  success  is  equal  to the alchemist's chance of creating  said  essences
(checked for each vial fused to the structure) and any failure means that the
entire  structure  has been transmuted in the metal of  the  current  essence
which is being fused into the construct.
Then  the  casting procedure can take place. It consists of a  highly  ritual
ceremony requiring a black pearl of at least 1 foot in diameter being  placed
inside a magic circle and then calling forth the various magics of the planes
to  instill the pearl with anti-planar power of a sphere of annihilation. The
spell  then temporarily doubles the current hit points of the casting  wizard
as  it  starts. Every hour of casting time instills the pearl with  more  and
more  power.  At  the  end of every hour's casting the  wizard  must  roll  a
successful saving throw versus death magic which is unadjusted by  any  means
other than his current level of mastery. If successful, the casting continues
for  the  next hour. If unsuccessful, the wizard takes 1d20 points of  damage
for  an  unsuccessful hour of casting and the casting time  is  extended  for
anther  hour.  The  spell will only be successful if 12  hours  of  continual
casting  is  completed. Remember that if the spell is successful  the  wizard
must  still attempt to bring the sphere under his control. This spell  in  no
way gives any special bonuses for control attempts.
If  the  wizard  is  reduced to zero hit points the pearl  disappears  (in  a
harmless,  but spectacular flash of light) and his Strength and  Constitution
are reduced to 1 and he is thrown into a coma, losing knowledge of all spells
currently memorised. These statistics and normal hit points are regained at a
rate  of  1 point per day of total rest unless some form of magic is used  to
increase  healing. Until the wizard reaches half of his original Constitution
score  he  is  extremely susceptible to diseases and will take  4  times  the
amount  of damage a disease would normally inflict. When half of his original
Strength  is restored, he may save versus spell each day to see if  he  comes
out  of  the coma. Failure means that he remains in the coma. Once the wizard
comes  out of a coma he will be in a ravenous state and will not be  able  to
regain  spells again till he has eaten and rested for as many days as he  was
in  the  coma.  Success or failure notwithstanding, this  spell  will  always
destroy the construct and the pearl used as the material components.  If  the
spell is successful, the construct and pearl are sucked into the sphere,  and
if  unsuccessful, the construct crumbles into a useless crystal substance and
the pearl disappears as mentioned above.
If  the  wizard  is physically touched during the casting of  this  spell  by
anything,  including  the power of another magic, and sustains  damage  which
subtracts  from his hit points or any ability score or level, the pearl  will
explode in a force of magdealing out damage equal to 1d20 per hour of casting
time that has passed (rounded down) in a radius equal to 10 yards per hour of
casting  time  that  has  successfully passed  (again,  rounded  down  and  a
unmodified saving throw versus spell will allow anyone in the area of  effect
to  save  for  half  damage). Also, when this happens the  extra  hit  points
disappear  (if they are still present) and the wizard takes damage  from  his
normal remaining hit points. Death by this explosion means that the body  has
been  disintegrated, ruling out raise dead or resurrection for  bringing  the
victim back to life.

Spider call summons a variable amount of spiders to fight for the wizard. The
spiders will fight for the duration of the spell and then disappear, but they
cannot  be used for other tasks. This spell was developed by drow wizards  in
the  service  of  Lolth.  Spiders  are selected  from  the  following  table,
depending on the wizard's level:

     Wizard's Level Summoned Spiders
     5-7  large
     8-10 huge
     11-13     giant
     14+  phase

The  wizard  can summon up to 1 HD of spiders per level (drop all fractions).
Giant spiders count as five Hit Dice and phase spiders count as six. A wizard
can always summon spiders from a lower level. Only one type of spider can  be
summoned, and all remainders are lost. Giant water spiders can be summoned at
eleventh level and giant marine spiders at fourteenth. Other types of spiders
can also be summoned, at the DM's discretion.

The material component of this spell is a drop of the wizard's blood.

By  this  spell,  the  creature can walk on any surface  and  not  slip.  The
creature can walk on walls, ceilings, ice, etc., and not slip or slide  (feet
are  like  suction cups to the surface). The creature can also have one  jump
like  the  jump  spell (this is only one jump, not three like  the  1st-level
spell gives).
The  jump  does  not  include a safe landing, but by using  this  spell,  the
creature can jump up on a wall and start climbing, or climb up some wall  and
jump to a different wall.

The material components needed are: a piece of gum (tree sap, or some type of
sticky substance) and a small jumping spider (a grass hopper leg and a  piece
of spider webbing can be used as a substitute).

This  summons  one  incorporeal spirit of Hit Dice  equal  to  one  half  the
wizard's level from the astral plane. The round after it is summoned, it will
begin  to  perform  services for the wizard. In its  native  form,  it  is  a
powerful unseen servant which can go up to 100 yards from the wizard, lift 50
pounds  per Hit Die, and fly at 18. This form has a punch for 1d6  points  of
damage, AC 0, and takes one point of damage from any weapon blow.
Secondly,  it may provide animating force to a body or statue, in which  case
it  uses whatever weapons or armour are available (a stone statue will be  AC
0, damage 2d6 or by weapon, MV 9, unless affixed or possessing wings).
Thirdly,  it  may  attempt to take over the body of one enemy  creature.  The
being  so  affected is allowed a saving throw, and the spirit will be  forced
back  to  the astral plane immediately if the saving throw is successful.  If
the  saving throw fails, effects are as a domination for the duration of  the
spirit call, but the domination cannot force someone to use magic (the spirit
would  not understand the instructions). A spirit who has less than  half  of
its hit points left will be unable to possess someone.
The  spirit  can  be  forced back to the astral plane by a successful  dispel
magic, or by casting the reverse of this spell, dismiss spirit.

The material component is a piece of candy.

This  spell  enables the wizard to command a spirit or extra-planar  creature
with  a  single word. The command must be uttered in a language the  creature
can understand (or a language its creator would understand, if the spirit was
summoned).  Spirits and creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice  receive  a  saving
throw  versus spell. Summoned creatures save at the summoning wizard's  level
(if the wizard is of at least sixth level).

This  spell  creates  a  low-pitched wail, much  like  a  banshee.  The  wail
originates  at  the casters mouth and extends outward in a cone,  three  feet
long  and  one  foot  in diameter per caster level. The wail  inflicts  1d4+1
points  of  damage per two caster levels. Those killed by the wail cannot  be
raised.  Those  who fail their saving throw will also run in fear  for  1d4+1
rounds.  Eg., a 10th-level wizard casts spirit scream that does 5d4+5  points
of damage, next to invoking magical fear (no death ever occurs), with a cone-
shape area, 30 feet long and 10 feet in diameter.
The  spell  does not affect creatures without hearing organs, such as  plants
and puddings, but inflicts double damage versus crystalline. It automatically
shatters  all glass and thin crystal in its area of effect. Magical gems  and
glass must save versus disintegrate or shatter.

The  material components are a pinch of diamond dust and a small ivory  open-
ended cone.

The  spell  operates by creating an ethereal presence capable of tracking  an
enemy with complete certainty. This spirit tracker is magically linked to its
creator  in such a way that the priest becomes aware of the direction  to  an
enemy  as  soon it is located by the tracker. The tracker can find a creature
in the same plane as the priest in 2d12 turns, and can find an enemy anywhere
in 2d12 hours.
The  enemy must have in some way, mentally or physically, brought harm on the
priest or someone known to the priest. At fifth level, the priest learns  the
exact  location  as  well as the direction to the hunted creature.  At  ninth
level, the priest can actually see through the eyes of the spirit tracker.
During the operation of this spell, the tracked creature continually has  the
feeling  that  he  is being watched. If the hunted creature is  sensitive  to
ethereal  vibrations  (high level wizards, certain  creatures  of  the  outer
planes, etc.) then the spirit tracker itself may (5% chance) be seen. The 3rd-
level  wizard  spell detect scrying will reveal the location of the  tracker,
and  a dispel magic cast upon the tracker will destroy it. If the tracker  is
dispelled, the casting priest must make a saving throw versus paralysation or
sustain  1d6  points of damage and will have a tremendous  headache  for  3d6
hours  preventing the use of another spiritual tracker during that  time  and
placing the priest at  1 to hit.

This  spell  is  similar to the 2nd-level spiritual hammer and the  3rd-level
spiritual  staff.  The  caster creates a shimmering field  of  force,  shaped
vaguely like a flail. The field does damage equal to a footman's flail (2-7 S
or  M, 2-8 L). Further, it gains magical to-hit and damage bonuses in exactly
the  same  manner  as spiritual hammer and spiritual staff  (i.e.  +1  per  3
levels).
The spiritual flail strikes as a fighter of equal level to the priest casting
the spell, with weapons specialization in footman's flail. Thus, the flail is
+1  to-hit and +2 to damage due to specialization, and attacks per round  are
as follows: levels 1-6: 3/2, levels 7-12: 2/1, level 13+: 5/2.
The material component of the spell is a normal footman's flail anointed with
either  a  dose  of  a  potion of superheroism or the blood  of  a  7th-level
fighter,  which  disappears when the spell is cast. For further  information,
see the 2nd-level spiritual hammer, and the 3rd-level spiritual staff.

This  spell  is  similar  to the 2nd-level spiritual  hammer,  the  3rd-level
spiritual staff, and the 4th-level spiritual flail spells. The caster creates
a  shimmering  field  of force, shaped vaguely like a mace.  The  field  does
damage  equal  to  a  footman's mace (2-7 S or M, 1-6 L). Further,  it  gains
magical  to-hit  and damage bonuses in exactly the same manner  as  spiritual
hammer, spiritual staff, and spiritual flail (i.e. +1 per 3 levels).
The  spiritual mace strikes as a fighter of equal level to the priest casting
the  spell, with double weapons specialization in footman's mace.  Thus,  the
mace  is +3 to-hit and +3 to damage due to double specialization, and attacks
per round are as follows: levels 1-6: 3/2, levels 7-12: 2/1, level 13+: 5/2.
The  material component of the spell is a normal footman's mace anointed with
either  a  dose  of  a  potion of superheroism or the blood  of  a  9th-level
fighter,  which  disappears when the spell is cast. For further  information,
see  the  2nd-level  spell  spiritual hammer, the 3rd-level  spell  spiritual

By  casting  this  spell,  the  priest calls into  existence  a  force  field

every  6 levels of the caster, including fractions, with a maximum of +3  (at
twelfth  level or higher). The material component for this spell is a  golden

This spell is a more powerful version of the 2nd-level priest spell spiritual
hammer. The spell creates a shimmering field of force shaped vaguely  like  a
staff. The staff strikes for 1d6 points of damage against all opponents,  and
further  has  a  magical bonus of +1 for every 3 levels of the  priest.  This
bonus  applies for purposes of hitting creatures only hit by magical weapons,
attack  rolls,  and  damage rolls. Unlike spiritual hammer,  spiritual  staff
strikes  as  a  fighter  of equal level to the priest  who  cast  the  spell.
Spiritual staff also gains multiple attacks as a proficient fighter of  equal
level to the priest who cast the spell (i.e., priests level 1-6: 1/1, level 7-
12: 3/2, level 13+: 2/1).
The  material component is a normal staff anointed with either a  dose  of  a
potion  of  heroism,  or the blood of a 5th- or higher level  fighter,  which
disappears  when the spell is cast. For further restrictions,  see  the  2nd-
level priest spell spiritual hammer.

This spell will summon and bind the spirit of a recently dead person to watch
over  and guard the caster or an area specified by the caster at the time  of
the casting, for the duration of the spell. The spirit is obliged to warn the
caster,  but only about any visible and obvious threat that it can  sense  or
about  any intruder on the warded area, as specified by the caster. The  only
person  able  to  communicate with the spirit is  the  caster.  The  material
component is a recently deceased body.

The  casting of this spell causes the victim to be surrounded by a  swarm  of
small, popping, firecracker-like bursts of fire. While these bursts do little
damage  (only  1 point of damage per round) and only 1 points of  damage  per
turn  to  anyone wearing armour other than a shield - they make it impossible
to  concentrate to the degree necessary to cast any spell. This spell will do
no  damage  at  all  to anyone who is thoroughly soaked  in  water,  but  the
concentration  breaking  effects of the spell still  function.  The  material
component of this spell is a pinch of sulphur.

This  power  allows the psionicist to create an  exact  double  of
himself  and  all  equipment.  Hit points  and  PSPs  are  halved,
dropping fractions.  There is no innate communication between  the
doubles.   A  system shock roll must be made when  initiating  the
power.  If it fails, The power fails and the psionicist must  rest
for that round.  Should the double die, the original must make  an
additional  system shock roll or fall unconscious for 1d4  rounds.
Any  magical  items  that  are doubled  function  only  as  normal
versions  for the double.  They are still magical for the original
psionicist.
      The  maintenance  cost of this power is  only  paid  by  the
original.
      Should  the psionicist die, the double disappears  as  well,
taking any remaining hit points or PSP's with it.
      The double may not use this power.  The double is played  by
the player who role plays the original, as the double does have an
understanding of what the original wants.  The double is loyal  to
the  original,  and behaves in a similar fashion as  the  original
would.

Power  Score:  Two doubles are created, each having the same stats
as a single double would.

20:   Fails.  Make a system shock roll or fall unconscious for 2d4
rounds.

When  the  priest casts any cure wounds spell while this spell is active,  he
may  have the spell absorb part of the healing, which he may then release  on
another person or people (this requiring 1 round per person). It is possible,
therefore,  to cure 6 hit points of wounds, spreading it between two  people,
one  damaged by 2 and another by 4. Excess curing may be saved up to the  end
of  the spell's duration. The priest under this spell can sense when a person
is  fully healed and thus when it would be wise to heal the wounds of  others
instead.
Priests  who may cast "cause wounds" spells may reverse this spell to  spread
wounds.  Either  version of the spell works only for cure (or  cause)  wounds
spells personally cast by the priest during the spell's duration.

This  spell  has  a similar effect as squaring the circle from  the  Tome  of
Magic.  It can be used to affect any spells cast during the duration of  this
spell.  These spells (if they have an area of effect) can be shaped,  cut  in
size,  folded, cubed, "sphered", or changed in any possible way, as  long  as
the  total area of effect is not increased from its original size.  Thus,  it
would be possible to change the effect of a fireball into a long cylinder  of
hooked  together  10-foot  cubes (up to a maximum of  33  of  such  cubes).If
desired,  the  area  of effect of (for example) a reverse  gravity  could  be
stretched into a pencil thin but probably hundreds of yards long boundary for
a field so that mice and almost all other rodents could be kept out or killed
(as they would still be catapulted approximately 10 yards per second into the
air  to  fall  to  their deaths once they stepped into this area  of  effect,
whereas  a fast moving human would "fall up" only a few feet before returning
to  mother  earth.  Any spell effect which has an area of effect  other  than
personal or caster or those specifying a certain amount of creatures  can  be
changed as desired as long as it is a single continuous area of effect.

The  material  component is a block of sandstone which has  been  stoneshaped
into  a  most bizarre form which always has to be different from any previous
one  used  by  the caster. Each form must somehow have to do  with  infinity.
Afterwards  it  has  to be changed by a polymorph any  object  spell  into  a
diamond in that specific form. As this normally does not last longer  than  a
few  hours,  it cannot be used very often (or the caster must have  unlimited
access to polymorph any object spells).

By  means  of this spell, the wizard creates a powerful magical weapon  which
only  he  can wield. Wizards of good alignment can create a staff  of  light;
those  of evil alignment can use the reverse of this spell to create a  staff
of  darkness; those of neutral alignment (with respect to good and evil)  can
create  either form of the spell, but with reduced effectiveness. The  verbal
component of this spell consists of but a single word, which creates  in  the
wizard's hand a sphere of light (or darkness), a few inches in diameter;  the
remainder  of  the casting time is then spent carefully pulling  and  shaping
this sphere into a full-sized staff. Spell duration is considered to begin on
the following round, so that the wizard can make at least as many attacks  as
he has levels.
The  glowing  staff of light will brightly illuminate a 30-foot  radius,  and
when  cast  by  a good aligned wizard this illumination will  be  painful  to
supernatural evil creatures such as undead, demons, devils, etc. (these  take
2  HP of damage per round, saving versus spell each round for half damage). A
darkness  cast in the area of the staff of light will eliminate this  painful
effect for the duration of the darkness, but does not actually make the  area
dark, rather the illumination is reduced to the level of dim torchlight.
Whether  cast  by a good or neutral wizard, the staff of light strikes  as  a
weapon, +2 (for purposes of what can be hit by it; there is no actual  to-hit
bonus) and does a base damage of 1d6 points. This damage can be increased  by
1d6  for  each  round  of spell duration that remains;  every  such  increase
shortens  the  duration of the spell by one round. Intent to increase  damage
must  be  stated before the to-Hit Die is rolled, but spell duration  is  not
affected  if the attack is a miss. If the staff of light is used to strike  a
creature with a strong negative material existence (wights, spectres, xeg-yi,
etc.)  there  is  a  50%  chance that the remaining spell  duration  will  be
expended as damage whether or not the wizard wishes it.
The  staff of darkness sheds deep shadows in a 30-foot radius, through  which
only the wizard can see clearly; shades (the monster) and other wizards using
staff  of darkness are at -1 to-hit when within these shadows, and all others
(even  those with infravision) are at -3 to-hit and +3 to their Armour  Class
when in these shadows (note that two wizards within 30 feet of each other and
each  holding as staff of darkness will both be at -1 to-hit, but the effects
of multiple staves are not otherwise cumulative).
In  addition, when cast by an evil aligned wizard, this sphere of shadow will
affect supernatural creatures of good alignment (shedu, lammasu, devas, etc.)
as if they were affected by a stinking cloud (saving throw versus death magic
reduces  the effect to mild nausea, -1 to-hit and to damage; this penalty  is
cumulative with the -3 to-hit penalty for poor visibility). A light  cast  in
the  area  of  the staff of darkness will remove this nauseating  effect  and
reduce the to-hit penalty to -1 and the Armour Class penalty to +1, but  will
not significantly brighten the area.
The  staff  of darkness strikes as a +2 weapon (for purposes of what  can  be
hit),  doing  1d6  points of damage. For each round of  spell  duration  that
remains,  the  wizard can choose to inflict numbing cold on his victim;  this
cold  has  a  5% chance per round of spell duration expended, cumulative,  of
causing loss of use of a limb for 1d6 rounds, and otherwise causes the victim
to  lose  one  point  each of Strength and Dexterity per  round  of  duration
expended,  also  for 1d6 rounds; thereafter the lost Strength  and  Dexterity
return  at  the rate of one point each per round, or the limb becomes  usable
immediately.  Cold-resistant  and cold-using creatures  get  a  saving  throw
against this effect, and its duration is halved for them in any case.
If  the  areas  of radiance and shadow of a staff of light  and  a  staff  of
darkness  intersect,  the  effects of both are  negated  in  the  overlapping
region.  If the staves are within 30 feet of one another, both cease to  shed
their  light or darkness, but their powers are otherwise unaffected.  Neither
staff  has  any  physical substance, and thus cannot  be  parried  except  by
another  staff  of  the opposite type or by a rod of force;  wall  of  force,
forcecage,  or  similar force barrier will stop a staff.  If  two  staves  of
opposite  type  touch one another for any reason, both are  destroyed  in  an
explosion  of  40-foot radius causing 1d6 points damage  for  each  round  of
duration  remaining  in the two spells, cumulative. The wizards  holding  the
staves  automatically take full damage, all others within 40 feet save versus
spell to take half damage.

The  material component of this spell is a pearl (a black pearl for the  dark
version)  of  no less than 500 gp value, which is held in one hand  when  the
command  word  is  uttered. The pearl is transformed into a small  sphere  of
light  or  darkness; the somatic component is the stretching and moulding  of
this  sphere  into a staff. There is rumoured to be a variant of  this  spell
that  allows the sphere formed from the pearl to be hurled as a missile,  but
the specific details have been lost.

This spell creates a magical staff. First, a thaumaturge must find the finest
wood  of  a  hazel tree and fashion it magically into a wizard's  staff.  The
staff  must  be  then  dipped in serpent's venom and touched  by  a  dragon's
breath. Then, it must be enchanted and sprinkled with mithril dust. The staff
thus created will be capable of striking at +3 to-hit for 1d6+3 HP twice  per
round.  Once per day it may strike as a venomous weapon, doing double  damage
for  the  attack and causing the victim to save versus poison or  suffer  the
effects.  The  staff may also attack for 10d6 with the breath of  the  dragon
which imbued this magic, however, this attack destroys the staff.

This spell inflicts the victim with the sexual disease or sexual insanity  of
the caster's choice, until cured by a cure disease performed by a priest of a
good  aligned  god  and  of higher level than the wizard  who  inflicted  the
disease.  While the victim suffers from the disease, the spell  prevents  him
from  being  killed by it, or in fact by anything, be it  a  sword,  a  fire,
another  disease, or a blow to the head. Should the victim drop below  0  hit
points, he will become immobile but remain conscious.
He will be incapable of performing any actions until he is healed above 0 hit
points.  Dropping below -10 hit points will not kill him. He regains  no  hit
points from resting if he is below 0, his body is too battered to heal itself
and  only magical or herbal healing will help him. The material component  of
this spell is a corpse that has rotted for at least a week.

This spell is only effective in full sunlight or its equivalent (10 continual
light  spells  with  orange-yellow light within 10 feet of  each  other,  one
daylight  spell, or one sunsword being swung). This spell causes  a  brightly
intensive  ray of sunlight to strike down in the area of effect. This  causes
damage  of  6d6 fire damage. This damage is so intense, that not  even  magic
resistance or natural fire resistance helps against it - even if the spell is
used against a fire giant, a fire elemental, or a red dragon. This damage may
be halved by a saving throw versus spell. For undead, this is the same effect
as  full  sunlight (especially effective against vampires, which take  double
normal  damage  with no saving throw in addition to the damage they  normally
take  in  sunlight).  This  damage is applicable  once  every  round  at  the
beginning of each round. This sunlight is so bright that anyone looking  into
it  is  permanently blinded unless they save versus death magic.  If  anybody
intends to stay inside longer, they have to save once per round if they  have
their  eyes closed and at least three times per round with open eyes or  more
if  they  have more than three actions per round. Undead do not get a  saving
throw in this light against the blinding effect, unless they are of the  rare
sort of undead that thrive and subside on sunlight.

The material component is a glass jar containing one stone of continual light
per round of duration. These are in addition of the ones described above.

This  spell  creates  a gate between the wizard's current  location  and  any
location which the wizard has been before. The gate can be freely crossed  in
either direction and will last one hour per level of wizard. Range is not  an
issue  (hence the name of the spell). Anyone can cross the stargate, as  long
as  it  is in existence. To cast this spell, the wizard must have some chalk,
blessed by a priest, with which he must draw a star-shaped portal on a  wall.
The chalk is consumed in the casting.

This  power requires at least two psionicists in convergence whose
total  levels  must  be  50  or  higher.   No  psionicist  in  the
convergence  can be below level 13.  All psionicists must  make  a
successful  power  check in the same round  the  power  is  to  be
initiated.   It  is not required that more than one psionicist  in
the  convergence know this power since being convergence makes  it
available to the other psionicists.
      The effect of this power is to totally immobilize the victim
to  the  point  that  they are utterly helpless.   Their  body  is
rendered  immobile in that they can make no physical motion,  they
are  effectively rooted to the spot they are standing in, so  that
they  cannot  be  physically moved, and they are anchored  to  the
time/space continuum so that they cannot teleport, and things like
teleport  trigger,  and contingency spells that  are  supposed  to
teleport  the  victim  will fail.  Further,  the  victim's  mental
processes  are slowed down to 1/60 of their normal rate, rendering
them virtually helpless against telepathic attacks.

Prerequisite:  13th level, convergence, rigidity (or  immovability
for those lacking Dragon Kings), time/space anchor, stasis field

Power  Score:   The  victim is held in stasis  until  released  by
another power check.

20:   The power backfires, and the psionicists fall victim to  the
power  until  they run out of PSPs to maintain it.  This  backfire
occurs if any psionicists roll a 20.

      This  spell causes the victim to have a serious static charge  for  the
duration of the spell. The static charge causes the affected creature  to  be
very edgy and irritable. The saving throw is at +1 per level (or Hit Die)  of
the victim - but at -1 per level of the wizard. The material components are a
glass rod and wool.

This  spell  causes  an amount of damage equal to ten percent  of  a  subject
creature's  current hit points (rounded down), to creatures of a level  lower
than the priest's level on a failed saving throw versus death magic when  the
creature  failed to either address the priest or refer to the  priest  as  he
requests. The material component for this spell is a miniature paper crown.

This spell lets a wizard steal the class-related skills of a willing humanoid
victim and transfer them either to the wizard or to a special container.  The
victim drops to first level, and regains levels at a rate of 1 per four hours
thereafter. The wizard gains half the class-related skills of the victim  (if
stealing from a fighter, the wizard will gain the ability to wear armour  and
attack with a THAC0 halfway between the fighter's and the default 20 with any
weapon  with  which the fighter is proficient; if stealing from a  thief  the
wizard  will  gain  thief  abilities which are the  average  of  the  thief's
abilities  and  the base of 4; in no case will abilities go down  because  of
this). Abilities which are granted by a deity cannot be transferred this way,
nor can spellcasting abilities. The transferred abilities fade after one turn
per level.

The  material component is a symbol of the class to be transferred, specially
prepared  and  costing not less than 10 gp per level of the  target.  If  the
wizard  wishes, he may imbue the symbol with these skills rather  than  using
them  at  the time (in which case it will not disappear). The primary purpose
of this use is to provide the material component for Spirit Skill.

This  spell is the same as a magic missile spell, except that it can be  cast
in  absolute silence, and its missiles are extremely hard to see  (5%  chance
per  observer's level). It is perfect for those who need quiet,  mage/thieves
for example.

      This  cantrip  creates 4 spheres of force of approximately  1  foot  in
diameter. They can be placed anywhere within 20 feet of each other, and  last
approximately  1 round per 4 levels of the wizard. Combat of just  about  any
sort  will destroy these very useful discs, so they are not useful in combat.
Furthermore,  these disks cannot inflict any damage to anything,  since  they
are made by a cantrip.

This  spell requires a dagger, +1 as a component. The spell causes the dagger
in question to disappear and attack the victim for the duration of the spell.
The  dagger  attacks  as a fighter of a level equal to that  of  the  wizard,
including  attacks per turn and so on. The dagger does not  get  its  magical
bonus  to attack, unless a dagger better than +1 is used (+2 = +1 to  attack,
+3  = +2 to attack, etc.). Sting however does negate the use of a shield,  if
the victim has one.
A  dimension  door, astral spell, blink or other location blinking  spell  or
spell-like  effect  will successfully avoid the sting. The  wizard  need  not
concentrate on the spell for the dagger to attack. The dagger is consumed  by
the spell.

level,  across  any gap the wizard desires. It is sturdy  and  safe  to  walk
across, and can bear the weight of an elephant.

The  material  component of this spell is a piece of rope,  which  should  be

This  spell  grants  the  wizard a gaze attack equal  to  that  possessed  by
medusae.  Anyone within 5 yards per level that meets the caster's  gaze  must
save  versus  petrification  or  be turned  to  stone.  Like  a  medusa,  the
spellcaster is vulnerable to his own gaze. Unlike the medusa, the Stone  Gaze
is  an  active  attack: the caster must consciously attack one creature,  and
only  one  attack can be performed per round. The only exception to  this  is
when the caster accidentally meets his own gaze.
The  component for this spell is the eye of a creature that possesses a stone
to flesh gaze, such as a medusa or basilisk.

Unless the victims save versus spell, they will find that all of their limbs,
and  indeed their entire bodies, have grown heavy and stiff. All to-hit rolls

The  priest casts this spell directly into the prism on his holy symbol (this
spell  was created for a deity whose symbol is a hand grasping a prism).  The
priest  then names (not by truename) the person he wants to talk to. If  this
target  person  is within 10 yards of a holy symbol to the same  deity  (thus
that  holy symbol also has a prism in it), then the target person will notice
that  the  prism flashes. Only the target person will notice the  flashes  of
light.  When the target person touches the holy symbol, the prism  will  show
the  face  of  the priest, and the priest's prism will show the face  of  the
target  person.  The priest can then talk into his prism  and  hold  a  short
conversation with the target person.
If  the target person is not within 10 yards of a specified holy symbol,  the
priest will feel like the spell was a dud. The spell will wait one minute for
the  person answer. If the person did not answer, the priest will  know  that
the person did not answer.
Idle  chatter is not being appreciated by the deity (noise pollution  on  his
holy  waves). Quick conversations are appreciated. There is also a 5%  chance
that  someone or something associated with the deity (one of his  priests  or
minions)  will notice and remember the conversation. This does not  mean  the
priest or minion will do anything, just that others may be listening in.
The  material components for this spell are the two needed holy symbols,  and
are obviously not consumed in the casting.

This  spell  will protect any magical or non-magical stone  in  the  area  of
effect  from  the  following spells: transmute rock to mud,  passwall,  phase
door, disintegrate, stone to flesh, animate object, earthquake, polymorph any
object, stone shape, distance distortion, and animate rock. It further  gives
the  stone  affected  a  +3  on  saving throws  against  other  attack  forms
(fireball, lightning bolt, cold, acid, blows, etc.).
An  earth  elemental can neither be conjured in the area nor enter  it.  This
spell will have no effect on stone golems or clay golems, but it will prevent
xorn,  umber hulks, purple worms and similar creatures from burrowing in  the
affected area. At the DM's option, non-standard spells, spell-like effects (a
horn of blasting, for example), and psionic abilities which affect stone  may
be  prevented from operating. This spell can be made permanent by  permanency
with the loss of one point of Constitution from the caster due to the use  of
the permanency. The material component of this spell is a boulder of at least
400 gp weight.
This  spell was researched by Whitewolf. Like freeze [2] (q.v.),  this  is  a
pretty silly spell just for castle defense.

When stone seeds is cast, it causes plant seeds to become magically enchanted
so  as  to  enable  them to grow in to solid stone. The seeds  will  grow  at
quadruple normal rate for 4 weeks. During this time the roots will grow  down
into the stone a distance of 1 inch per level of the priest in hard stone  or
2  inches  per level in soft stone. After this month (28 days) is  over,  the
plants  will grow normally. Thus they will require food, light, and  sunlight
if they are to continue growing after this point.
The effect of the plants growing into a stone structure are rather nasty, for
it could remove around 10 90% of the structure's structural points, depending
upon the thickness of the stone.
To  cast  this  spell, the priest must mix a handful of seeds  from  whatever
hardy  plants are available (such as crabgrass, ivy, cactus, dandelion, etc.)
with the seeds to be planted. This must be then mixed in a leather pouch with
sapphire  dust  of  not less than 50 gp value per 5 inch square  area  to  be
covered.  The  priest then "sows" the seeds as he casts the spell,  with  the
seeds magically implanting themselves in the stone.
The spell takes 1 turn per 5 inch square area to be covered to cast.

This  spell can be used to crush large pieces of rock into smaller parts that
can then be removed easily. It is used to shatter rocks in order to make room
for  a new road or passage or simply to get more manageable pieces out  of  a
large, immobile rock.
The  spell affects ten cubic feet of rock per round. Magical constructs, such
as  a wizard's wall of stone, receive a saving throw versus crushing blow  to
negate  the  effects.  The  material component  is  a  shovel  or  any  other
excavating  instrument. This spell was designed for  the  Dark  Sun  campaign
world.

Using  this spell, the caster can create a wall made of stone. The wall  must
stand on a solid surface and can meld into adjacent stone objects.
The  spell creates a wall of stone that is half an inch thick, ten feet  wide
and two feet high per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can make
a  stone  wall 5 inches thick, 50 feet wide and 20 feet high. One turn  after
the  casting  the  magic of the spell fades and the wall of stone  becomes  a
permanent  object (that is not subject to dispel magic); this is  the  reason
the spell belongs to the Alteration and not to the Invocation school.
The  stone wall is primarily a defensive spell, used to stop pursuers or seal
an  underground  passage. Another use of the spell is to make  constructs  of
stone.  The material component of the spell is rock of any type of a  roughly
equal amount: the spell does not create new material but rather reshapes  the
material  already present. This spell was designed for the Dark Sun  campaign
world.

      This  cantrip conjures up a small pebble in any desired location within
20  feet of the wizard. The verbal component is a short phrase describing the
desired location ("in John's shoe", for example). If the pebble is to  affect
another  creature  in any way, as in the above example,  a  saving  throw  is
permitted to resist the spell.

When  a priest casts stonewood and subsequently touches a wooden object,  the
wood in that object is magically enhanced and given a stonelike strength. The
altered  wood  is  in every way the same as untreated wood (texture,  colour,
weight, flexibility, etc.) except for the stonelike strength and hardness. An
object  of up to 100 square feet and a thickness of no more than 1  inch  per
level  of  the  priest of wood can be affected by this spell.  To  cast  this
spell, the priest needs mistletoe and a gemstone of at least 500 gp.

This  spell immediately stops the bleeding of a wounded individual.  It  will
not  heal  any damage, only stop the flow and scent of blood. This is  useful
when  a  priest needs to halt bleeding of an individual who cannot  be  fully
healed at that time (note that even a bandaged wound may still attract sharks
and  other  creatures by scent). The spell will cease to attract  sharks  and
other  carnivorous fish, but the amount of blood already spilled  will  still
exist. This spell can also be used on land to stop the victim from leaving  a
trail  of blood. It may also be used to halt the adverse effects of a  weapon
of wounding.
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

When  the priest casts this spell, the sun immediately seems to stop  in  the
sky, over any populated area which the priest can see the major part of.  The
area actually experiences extra turns of daytime; as far as those outside the
area  are  concerned, the whole period of extra time happened in one instant.
The material component for this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This  spell  is intended for those times an army is racing toward  you  in  a
charge. Each creature in the cone will have to save versus spell or come to a
sudden  full  stop as if it ran into a solid wall (no damage is caused,  they
just stop). For the rest of the duration, those that did not save cannot move
towards  the priest. Those that did make their saving throw can move  towards
the priest only at half rate.
To  cast  this spell, the priest puts his open hand forward and yells "Stop!"
(like a traffic cop).

This  spell is similar to enchant an item or contingency, in that it prepares
a  black  opal of no less value than 2000 gp for the storage of  a  passwall.
This  spell will stay on the opal until the passwall is cast on it. Then,  it
will  store the passwall for 1 day per level of caster. This spell must first
be  cast on the opal and then the passwall can be cast on it. The clock  then
starts  clicking  on how long the spell lasts. This is because  the  passwall
starts  eating the opal. After the elapsed time, the opal is totally consumed
by  the passwall, and both are wasted. If, before the time of expiration, the
opal is touched to a surface and a command word is spoken (determined at time
of  casting store passwall), it activates the passwall in the direction  that
the  opal  is touching the surface. A caster may only have one store passwall
for  every  six levels of the caster (a 12th-level caster can have  two  such
stones  prepared at one time). Also, since the time activation is not started
until  the  Passwall  is actuall cast on the opal, a wizard  could  have  two
stones  prepared with him and only when he thinks he might need  one  in  the
near  future cast passwall on it. Then, within the duration, the  caster  can
use it. He can also give it to another person, but must tell them the command
word.

This  spell  is  an  improved  version of Tenser's  floating  disk.  The  big
improvement is the speed of the disk - now 30. The disk can also move from  3
feet  to 30 feet off the ground or water. The disk movement is based relative
to the wizard, which prevents the wizard from riding their own disk. However,
if  two  wizards  use this spell, they can ride each others to  travel.  This
travel  can  either  be  in  the  form of  independent  movement  (tricky  to
communicate  since somebody else is steering yours) or master-slave.  In  the
master-slave travel, one wizard steers a disk while he rides on a disk  which
stays the same distance from its wizard.

S1      S2      M

Caster 1 is the master and riding in the back (caster 3's disk). Caster 2  is
in  the  front riding on the master's disk - his own disk stays x feet behind
him.  Caster 3 rides in the middle and his disk also stays x feet behind him.
Caster  1  steers the chain while the other two can sleep, eat, cast  spells,
etc. All other parameters are the same as Tenser's floating disk.

At  the end of this powerful prayer, the priest's body convulses as if struck
by  lightning,  and  glows  with  divine radiance.  Thereafter  the  priest's
Strength ability score is raised by 1d4 HP plus 1 HP for every two levels  of
the  priest  (fractions rounded down) to a maximum of  the  Strength  of  the
deity, and is given full attack and damage bonuses commensurate with the  new
Strength. The priest retains the augmented Strength for 1 round per level.
Use  of  this  spell  draws the attention of the deity, and  the  spell  only
succeeds if the deity is pleased with the usage (i.e., the priest is  seeking
to  avenge some wrong done to him or his companions, the priest is  a  battle
against  dire odds, the priest is fighting an enemy of the opposite alignment
of  his deity, etc.). If the deity is especially pleased with the priest  (5%
chance),  the  Strength bonus may be extended for the entire  length  of  the
quest the priest is on.
When  the  spell ends, the supernatural energy abruptly leaves  the  priest's
body, again causing convulsions in the priest which stun him for 1 round. The
priest  must then make a Constitution check, or fall comatose for 1d3  turns,
during which time he can do nothing but rest.
The  material component of this spell is a vial of holy water which  must  be
swallowed during the casting, and the priest's holy symbol.

This is a variant of the 2nd-level strength spell. Unless otherwise noted  it
mimics  the  effects of strength. This spell can only be cast  on  a  willing
recipient.
This  spell utilizes a creature's own life force, temporarily binding it with
negative  material plane energies, channelling the resulting energy  flow  to
produce unholy strength in the spell recipient. Strength gained is based upon
class as follows:

     Class     Strength Gain
     Warrior   1d10 points
     Wizard    1d6 points
     Priest    1d8 points
     Rogue     1d8 points

All  character  classes,  not just warriors, have the  chance  to  jump  into
exceptional  Strength ratings as if they were warriors  providing  that  this
spell  gives the recipient greater than 18 Strength. Warriors, on  the  other
hand,  are allowed to advance as high as 19 Strength through the use of  this
spell.
The  recipient of the spell will undergo a minor change in appearance as well
while  the spell's duration is in effect. Bright, white, pinpoints  of  light
will  glow  in  the centres of the subject's eyes as a result  of  the  large
quantity  of  negative  plane energy that is being utilized  to  augment  the
character's Strength.
At  the end of the spell's duration, the recipient will experience a terrible
backlash from the exertion upon his life energies and the terrible experience
of  such  close contact with negative material plane energies. As the spell's
duration  ends,  the recipient must make a saving throw versus  death  magic.
Success means that he takes only 2d8 points of damage. Failure indicates that
the  life force of the character was damaged greatly and the character  takes
2d8  points of damage and also loses one life energy level (experience level,
Hit Dice, etc.).
Creatures without Strength ratings receive a bonus of +2 to attack and damage
rolls on all attacks.

The  material component for this spell is a bit of bone from a giant skeleton
or a pinch of vampire dust.

This  spell  allows a bone construct to be strengthened and made denser.  The
strength of the bone is doubled by the casting of this spell. The spell takes
one  round to cast, and 2 rounds of chanting while the material component  is
absorbed  into the target of the spell. The material component is a piece  of
bone  that  is a near perfect match to the object of the spell. The component
is  then placed against the object and absorbed into it. The new object  will
be  twice as dense and twice as strong, with regards to weapons, they receive
no  penalties to-hit and damage, and they will not break on a maximum  damage
strike.  There  is a 2% chance per level of the caster that the  strengthened
bone will act as steel.

This spell strengthens any and all elementals and paraelementals conjured  by
the  caster; it affects lesser, standard, and greater elementals. This  spell
may be cast in one of two ways; its reverse may be cast in only one way. Only
one  type  of  elemental  (earth, for example) or  paraelemental  (silt,  for
example) may be affected per casting of this spell.
If cast immediately before conjuring elementals, all 1s rolled in calculating
their hit points are rerolled until another number results. For example,  the
priest  casts  strengthen  elemental  and  follows  it  with  conjure  lesser
elemental.  After determining that two 4 HD elementals will  appear,  the  DM
rolls  6, 5, 2, and 2; then 7, 4, 1, and 3. He rolls again and obtains  a  5.
The   resulting  elementals  have  15  and  19  HP  (6+5+2+2  and   7+4+5+3),
respectively. In addition the elementals attack with a +1 to-hit  and  damage
until  their  service  is fulfilled (they are destroyed,  dismissed,  or  the
conjure  spell expires). The priest must begin the conjuring spell the  round
immediately  after  casting  this  spell. Should  he  fail  to  initiate  the
conjuring  during  the  following round, or should he fail  to  complete  the
conjuring (because he takes damage, for example) this spell is wasted.
The  second method of casting is to cast this spell on elementals  that  have
already  been  conjured.  If cast in this manner, strengthen  elemental  only
confers  a +1 to-hit and damage on the target elemental. For this version  of
the  spell, the caster may choose up to 1 elemental per 3 experience  levels;
all elementals must be of the same type and be within 20 yards of each other.
This  version of the spell lasts for 1 turn + 1 round per level  and  has  no
effect on elementals currently under the effects of the first version of this
spell.
The  reverse,  weaken  elemental, imposes a  1 to-hit and  damage  on  target
elementals.  As  above,  the  caster may choose  up  to  1  elemental  per  3
experience levels; all elementals must be of the same type and be  within  20
yards of each other. This version of the spell lasts for 1 turn + 1 round per
level.  Elementals  are  permitted a saving throw to  avoid  these  weakening
effects.
The  material  component  for this spell is a small bit  of  the  elemental's
element (for example, the caster's breath when strengthening air elementals).
The  material component for the reverse is a small bit of the element opposed
to  the target elemental's native plane (water for a fire elemental, rain for
a magma paraelemental, etc.).

This  spell strengthens illusions to the point that even undead or successful
disbelievers  still  believe in them. The spell gives  one  spell  level  per
caster  level.  With  these  spell levels, illusions  of  any  level  may  be
strengthened. Undead or successful disbelievers have to save versus spell (in
addition to the normal saving throws, if applicable) at a -1 per caster level
and  +1 for each of their own levels or Hit Dice. If successful, the illusion
vanishes  like  any normal illusion; if it fails, the illusion  affects  them
normally. The saving throw may be modified further by the caster if he  gives
up  additional  spell levels. Every time an additional amount to  the  normal
amount of spell levels is used, the saving throw is adjusted by -2. Thus,  it
may  be even more likely that the illusion affects the targets normally.  The
casting  times for these illusion spells are increased by one unit per  spell
level given up for them (an improved phantasmal force with a casting time  of
2  is strengthened by this spell with 6 spell levels; while this reduces  the
saving throw versus spell by -4, the casting time increases to 8).
This  spell  may be cast multiple times on one person by the same caster.  It
has to be the same caster who uses the same spell on the same person multiple
times.  This is called stacking or layering. The stacking or layering  effect
will  be  used  quite often in many of the following spells.  The  effect  of
stacking  or  layering will be given in a form something like the  following:
"the  spell  strengthen illusions may be layered for a maximum  effect  of  3
spell levels per caster level". This means that the target creature can store
a maximum of one spell level of effect in its person at once.

The  material component is a mithril coin of at least 10 gp worth  for  every
spell level gained.

This  enables the wizard to carve a special rune on some structure,  a  wall,
well,  or  other  stone design, that will keep it sturdy and strong  for  the
duration  specified. About 250 cubic feet of stone per level can be affected.
Earthquakes will not damage the structure.
After  tenth  level,  the  spell  becomes permanent  (until  dispelled).  The
material components for this spell are a piece of chalk, and a set of  arches
constructed  of  steel. The wizard must analyze the structure beforehand,  to
place the spell appropriately.

When  striking is cast, it causes the caster's weapon to become enchanted  to
do  double normal weapon damage when it strikes. For example, a dagger  would
do  2d4/2d3  instead of 1d4/1d3, while a two-handed sword would do  2d10/6d6.
Any plusses to the caster's to-hit and damage rolls are not doubled, only the
basic weapon damage is. Bonuses, if any, are added afterwards.
If this spell is cast upon a weapon created by a conjured weapon spell, there
will  be  an  additional +1 bonus to all to-hit and damage rolls. The  weapon
then  counts as a + (caster's level/4) weapon for purposes of special defense
(round fractions down).
The  material  component for this spell is the caster's  holy  symbol,  which
passes  the enchantment to the weapon, while the caster invokes the  blessing
of the warrior god.

The  use  of this spell calls down upon a specially consecrated weapon  of  a
believer the benediction of his deity. This spell only works for those of the
same  faith  as  the  priest and the weapons used must have  been  previously
dedicated to that deity through a ceremony spell. Once these conditions  have
been  met,  the  spell endows the weapon with a glowing,  magical  aura  that
inflicts  an additional 1d6 points of damage per blow struck. This additional
damage will affect creatures that are struck only by magic weapons of  +2  or
less  (while  the  weapon itself may do no damage to these creatures).  Note:
this  spell  will  not  affect weapons which are +2 or better.  The  material
component is the priest's holy symbol.

This spell is used to stuff spells into high quality items or any individual.
The components are the same as those required to cast the stuffed spell, plus
some  added  verbal  components. Casting time is 5  rounds  plus  the  normal
spellcasting  time.  About  the duration: this  spell  is  either  impact  or
mentally activated, to be chosen upon casting. The spell will wear off  after
one month per level of the caster.
Some possible uses of this spell are: stuff a fireball in your arrow. Stuff a
stoneskin  in  yourself, with impact activation. If you  are  a  cleric/mage,
stuff a heal in your moderately hurt pal (this gets the best use out of  your
fighters: they can travel around with few hit points, confident in  the  fact
that the next blow they receive will bring them back to their maximum). Stuff
a  mentally  activated featherfall on anyone. Stuff a meteor  swarm  in  your
shield (be sure to have magic resistance though).

This spell causes the wizard to be surrounded by an aura of magical fire.  It
will  cause non-living objects not in the initial area when spell is launched
to  burn (i.e.: the wizard doesn't end up naked). It does 2d4 points of  fire
damage  to  anyone within 10 yards of the caster during the duration  of  the
spell.  It  can  be  cancelled by very heavy rain or  immersion.  During  the
duration,  it  adds  the  effects of fire resistance  upon  the  caster,  but
increases cold damage by +1 per dice.
Obviously,  Styrman developed iceform as well (use your preferred components,
sulphur and glass or mashed firenewt brains and snowman's broom respectively,
or whatever).

This devious spell causes a targeted creatures to believe that they have just
discovered  and  successful  disbelieved  an  illusion.  This  is  a  bit  of
misdirection caused by the wizard, as the item selected by the wizard  to  be
believed as an illusion could actually be real.
This  spell could be great for causing enemies of the wizard to walk  into  a
pit because it "does not really exist".
If  the  victim has a reason to believe that a so called illusion is actually
not  an  illusion,  then  he  get a saving throw  versus  spell  to  actually
determine if the item is an illusion or not.

The  material component of this spell is a bit of burning incense,  which  of
course  adds to a magical "atmosphere", thus making the victims believe  even
harder that they are really seeing an illusion.

As in Harlan Ellison's short story How's the Night Life on Cissalda?.
The  casting of this spell will cause an interdimensional connection  between
the  world of the spell caster and the alternate world of the Cissaldans. The
utterance  of this spell attracts one Cissaldan which will come  through  the
connection and attack whomever the spellcaster directs the spell against.
The  recipient  has  an  immediate desire to "do a disgusting  thing  with  a
disgusting  thing"  and will fall upon the Cissaldan with  much  vigour.  The
recipient  will  not  be able to do or say anything else  since  his  or  her
complete concentration is centred on the Cissaldan. The two will continue  to
copulate  until the recipient dies of starvation. There is no  known  way  of
separating someone (or something since the Cissaldans do not discriminate  in
any  way) from a Cissaldan until the recipient dies. After the death  of  the
spell recipient, the Cissaldan will return to the world from which it came.
Cissaldans  are  described  as  having two  penises,  two  vaginas,  and  are
physically  disgusting to look at. They, however, love to  make  love  so  to
speak, and can physically adapt to any sexual physiology.

The air priest uses this spell to summon a flying creature to serve him as  a
mount. The creature must be intelligent (but not above average) and should be
in the area when the casting takes place (the DM decides on the chance).
The  creature will then be bound to serve the priest as best as  it  can.  It
will  carry  other persons, if it is able to do so (a roc, for  example,  can
carry  many). The caster has a limited telepathic link with the creature  and
can  order it with simple mental commands. He must, however, ride it all  the
time; the creature will not move away from him. The spell does not in any way
enhance the abilities of the mount or its intelligence.
At the end of the duration of the spell, the creature will land for the rider
to  dismount.  If  there is no place to land, the creature will  fly  to  the
nearest  land  and leave its rider there. If the priest refuses to  dismount,
the creature will attack him.
Casting  this spell with the intention of killing the animal is an evil  act.
The  material component of the spell is a gold piece and herbs that  must  be
burned  at the time of the casting. This spell was designed for the Dark  Sun
campaign  world.  Any  monetary units are for the Dark  Sun,  increase  where
appropriate.

This spell actually creates a greater balrog from the magics of the plane  of
Concordant Opposition.

The  balrog is the ultimate chaotic killing machine. It is derived  from  the
existing  souls of the plane of Concordant Opposition; fuelling its  constant
battle rage from the entities of deceased fighters.
A greater balrog is around eight feet tall, humanoid in shape, while having a
very  broad  chest. It has a wingspread of twenty feet that will function  to
lift  the  creature only when it is in an environment that  allows  magic  to
function. When it is an area that does not promote magic, the wings  are  not
large  enough to lift the creature, since it is so very dense; weighing  over
five  tons.  With grey-black skin, and huge claws and fangs it is  definitely
lethal to mortal.
The  creature is immune to any mind influencing attack (charms, hold  spells,
sleep,  etc)  since it technically has no mind; only a basic drive  to  kill,
similar  to  undead. It has a 95% magic resistance against  any  spell  below
tenth,  and  no magic resistance against any spell of legend.  If  the  magic
resistance fails, the creature takes half damage from heat attacks, and  half
damage from cold attacks. It does take full damage from acid and lightning.
The  creature  has  three eyes, all of which allow it to see  as  humans  do.
However, its left eye gives it infravision to 90 feet, and its right gives it
ultravision  to 60 feet. The middle eye gives the balrog the ability  to  see
things  in  the  ethereal, or border ethereal. Furthermore,  the  middle  eye
allows it to see things out of phase, and things that are invisible. Needless
to say, it has an excellent perception, only being surprised on a 1 in 10.
The  creature has a natural 19 Strength, giving it bonuses to damage for  its
claw  attacks.  If there is space available, and it is fighting  on  soil  or
sand,  it  will  attempt to buffet its wings. This causes no  damage  to  its
opponents,  but will fan the loose soil or sand into the air.  All  opponents
within 15 feet of the creature must make a Dexterity check every round or  be
blinded  for 1d4 rounds. The balrog has transparent eye lids that prevent  it
from being affected by the churned dust.
The balrog will attack anything that is in its vicinity that is larger than a
squirrel. If it has been engaged in melee by more than one opponent, it  will
attack  the  largest  threat  first. However, it cannot  distinguish  precise
inches in height.Therefore if three humans attacked it, the recipient of  the
creature's attacks would be randomly determined.
When the spell is cast the wizard draws a pentagram and stands within it.  If
the  spell  is  successful and the balrog appears, the wizard  will  have  no
control  over the creature; it will attack anything and everything.  However,
the  wizard,  and  anyone  standing  within  the  drawn  pentagram,  will  be
undetectable  by  the  creature and therefore are safe. Once  any  individual
leaves  the  pentagram, that person then becomes visible to  the  menace.  So
usually its a good policy to wait until the creature has left the area before
breaking out the Old Mill.

The  material components for the spell are a sanctified holy symbol from  the
major  Chaotic Neutral god, and any "cursed berserker" weapon. Both of  which
are lost when the spell is cast.

By  means  of  this  spell  a druid can improve his  Strength,  Constitution,
Dexterity or Charisma to 22.
The  druid  must have a great need to cast the spell, always related  to  his
role  as protector of the natural environment. He must meditate for one  hour
and communicate with his patron land spirit, explaining in detail the reasons
he wants the extraordinary ability. Defeat of a powerful defiler (tenth level
or more experienced) is an adequate reason.
At the end of the hour the druid gains the augmented ability if the spirit of
the  land  agrees on the importance of the task. The spirit of the  land  may
grant  additional  points if the situation is serious  enough,  at  the  DM's
discretion (the spirit, being a sort of deity, can grant any number of points
in any ability or abilities but this is very rare).
The effects of this spell cannot be dispelled. Further, the augmented ability
cannot be modified, either positive or negative, by any normal means such  as
draining  attacks,  use of magical items, etc., since it  is  the  result  of
divine intervention. This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This  spell  is very different than the existing wizard spell summon  shadow.
The  spell  summons  one  shadow for every four  levels  of  the  priest.  In
addition, in lieu of summoning 3 shadows, a 12th-level priest can summon  one
ether  shadow (see below). The shadows are under the control of  the  caster,
though  an  ether  shadow gains a saving throw versus  death  magic  and,  if
successful,  overcomes  the  priest's control and  becomes  free-willed.  The
material  component of this spell is a black opal of 100 or more gold  pieces
value.

Ether shadows, also known as greater shadows, are the progenitors of the more
common  shadows  of monster fame. Like shadows, their chilling  touch  drains
Strength  at the increased rate of two points per hit. Lost Strength  returns
after  3d6 turns. A human or demihuman drained to zero Strength or hit points
by  an  ether shadow becomes a shadow of the type described in the  Monstrous
Manual and Monstrous Compendium.
Ether  Shadows  may  travel  freely through the ethereal  plane  to  manifest
themselves  as  apparitions on any bordering plane. They  have  no  power  to
materialize on those planes, so can neither physically affect nor be affected
by  anything on them. The only thing they can do is insinuate themselves into
and  control  the  dreams of any sleeper they discover   a power  that  lends
credence  to the notion that dreams are an other-planar experience. While  an
ether shadow may cause no actual harm to a dreamer, it can use this power  to
communicate  freely, or more likely to plague the dreamer with nightmares  of
the worst calibre.
In  order  to  combat an ether shadow, it's necessary to  follow  it  to  the
ethereal plane or to the plane on which it was originally created. On  either
plane,  it  is always partially materialized and may be affected  by  magical
weapons  and  by  all but a few spells (ether shadows are  immune  to  sleep,
charm, and hold spells, and all cold-based attacks).
An ether shadow can change its body at will into any shape it desires, though
that shape will always be made of the same shadow-stuff. It can also vary the
exact  shade  of  its  substance and so may appear as  the  three-dimensional
creature  it  is  rather  than  a patch of darkness  like  ordinary  shadows.
Regardless,  the ether shadow is always black or some shade of  grey.  If  it
chooses  to  remain its normal, featureless black, it is 90% undetectable  in
any light less bright than a continual light spell.
Ether  shadows are created in a dark ritual that divides a creature's essence
into  three parts, causing it to exist simultaneously on the ethereal  plane,
the negative material plane, and the prime material plane on which the ritual
was performed (other information on Erebus, the ether shadow of the Ghosts of
Mistmoor has been deleted).

This  spell is similar to insect plague, but the insects summoned  are  of  a
specific  type (with specific effects) depending on the priest's  deity,  for
example:

     Deity     Insect    Effect
     Beelzebub Flies     15% + 2% per level chance of causing disease
      Seth  Locusts    2 HP per round to creatures caught in the  swarm,  and
infestation of food

The  spell causes 3 HD of undead per 2 levels of the wizard to appear  within
range. They will obey his commands until slain, dispelled, or the spell ends.
The wizard may mix and match types as long as he does not exceed his Hit Dice
allotment.
The  necromancer  cannot summon a creature of more Hit Dice than  his  level.
Treat  a  +3  or better bonus to Hit Dice as the next die up, so a  wight  is
worth  5  HD,  a  wraith is 6, a mummy 7, a spectre 8,  and  a  vampire  (the
toughest undead that can be summoned) is worth 9 HD.

The  nearest  2d6 undead of Hit Dice equal to or less than the level  of  the
caster and within 100 foot per level of the priest, must travel to the caller
at  normal pace. The summoned undead will not be hostile, nor are they  under
the  control  of  the  summoner. They may act as they wish.  Once  they  have
arrived  at  the summoner, the undead may turn around and go back where  they
came  from, attack anyone in their way, talk to the summoner, or perform  any
other  action  that  seems  reasonable to them. Unthinking  undead  (such  as
zombies  and  skeletons) with a purpose immediately return to their  station.
Wandering,  unthinking undead stay and wait for orders (for which the  caster
needs  to use some form of undead control such as a potion, spell, or granted
power) unless there are obvious foes besides the summoner to attack.
The  summoner  must have bone dust that is scattered to the wind  during  the
spell casting.

This  spell  is  identical to the 1th-level summon  shadow,  except  that  it
conjures up one wraith for every three levels the wizard has attained.  These
monsters  are  under the control of the wizard until they are  slain  or  the
spell  expires.  If the wraiths are turned, they continue  to  serve  in  any
capacity  which  does  not require them to confront the priest  who  resisted
them. The material component of this spell is a piece of black jet.

This  powerful  spell superficially resembles a fireball;  instead  of  fire,
however,  the ball consists of solar radiance.All within the area  of  effect
suffer  1d10  HP  of  damage  per level of the  wizard.  Undead  and  similar
creatures  suffer  double damage. Creatures specifically harmed  by  sunlight
save  versus death magic or are slain instantly. If the saving throw is made,
they suffer the effects of 1 turn of full sunlight per level of the wizard.

The  material component is a golden sun symbol with a large topaz set in  the
centre. The symbol costs 2000 gp to make and is lost in the casting.

A  brilliant sword of fiery sunlight appears in the caster's hands when  this
spell is cast. The sword can be used without penalty for non-proficiency,  is
equivalent to a +3 weapon, inflicts 1d8+3 points of damage, and grants  a  +3
bonus  to  attack  rolls.  Blinding  rays emanate  from  the  flaming  blade,
subtracting   1 from an enemy's attacks, as long as the opponent  remains  in
melee.  The  sword does double damage to any creatures with a weaknesses  for
sunlight. The material component is a light source, which is extinguished  in
the casting.

is  light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without  penalty

round.
The  material  component  is a light source, which  is  extinguished  in  the

This  power  causes light to bend around the planet to a  specific
spot,  creating a 20 yard circle that is lit as if  the  sun  were
shining on it.  This will work in dungeons, underground, or in any
place that has an opening to the outside world.  It creates such a
change  in light, if used in a dark area, that people in the  area
will be blinded for 1 round while re-adjusting to the light.  This
power  will  also cause damage as per the sun to any sun-sensitive
creatures.  It CAN destroy vampires.

Power Score:  The radius of the circle of sun is doubled.

20:  The psionicist blinds themselves for 1d4 rounds.

This spell allows the caster to create a stationary wall composed of material
from  his  elemental plane of worship (templars may cast this  spell  in  any
form).  As  with  the  other elemental wall spells, superior  elemental  wall
covers a 20-foot-square area per level (the thickness varies depending on the
element); this area may be arranged in any manner to form a rectangular wall,
as  long  as neither dimension falls below 5 feet. While this set  of  spells
share common characteristics, such as duration and area of effect, the wall's
specific properties differ based on its composition.

     Element   Properties
      Air  Creates a wall of poisonous gas that is 20 foot thick. Treat as  a
cloudkill  (page  166, Player's Handbook), except that  the  vapours  from  a
superior  air wall are so toxic as to slay creatures with less than  5+1  Hit
Dice,  cause creatures with 5+1 to 6+1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws  versus
poison  with   4  penalties  or be slain, and creatures  up  to  7  Hit  Dice
(inclusive) to roll unmodified saving throws versus poison or be slain. Those
saving  versus  poison  and  those above 7 Hit  Dice  must  leave  the  cloud
immediately  or suffer 2d6 points of poison damage each round  while  in  the
area of effect (no saving throw allowed).
     Water     Creates a wall of steam that is six inches thick. Any creature
passing  though  a superior water wall suffers 6d8 points of  damage  plus  2
points  per level of the caster. In addition, a saving throw versus spell  is
required;  failure indicates that the creature is blinded  for  1d4+1  rounds
after  leaving  the wall. Attacks made through the wall are made  with  a   2
penalty.
     Fire Creates a wall of flames that is only inches thick. Treat as a wall
of fire (page 225, Player's Handbook), except creatures within 10 feet of the
side that radiates heat suffer 4d4 points of damage, and those within 20 feet
suffer  2d4  points of damage. A superior fire wall inflicts  8d4  points  of
damage  plus 2 points per level of the caster to any creature passing through
it.
      Earth     Creates a wall of stone that is 1 inch thick per level of the
caster.  Unlike the other versions of this spell, a superior  earth  wall  is
permanent  unless  destroyed. Treat as a wall of stone  (page  173,  Player's
Handbook).

The  material component is a bit of the element (air, water, fire, earth)  of
which the wall is composed.

This  is  a  much improved version of the 1st-level wizard spell  sleep.  The
creatures  affected  fall into a deep slumber from which they  cannot  awaken
from for at least one turn (unless a dispel magic is used).
For  each  creature  the wizard chooses to affect, a certain  amount  of  the
spell's  power is used to put the creature to sleep. An effect  die  roll  of
4d12  is made. This is the number of points that can be used to put creatures
to  sleep.  It  takes  a different number of points per  creature  to  put  a
creature to sleep, depending upon its Hit Dice or level. The wizard can  keep
on  putting creatures to sleep until all the points are used up, or there are
not  enough points left to affect another creature, or that all the creatures
are already asleep in the area of effect. The point costs are as follows:

     Hit Dice of Creature          Maximum   Average
     to be Affected Cost Affected  Affected
     up to «   «    96   60
     «+1 to 1  1    48   30
     1+1 to 3  2    24   15
     3+1 to 5  3    16   10
     5+1 to 7  4    12   7
     7+1 to 9  6    8    5
     9+1 to 10 12   4    2
     10+1 to 11     24   2    1
     11+1 to 12     30   1    1

Note:  As  an additional twist, the particular enchantments of this spell  do
not  allow  elves their normal resistance to sleep, but in turn  they  get  a
saving throw versus spell to avoid the effects of the spell.

The  material components of this spell is sand from a dead sandman  which  is
tossed in the air while the wizard sings a short lullaby.

This  spell  provides  other  spells with the energy  and  guidance  normally
supplied by material components. This spell gives the power to leave out  the
material  components  of other spells - unless it is to  be  an  item  to  be
enchanted:  you cannot enchant an item without the item you wish to  enchant.
The  caster  gains  one spell level per 2 caster levels, with  which  he  may
substitute  material  components for as many spells in  spell  levels.  These
spell levels are used up by the spells the caster chooses not to have a  need
for  material components: the 3rd-level fireball's material components  of  a
ball  of bat guano and phosphorous can be substituted for three spell  levels
from  this spell. Supply material component lasts until the last spell  level
of this spell is used up. They are cumulative with each other up to a maximum
stack  of 3 times the caster's level in spell levels. This spell may be  used
to  supply  the components for the future casting of this spell.  Note:  this
spell does not actually create the material components but only supplies  the
energy and guidance usually supplied by material components.

The  material component for this spell is difficult to provide: for the first
casting of this spell, the caster has to locate the very first spell book  he
owned  which still exists somewhere, rip out the first spell located  in  the
book, burn the pages, dissolve the ashes of the pages in acid, neutralise the
ashes with chalk dust until a paste is produced. This paste has to be applied
to  a  sapphire  of  no  less than 5000 gp until the sapphire  is  completely
covered. This is coated in clay. It then has to be burned in a kiln  to  rock
hardness.  In the casting, this "rock" has to crushed. For further  castings,
you  need  the second and further spells from the first spell book.  If  that
spell  book  is  used up, go to the next one, and so on...  Yes,  this  spell
rather quickly uses up those "unnecessary" spell books.

By  means  of  this  spell,  the wizard can temporarily  suppress  the  magic
resistance emanating from one creature or object, thus allowing other  spells
and  magical effects to have an increased chance of effect. The spell affects
one  creature or object and the area that its magic resistance protects.  For
example,  this  spell can be cast on a paladin wielding  a  holy  sword  that
provides magic resistance in a 5-foot radius, and the magic resistance can be
suppressed  in  the entire area of effect. If there are multiple  sources  of
magic resistance affecting the same area, this spell will only target one  of
them.
This  spell  can suppress up to 5% magic resistance per level of the  wizard.
Partial  effects are possible. For example, if a 10th-level wizard is casting
the  spell  at  a  creature with 80% magic resistance, that creature's  magic
resistance  will be lowered to 30% while this spell is in effect. Of  course,
this  spell  will  not  go into effect unless the creature  fails  its  magic
resistance roll.
The  wizard must maintain some concentration in order to preserve the spell's
effect.  The wizard may not perform any actions except moving at up  to  half
his  normal movement rate. If the wizard is successfully attacked,  then  his
concentration is also broken. If concentration is broken, the spell's effects
terminate immediately.
The  wizard,  however,  may choose to terminate the  spell  in  a  controlled
manner, and during the last round before the spell is terminated, the wizard,
in  addition to moving at up to half his normal movement rate, may also  cast
one  spell  whose  casting  time  is up to  one  round.  The  target's  magic
resistance  remains  lowered when making its resistance  check  against  this
spell.  Of  course, other wizards and devices may also cast spells while  the
target's  magic  resistance is lowered, and such  magic  does  not  terminate
suppress magic resistance.
This  spell  will totally negate a magic resistance spell if it is successful
at  suppressing  magic resistance of a percentage at least  as  high  as  the
percentage given by the magic resistance spell. In such a case, concentration
by the wizard is not necessary.

This spell suppresses the need for somatic components in other spells cast in
the  duration  given  above. The caster may choose whether  to  suppress  the
somatic  components or not. A spell with suppressed somatic components  takes
one  additional  unit of time to cast: one extra initiative modifier,  round,
turn,  hour, day, etc. (depending on the spell's original casting  time)  The
material  component for this spell are chain cuffs which have  been  used  to
chain a man over one year.

Upon casting this spell, the caster opens up a "personal" planar rift, within
his  own  body. The caster can choose any plane that he is aware of  and  has
material  from or related to (eg., a potion of healing would work to  connect
to  the  positive  material plane). This material is  considered  to  be  the
material component of the spell, and is consumed in the casting.
He  may  then emit energies from this plane at 12d6 damage. After a month  of
practice with this spell, the caster learns to duplicate planar phenomena  on
the prime material plane. This could mean: a wizard connects to the plane  of
fire  regularly, and after a month of practice he can cause fields to explode
into  fiery  combustion  at will (see the Manual of  the  Planes  for  planar
phenomena).
This  spell  is  about as "trademarked" as it could possibly be  non-legally:
only  Surge, the gold dragon Nexus, and Elminster know of it in the Forgotten
Realms  (both  are  good spell trading buddies). But, seeing  that  eight  of
Surge's spellbooks have taken to the wind, go ahead, make it about as rare as
wish.

This  Devotion allows the Psionic to suspend objects  in  the  air
around  him.  He must place the object where he wants it  to  stay
and  then let go of it, just tossing it into the general  area  of
where  he  wants it will not work.  The object will stay in  place
relative to the Psionic until either he retrieves it, does not pay
the maintenance cost, or some outside force changes its position.
      Example:  George the Psionic is carrying an object  in  each
hand when he sees a third object that he wants to pick up and take
with  him.  Using Suspend Objects he can place one or both of  the
objects he is carrying in the air around him and they will  follow
along with him until one of the above things happens.

Power Score:  The psionicist can either handle twice the number of
objects or objects of twice the weight.

20:   The objects will move rapidly in random directions until the
power is discontinued.

This  power requires at least two psionicists in convergence whose
total  levels must be 35 or higher, with no psionicist being below
level 9.  A successful use of this power requires every psionicist
in  the convergence to make a successful power check in the  round
the power is being initiated.
      This power works just like suspend animation, except that it
can be projected to some other creature, placing them in suspended
animation until the psionicists make another power check releasing
the  creature, or until the power expires in the manner  described
for suspend animation.

Power  Score:  The power lasts until the psionicists  release  the
creature with a successful power check.

20:   If  any of the psionicists roll a 20, the unlucky one  falls
into  an  involuntary  suspended animation until  revived  with  a
successful use of this power.

      When  cast on a willing creature who cannot swim, that being is granted
the  ability  to  swim  tirelessly for the duration  of  the  spell.  If  the
recipient  can swim, he tirelessly swims at double his normal swimming  speed
for  the duration of the spell. Note however, that this spell does not  grant
the  ability to breathe underwater. The material component is the fin of  any
fish, or the leg of any amphibian.

      This  spell  gives  the recipient the ability to swim  with  ease.  The
character  has  a  swimming  rate of 12 and can  carry  his  normal  load  of
equipment  with  no difficulty. A normally outfitted character  cannot  drown
while  this  spell is in effect. This spell does not impart  the  ability  to
breath underwater.

      The reverse of the spell, sinking, reduces the swimming ability of  the
target  by  one class if it fails its saving throw versus death  magic.  Thus
natural swimming creatures are treated as land creatures trained in swimming,
characters with swimming proficiency are treated as if they didn't have  this
ability, and non-proficient characters sink like stones.

The  material component of this spell is a scale from any fish (and  a  stone
for the reverse).

This  spell  creates  a  spectacular glowing sword, resembling  a  Star  Wars
lightsabre.  It  must  be cast on a handle of a steel sword,  which  must  be
especially fashioned or cut from a regular sword. The handle is not consumed.
A  second  component  is 1 gp worth of gold dust, which is  consumed  by  the
casting.  For the duration of the spell, a gleaming power blade is  projected
from the handle, which simulates a normal sword. The base damage it causes is
2d6  (for small and medium sized creatures) or 2d10 (for large creatures)  if
used  one-handed,  and  2d8  or 2d12 if used two-handed,  to  which  Strength
bonuses  and  magical  bonuses (if appropriate) are  added.  The  former  use
requires proficiency in one-handed sword (short or long) and the later in two-
handed   sword  (bastard  or  two-handed).  Further  special  abilities   are
determined by the level of the caster, as follows:

     Wizard's Level Special Abilities of Blade
     1-6  Not applicable
     7    Normal, non-magical sword
     8    Sword, +1
     9-10 Sword, +2
     11-12     Sword of sharpness, +2
     13-14     Sword of wounding, +2
     15+  Vorpal sword, +3

A  caster of above thirteenth level can specify which type the sword will  be
(of  the types available to lower levels). When subjected to physical  strain
the  blade  has double the strength of steel. If more pressure than  that  is
applied the spell is negated. If the handle leaves the hand of the caster the
spell  is  negated immediately. Because the sword of force is very  light  in
weight,  weapon speed is only 3 when used single-handed and 5 when used  two-
handed.  The material components of this spell are a handle of a steel  sword
(not consumed in the casting) and some gold dust.

This  spell  is  composed  of two 9th-level spells  which  have  to  be  cast
simultaneously. It creates, within a 10-mile radius, a condition in which the
symmetry between the physical interactions which prevailed at the time of the
big bang is restored. Everything within the 10-mile radius is instantaneously
gone  regardless of magic resistance, god or artifact status etc.  Everything
for a couple of hundred miles around gets burned, vaporised, melted etc. Note
that, like nuke, this spell has a range of zero, so use of long-range carrier
is advised.

This spell allows the caster to assume the form of any dragon the caster  has
personally  seen.  It grants all powers and abilities of  that  dragon  type.
Spells  can  be  cast while in dragon shape and take no material  components.
Items are still in effect while in dragon shape (if they are activated before
the  change or are continuous) after the change only items that be  activated
by  altered  speech and manipulative with claws can be used.  The  change  is
instantaneous  and  affects the person as a heal spell, but  the  hit  points
gained  remain only while in dragon form. Changing back returns half  of  any
hit points lost while in dragon form.
After using this spell several times Tabra has gained the reputation of being
a gold dragon in disguise as a human.

Taint  alignment  has  similar effects to a character as  performing  a  deed
opposite  to  his alignment, except that this one shows. Casting it  requires
knowing the true name of the target, which knowledge can be obtained by other
magic.  Casting  the  spell causes the target to make a saving  throw  versus
spell with a penalty of 2 on the die roll. If he makes the saving throw,  the
spell rebounds on the wizard, who will also have to save, but with a bonus of
2 on die. The spell will rebound between the two regardless of distance until
one  fails  a saving throw, or both have made three saving throws,  in  which
case  the spell fails. An affected true neutral character would get a  random
alignment of the one of the corner four alignments.
Effects  vary  depending  on the alignment of the  victim.  If  the  affected
humanoid  is a paladin, the effects thus far taken for granted are  reversed:
laying  on  hands  would cause damage, detect evil turns  into  detect  good,
remove  fear into cause fear. However, the paladin will have no idea what  is
happening until he tries to ride his mount or draw his holy avenger, +5.  For
an  anti-paladin, the effects are similar, but reversed with respect to  evil
and  good,  again having the opposite of the usual effects.  A  priest  would
instantly  lose  the ability to acquire spells, but not his  spellcasting  or
scroll-reading ability.
For any character, there are a number of standard effects:

     Know alignment shows the reversed alignment.
     Detect good or evil work as for the new alignment.
     Bad dreams.
      Problems  with other people. For a lawful good victim,  the  good  emit
fear, the evil get  liked, law is approached with caution, chaos is felt as a
sign of responsibility.
     Temples of one's own religion feel bad.
      There is a temptation to truly switch alignment fully, which would have
certain  effects described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, such  as  losing  a
level  of experience. A change in alignment can be felt by people in  contact
with the affected, more or less in the I-feel-something's-wrong way.

The curse cannot be magically removed with anything less than a limited wish,
until  the time is full. Of course, the target wouldn't know that the  effect
isn't permanent.
If  any  sign  of  faltering from the original alignment is given,  then  the
effect does become permanent. Slight faltering causes prolonged duration,  as
the  energy of the spell isn't as seriously tried to counter as it might have
been. The material component of this spell is a bit of India-rubber.

The  talking mist is similar in many aspects to a magic mouth and an  animate
mist spell. When a trigger occurs (as per magic mouth), a mist is created and
subsequently  animated. The animation is simple on lower wizard  levels,  but
the message which the mist can speak is always under 25 words.
All  other  effects  are detailed under animate mist  and  magic  mouth.  The
component  of  this  spell is the smoke from a burning paper  which  has  the
message written on it.

This  spell will cause the target's skin to tan. The touch can increase one's
tan  enough to cause 1d6 damage. The touch will either leave a nice tan  skin
that  covers  the body and goes away naturally, or   if damage  is  inflicted
the  skin  will  look  burned, and boils will form.  This  affect  goes  away
naturally as well. This spell can be used on male as well as female targets.

supply point. The spell is cast as the wizard names the desired component. If
the component is monetary, such as jewelry or powdered gems, twice the amount
required  in  gold pieces must be held in the wizard's hands during  casting,
that  is, 500 gp worth of powdered ruby requires 1000 gp or 1000 gp worth  of
gems or jewelry. The desired component will appear at the end of the casting.
Note:  the  component  will  not appear in a containment  vessel  if  one  is
required.  The  wizard must hold this in hand as well and the component  will
then appear in the held vessel.

This spell is actually two spells. The first version is used for spells,  the
second for affecting creatures directly.
The  first  version  has a casting time of two rounds. After  this  time  the
caster can choose up to one creature per 3 levels or up to 1 object per level
(or  a  respective mixture of objects and creatures). There are two  possible
effects of this selection:
1) These creatures and objects can be completely unaffected by area-of-effect
spells  of fifth level or lower within the sphere of this spell, as  long  as
these  spells  are cast by the caster of this spell. Thus, the  wizard  could
cast  this spell into an area (let's say in the throne room of his king)  and
protect his king from the area of effect of a fireball he is going to hurl at
the opponents of the king without affecting the king at all.
2)  These creatures could be affected first despite any contradicting reasons
of Hit Dice, size, etc. which are given in the additionally cast spell. Thus,
the  caster  could choose to use sleep and if he specifies the  ogre  captain
first,  then he would drop first (if the caster rolls good enough)  and  then
his underling kobolds would go to sleep after him. This would still not allow
a wizard to affect a creature with more than 4+3 HD wia normal sleep spell.
This  spell  is  not  mobile  and it cannot be  made  permanent.  Anyone  not
protected nor selected by this spell is affected normally by any spells  cast
by the caster of this spell.
The second version of this spell has a casting time of 2. It ensures that any
non-magical  missiles fired into the area of effect only hit  their  intended
targets  or  they miss completely - but even if a missile is fired  into  the
most chaotic melee, it still only hits its intended target or absolutely  no-
one,  unless the caster cannot protect enough creatures with this spell.  The
number  of creatures the caster can affect is one creature per 3 level.  This
version  of  the spell is mobile. If desired the caster can carry  the  spell
around with him to protect his fellow fighters from being hit by stray  shots
or  throws from his darts or daggers (those wizards are notoriously known for
fumbling at the worst of times, which means, exactly then when our courageous
fighter just starts to buckle under the onslaught of the opposing masses  and
he  just  has  the necessary hit points to survive - barely - but  then  that
stray  fumble  of 1 rerolls a critical backstab damage or something  of  that
kind!  So,  wizards, carry this spell around active with you and be protected
from the rage of your soon to be resurrected fighter companion...).

The material component is a lodestone of the size of a coin painted with red-
and-gold  target  circles  on  it (one per creature  or  ten  objects  to  be
protected) costing approximately 10 gp per lodestone.

This  spell is of short time duration because it is cast in tangent with  any
other  spell  that  the wizard has memorised. The target is  cast  first;  as
stated  above,  the  spell takes 18 seconds to cast. During  this  time,  the
wizard must take the material component of the spell (an ordinary arrow)  and
point it at one or more persons or items. The number of persons or items that
may  be  pointed  to is limited to twice the caster's Dexterity  (this  would
allow  a  normal person to point at 4 persons or items every 3 seconds).  For
each item pointed to, the caster takes 1 point of damage. At the end of these
18 seconds, the arrow disappears and each person or item pointed to begins to
glow  as  if  enchanted with faerie fire. At this point,  anti-magic  shells,
magic  resistance, etc. are checked (with magic resistance at  half  normal).
Anyone who is glowing at this point is left very vulnerable.
Now,  the  wizard casts any spell that can be cast on or cast at  someone  or
something  else (in the same round). Upon completing the spell,  everyone  or
everything which is glowing receives the effect of the spell. The caster also
takes  the level of the second spell in points of damage. The targets get  to
make their saving throws (if allowed) at this point. If the second spell  was
a  touch  spell,  the targets may add their Dexterity bonus to  their  saving
throw  (if  no saving throw was granted on that touch spell, the targets  get
one versus death magic with a successful saving throw indicating only half of
the  spell  effects  worked). Range 0 spells are  not  able  to  be  cast  in
conjunction with target.
The advantages of this spell are obvious. For example, in the first round  of
an  attack where the party is hopelessly overwhelmed, a wizard may be able to
cast  target  and give his entire party improved invisibility, thus  allowing
escape  or  a shift in the balance of the fight. A second example: there  are
two blue dragons bearing down on the party. They are flying close enough that
one  fireball  could  encompass both, but the caster  does  not  believe  one
fireball  will  do  it.  So he targets them both and each  is  crisped  by  2
fireballs (1 centred on each).

      When  cast upon a missile weapon, the weapon becomes more accurate.  It
gains  a  +1  bonus to-hit, and an additional +1 for every 4  levels  of  the
caster. For example, a 4th-level wizard confers a +2 bonus. The maximum bonus
is  +5.  It may only be used on normal missile weapons. In the case of  fired
weapons,  it  is cast on a single piece of ammunition. If the weapon  can  be
used as a melee weapon, it confers no bonus in melee combat. The weapon gains
no  bonus  to damage, speed factor, or ability to hit creatures only  hit  by
enchanted  weapons. Once the weapon has been shot, the bonus  is  lost,  thus
ending the spell.

With  the  Tattoo  power, a psionicist can draw intricate  designs
over  his  body, in several different colours. When the psionicist
stops  maintaining the power, his skin will return to normal.  The
one  round  of  preparation  time is used  by  the  psionicist  to
concentrate  on the exact details of the design.   This  power  is
well  known in primitive societies, where such designs often  have
to  do  with the situation or the intent of the person, and  where
designs  are often used during festivities. It can still be  quite
useful in adventuring situations, for example when there's need to
quickly copy a map painted on a wall.

Power Score:  the psionicist can change the design once while  the
power  is active, without paying the initial cost again (but  with
one more round of concentration).

20:   The  design becomes permanent, and can only  be  removed  by
normal  means  used to remove a tattoo (or with powers  which  can
affect the condition).

After  casting teeth and claws, the caster merely has to advance towards  his
intended  target,  baring his teeth and hands predatorily  before  tossing  a
tooth  or  claw at the target. If the creature fails its saving throw  versus
spell,  it  sees the advancing spellcaster as something or someone inimitable
and  flee.  What  follows is not entirely in its mind.  The  sound  of  claws
scrabbling  over  the  ground and teeth snapping are audible  to  all  within
hearing  range. Outside of the target's mind, teeth and claws has no physical
body aside from four sets of claws and a mouth full of teeth. Teeth and claws
is  90%  invisible  in shadows and darkness. It is fuelled  by  the  target's
imagination  and  fears, and continues pursuit until the target  successfully
disbelieves  in  it.  Therefore, doors and other barriers  would  only  delay
pursuit.  Teeth  and claws will pace and claw at the barriers.  Should  these
barriers  be  removed and the victim continues to believe in  it,  teeth  and
claws resumes pursuit. If it catches up with the target, it will attack as  a
1  HD  creature (4 claws at 1d2, teeth at 1d4). Teeth and claws can  only  be
attacked  with  +1  weapons  or better. The spell  expires  when  the  target
successfully  disbelieves it or if it takes 8 points of damage. The  creature
has  AC  4. The material component is the a tooth or claw from some predatory
creature  - prepare yourself- and turns to dust in either case. It  does  not
affect  the  phantasm's appearance because it has none outside of  teeth  and
claws.

This  spell  is  similar  Drawmij's scent mask  in  the  Greyhawk  Adventures
hardcover,  with  the  added benefit of not only masking  the  scent  of  the
recipient,  but  also  to  enable the target to smell  like  something  else.
However, the recipient is not immune to the smell, so don't make your friends
smell  like  troughs. The material component is a piece of what you  wish  to
make  the target smell like: skunk fur to freshen up your mother in law,  for
example.

This spell enables the wizard and his familiar to communicate mind-to-mind as
though   they  were  speaking  with  each  other.  It  provides  for  greater
understanding and depth of communication than is enabled by the empathic link

familiar  become separated by a distance greater than that allowed while  the
spell  duration  is still in effect, the spell does not wink out  but  begins
functioning again if the distance is closed.

This spell prevents teleportation into or out of the region specified by  the
wizard,  which  may be of any shape and any size, up to 1000 cubic  feet  per
level of the abjurer. No character can enter or leave the region by means  of
dimension  door, teleport, or other-planar travel. Teleportation  within  the
region  is not restricted, and teleport without error has a chance of success
equal to 1% per level of the wizard, though it has the same chance of failure
as  a  regular teleport attempted under normal conditions. A wish  will  also
provide  transportation  across the boundary,  as  of  course  will  walking,
riding, and flying.
Any attempt to teleport or dimension door across the block will automatically
fail; all memory of the spell will be lost; and the wizard must make a system
shock check or be killed by the shock of the rebound. Attempts at transplanar
travel  will  also  fail,  but not in so dramatic  a  fashion.  The  material
component is a glass globe.

This  power is identical to Teleport Other, except that it's  used
to  bring  another character to within 10 yards of the psionicist.
The  character must be within one yard of the target place of  the
power, and if there is more than one person within that range, the
power  fails, with the exceptions noted below. The character  must
be  willing to be teleported or unconscious. PSP costs  and  power
score  modifications  are the same as for  teleportation.  If  the
psionicist  pays twice the usual PSP cost, he can teleport  up  to
three characters, all standing within the one yard radius area  of
effect. If more than three people stand within the area, the power
fails, with the exceptions mentioned.
      If  the psionicist is in either visual or telepathic contact
with the subjects of the teleport, they can be teleported even  if
more  people are standing in the target area. So if, for  example,
the psionicist has a Clairvoyance contact with the targets, he can
choose  the  persons he wants to be teleported. It  will  also  be
easier for him to choose the target place, so all will fit in  the
radius,  if  possible.   Note that to  choose  the  targets  using
telepathy, the psionicist must have contact with all the  subjects
of  the  power. If there are four people in the target  area,  for
example, and the psionicist has a link with two of them, he  could
only  teleport  these two people. Attempting to take  one  of  the
other two will cause the power to fail.

Power Score:  The PSP cost is reduced by 20 percent, rounded up

20:   All  would-be  teleporters are seriously  disoriented.  They
cannot  cast spells and suffer a -4 penalty on all die  rolls  for
1d4 turns.

This  power allows a psionicist to "lock" onto another being,  and
if  that being should teleport (magically or psionically) for  any
reason,  the psionicist will have the option that round, and  that
round only, to teleport to the same place as the "locked" creature
did.   If the psionicist opts not to immediately follow, the  lock
is  lost.  The lock needs to be made while the psionicist can  see
the   creature  it  is  locking  onto,  but  after  the  lock   is
established, distance between the two makes no difference.
      If  the psionicist decides to follow, the character must pay
the  PSP  costs  and  make a power check as  he  would  using  the
Teleport  power,  with  all the appropriate penalties  based  upon
distance.  If the psionicist does not have enough PSPs,  then  the
Teleport fails.

Power  Score:   The lock lasts for 5 rounds after  the  locked  on
character has teleported.

20:  No other effect.

The  wizard  casts  this spell on a character or creature who  is  likely  to
teleport  or  employ similar magic in the near future. If the recipient  does
cast teleport (or dimension door, word of recall, etc.), then the wizard  who
placed  the  teleport  trace  will receive a mental  image  of  the  target's
location.  The caster of teleport trace will then know his location  relative
to  that  of the teleportee, and he will be able to use his own teleportation
or scrying magic with maximum accuracy.

Teleport  tracer  allows  the  wizard to  follow  the  faint  trail  left  by
teleporting  creatures.  The tracer tells the wizard  where  the  teleporting
creature  went  to, within a few blocks, or several miles in the  countryside
(less accurate for longer distances, only very general information for multi-
planar  travel).  If the wizard so chooses, he can teleport along  the  exact
same route, but this must be done on the round after the tracer is cast,  and
multi-planar movement is not possible in this manner. The tracer must be cast
within  one turn of the original teleport, and this teleport must have  taken
place  within  the range of this spell. This spell is also effective  against
word of recall and dimension door spells, or non-magical (psionic) teleports,
but not true dimension travel or plane shifting.

All  people  or  things  teleporting  into  the  area  of  effect  are,  upon
materialising, affected as if a paralysis spell had been cast upon  them  (as
in  the  Player's  Handbook). Thus, a wizard wishing to sneak  into  a  place
decides  to teleport there. However, he doesn't realise that a teleport  trap
has  been  cast around the spot where he wishes to appear. Upon arriving,  he
must  save  versus spell or be paralysed. Those leaving an  area  under  this
spell will also be paralysed, wherever they appear.
Material  components are a gem of not less than 5000 gp worth,  smeared  with
the ichor of some paralysing agent (ghoul's skin, for example).

This spell causes all creatures teleporting into or out of the area of effect
to  arrive in a prepared area. The area which the wizard wishes the  affected
creatures to appear in must also be in the area of effect.
The space the wizard wishes incoming teleportees to arrive at must be an open
area,  free  from  objects. It can be in the air, however,  causing  incoming
creatures  to  fall. Should a creature teleporting into an area  affected  by
this  spell  be  larger  than  the area he would  be  sent  to,  then  he  is
effectively blocked and would not be able to teleport at all to the area.
An  example: the archmage Istle casts teleport warp on his tower.  He  wishes
all people who unexpectedly arrive to be placed in his dungeon cell which  is
10x10x10 feet. The cell is also in the area of effect, at the bottom  of  his
tower,  which totally is under the spell. Thus a person who teleports to  his
tower will arrive in a dungeon cell instead of the wizards guest chambers. If
Golstein  the  Chaotic decides to send his 18 foot tall iron  golem  over  to
Istle's bed chamber, he will find the golem still there, unmoved.
All  forms  of  teleport  magic are affected, thus  dimension  door,  pattern
teleports, and the like also would be warped. This is a great spell  for  the
wizard wishing to block an area for outside aid coming in short of all planar
travel.

The  material  component is a lodestone which must be placed in the  location
the wizard wishes teleportees to arrive. It is consumed upon casting.

This  spell allows the wizard to teleport himself or others from one area  of
flames to another (both fires must be at least as large as a small campfire).
The  wizard  has  two options: if the terminal fire is in sight,  this  is  a
teleport without error as per the spell of the same name; if the target  fire
is  not in sight, then the teleport is subject to the success modifiers of  a
normal  teleport. Obviously, the location of the terminal fire must be  known
(via  scrying  or prior knowledge). If this spell is used when  there  is  no
known  target fire (i.e. there is no fire in sight and none are known to  the
wizard) the recipients are trapped on the elemental plane of fire (note  that
this provides a way of entering this plane on a planned basis, but the wizard
will  not know the location of the teleport beforehand, unless there is prior
knowledge of the location on the plane of fire).
This  spell will provide the recipients with a form of fire-resistance:  this
resistance lasts for one round per 2 levels of the wizard; it provides  total
protection  for  this  time (but only for the two fires  in  question  -  the
recipients are affected normally by other fires during this time).
It  takes 2 turns to prepare this spell, but once prepared, it will remain in
effect  for  one  hour  per level of the wizard, or until  it  is  used.  The
creatures to be affected are named at the time of preparation. The spell  has
an actual casting time (i.e. to trigger the teleport) of 1.
This spell provides a method of escaping the effects of a fireball or similar
spell:  if the wizard makes the proper saving throw, and is not in the  midst
of some other activity (i.e. casting another spell or fighting), the teleport
can  be  triggered instantly; the teleported creatures are unaffected by  the
fireball  regardless  of whether they make their saving  throws  or  not.  Of
course, the normal stipulations are still in effect, so the wizard must still
have a target fire, or be trapped on the plane of fire.

The  material  components for this spell are a candle and the  replica  of  a
small, wooden door; both are consumed with the casting.

This spell conjures a dimensional door, either on a solid surface or anchored
by  some  sort  of substance. Two hundred and fifty pounds per level  of  the
wizard  can enter through the door to another place, but the wizard  must  be
the  last  person  to  pass  through. The door will automatically  extinguish
itself  in one minute if the wizard is not yet through. The door can lead  to
any  location  the  wizard desires which is within fifty feet  per  level  of
wizard. The location may be either visualized from memory or may be given  as
directions  if the wizard has no visual memory of the location. If  the  door
leads into a solid object, material creatures and objects will not be able to
pass through the door.
After  the wizard has passed through, the doors will disappear. If the wizard
does not pass through the door within one minute, the doors will disappear as
well. In this case, all objects that have passed through will be lost to  the
ethereal plane, while creatures that have passed through will return  to  the
location of the first door they have passes through.
Note  that  this  spell does not enable individuals to teleport  to  or  from
magically sealed locations. The material components for this spell are a gem,
worth at least 5000 gp and the tail of a rattlesnake.

      This  spell creates a glowing footprint to appear wherever  the  victim
steps.  The footprints can only be seen by the caster (there is also a  fifty
percent  chance that creatures with infravision may see them  as  well).  The
footprints  will  last  for the full spell duration (changing  shoes  doesn't
help). A dispel magic will remove the footprints.

The  material component for this spell is a single berry. The berry  must  be
thrown  at  the  victim immediately following the vocal  component  for  this
spell. The berry must strike the victim for the spell to work.

This  spell  is  a highly improved version of wall of force. It  is  used  to
create a barrier which cannot be penetrated by any known spells or forces  in
the multiverse, including major powers, avatars, devils, or demon princes.
The casting time of 1 hour is standard, but the wizard must also spend a hour
in contemplation, reviewing diagrams or charts of the area or object to which
the  force layer is to be attached when memorising the spell. Force layer may
cover  an  area  of  up to 10x10 feet, and must be attached  to  a  localised
gravity: either an object, a structure, or an area. Once cast, only spells of
wish-like power may affect the force layer.
Limited  wish  will affect the force layer as a half-strength  dispel  magic;
alter  reality will affect the force layer as a _ strength dispel magic,  and
wish  will affect the force layer as a full strength dispel magic. The  force
layer  may  be attached to moving objects, but only those which  are  of  one
piece  and move in conjunction to something else. For example, a chest  (with
hinges)  could  be covered, but the chest would still need to  have  a  break
within the spell effect, so only the top or the bottom of the chest would  be
affected.  Placing  the  spell on a wagon would effectively  make  the  wagon
indestructible, but the wagon would never again roll since the wheels are now
locked  in  place. But, if the wheels alone (and possibly  the  axle  if  the
wizard  was inventive) were protected the wagon would still roll. Of  course,
after  the wheels eventually rotted away in a few years the spell area  would
still be in effect and invisible wheels would still roll.
When  this  spell  is  cast on the prime material plane the  area  of  effect
extends  into the astral and ethereal planes, although the force  layer  will
still be invisible. Nothing will stick to the Telnorne force layer except for
another force layer which is attached to a previously cast one. Paint,  dust,
and  powders  will simply roll off its surface. Only dust of appearance  will
stick to the force layer, and then only for 1d10 rounds.

This  spell, unsurprisingly, creates bolts of fire. That may be a single from
the  caster to one target, or any number of independently targeted bolts,  up
to  one per level. If fired at one person, damage is 1d6 + 1 per level of the
caster.  If fired at multiple targets, the damage is 1d6 per bolt (more  than
one  bolt can be fired simultaneously at a target giving an xd6 total damage,
but  only one saving throw is made and the additional damage comes into  play
only if there is but a single bolt).
This  spell's  advantage  over fireball is its ability  to  strike  only  the
desired  targets  during melee. Its level is higher  due  to  the  fact  that
thousands of wizards have spent centuries refining fireball, making it easier
to cast whereas this spell is considered very rare.
Material components are as for fireball whilst somatic are both hands crossed
at  the  wrists  in front of the body swept rapidly apart. Intervening  solid
objects between caster and target take damage instead of the target.

This  discipline allows the psionic to alter the flow of the  time
stream  relative to their body.  Upon successfully  applying  this
discipline  the psionic effectively alters the flow  of  the  time
stream relative to his body.  The psionicist gains the ability  to
move  his  or her body in a fashion that is identical  to  someone
under  the effect of a Haste spell.  Unlike the recipient  of  the
Haste  spell  the  psionic  does NOT  age  one  year  due  to  the
application of this discipline. The increased speed does not allow
the  psionic  to either cast multiple spells/round or active  more
psionic powers/round than would otherwise be allowed.
     This discipline cannot be used in conjunction with magic that
affects  time  stream  (haste, slow, potion of  speed,  etc.).  If
already  under the influence of one of these types  of  magic  the
psionicist  will  be  totally unable to  activate  this  devotion.
Conversely, when this discipline is under affect the psionicist is
immune to the effects of these magics.

Power  Score:  The psionicist gains the ability to move at  triple
speed.

20:   The psionicist acts as if under the effect of a Slow  spell,
and cannot terminate this condition for 5 rounds.

This  discipline allows the psionic to alter the flow of the  time
stream  relative to their body.  Upon successfully  applying  this
discipline  the  psionicist's body passes into a  state  which  is
indistinguishable from death (except by casting of a  Detect  Life
spell).  The  Psionicist can maintain that state  until  either  a
predetermined  amount  of  time has passed  (say  10  days)  or  a
specific   event   triggers  the  termination  of   the   temporal
deceleration.   While  in the decelerated  state  the  psionic  is
oblivious to the outside world (everything is a blur traveling too
fast  to  follow),  and  his body uses up none  of  it's  internal
resources,  ie., his metabolism stops, so no healing takes  place,
but neither does a bad physical condition worsen. There is nothing
to   prevent  physical  harm  from  befalling  the  psionic  while
temporally decelerated.
     This discipline cannot be used in conjunction with magic that
affects  time  stream  (haste, slow, potion of  speed,  etc.).  If
already  under the influence of one of these types  of  magic  the
psionicist  will  be  totally unable to  activate  this  devotion.
Conversely, when this discipline is under affect the psionicist is
immune to the effects of these magics.

Power  Score:  The psionicist hears, sees and remembers  all  that
transpires  within normal sensory range for the  duration  of  his
temporal deceleration.

20:  The psionicist is decelerated for twice as long as expected.

Some of you might remember this spell from the first edition Unearthed Arcana
book.  It is almost the same spell with the exceptions noted above and below.
For  those  of you who don't know it, a short description first:  this  spell
causes  a  distortion  of time in the minds of the characters,  so  that  any
character in the area of effect ages 6 times as fast but he also regains  hit
points 6 times as fast and he also rests 6 times as fast: for a character  in
the area of effect, ten minutes of real time pass whereas he perceives a full
hour to pass. This spell works for spell casters to rest normally during  its
duration. Thus, two real hours of sleep would equal 12 hours of sleep in  the
area of effect. The casting time is actually a lot shorter, but it takes  the
full  10  rounds of casting time for the organism to change to the high-speed
effect of the normal tempus fugit version.
As  combat  normally requires concentration on the outside this spell  is  no
good for combat purposes. It is also not possible to use it in the middle  of
combat  unless the targets of this spell normally are to concentrated on  the
outside so they immediately penetrate the illusion and cause it to vanish for
themselves.  It  is thus also not possible to have someone  sit  as  a  guard
during  the  effect  inside the area of effect as he or  it  is  supposed  to
purposefully watch the surrounding world (in short, this spell cannot be used
during or in the preparation for combat).
The  reversed version, speude bradeoos, takes effect immediately but  it  has
the full casting time of one turn. It is not possible to cast spells from the
inside to the outside in a high speed effect as in that case the caster would
have  to concentrate on the outside world. As the illusion is a rather feeble
one  in  respect  to  penetrating  it, this causes  the  illusion  to  vanish
instantly for the person concentrating on the outside of the area of  effect.
When  under  the influence of the reverse, a full hour would be perceived  as
being only ten minutes, etc. In this version, characters that have been under
the effect of this spell need a full ten minutes to recover from the effe  as
their  reactions are so greatly slowed. This version you can  use  in  combat
(but note the casting time).
Both spells are cumulative with each other up to a maximum of one spell per 5
levels of the caster and both spells can be affected by permanency. It is not
possible to layer several spells from different casters over the same area.

The  material component for the normal spell is sand from an hourglass  which
has  been  used  for more than one year without ever having stood  still  for
longer  than  a  six  seconds. The reversed spell  needs  the  sand  from  an
hourglass that has not been touched for over six years.
Note:  this  spell  affects only an area. Thus, it does  not  move  with  the
caster.  The  area has to be solid ground (of at least one foot thick),  thus
not  every little carpet could be used, but if you could get solid ground  to
move,  well,  you could have some permanent and cumulative spell recuperation
zones that could be moved...

This spell improves the martial prowess of the wizard. All melee attacks made
by  the  wizard  are at the usual chance to hit, but every successful  attack
does maximum normal damage to the opponent for the duration of the spell. The
spell  only  affects hand-held melee weapons and hurled weapons, not  device-
propelled missile weapons. The material component is a set of tiger claws.

This  spell  focuses the priest's spells through her tentical rod  (minor  or
major)  for the duration of the spell. The effect of this spell is  that  the
priest's  touch  spells are allowed multiple chances  to  strike  the  target
(note:  multiple  tentical foci still allow the spell  to  take  effect  only
once).  The  damage from the tentical rod is still calculated  normally.  The
material components for this spell are the priest's tentical rod and her holy
symbol.

This  is  an  advanced form of fear. When terror is cast,  an  invisible  ray
shoots from the wizard's hand to the target, never missing. A new ray follows
each round, unless the wizard undertakes another action. The victim must save
versus spell with a -2 penalty or be affected as follows: creatures of  6  HD
or  less immediately die of fright; those of 6+1-8 HD collapse to the  ground
for  6  full  turns in utter terror, refusing to notice any outside  presence
except  a  physical  attack (if attacked they fight back  in  berserk  fury);
8+1-10  HD  creatures flee in panic for one round per level  of  the  caster,
automatically dropping whatever they were holding; creatures of  10+1  HD  or
greater flee in panic for one round per level of the caster but only  have  a
25% chance to drop what they were holding.
The  wizard  can shoot forth one ray for every three levels he has  obtained,
rounded  down.  Only  one  ray  can be issued per  round.  Undead  and  those
creatures with protection against fear are also immune to terror.

By  use  of  this  spell the wizard causes a concentrated point  of  positive
energy, from the material plane of energy, to build up to critical mass which
takes one round. Once critical mass is reached the energy build up will cause
an explosion doing 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster to all within
the  area  of effect. All characters get a saving throw for half damage.  The
component  for  this spell is a perfect crystal of at least  2000  gp  value,
which is consumed in the explosion.

When  this  spell is cast a magical door outline, only seen by the  wiz  will
appear one foot in front of the wizard. The wizard then may enter through the
outline  (the  wizard is the only one able to enter the  doorway).  Once  the
wizard  walks  through  the outline he will see a nice sized  furnished  room
(20x20x20  feet).  While in this room the wizard will be able  to  heal,  re-
memorise spells, sleep (safely), or do anything else he is normally  able  to
do, with the exception of new spell study, or the casting of any other spells
than  healing spells. If an attempt to do this is made the room will explode,
doing 30d20 HP of damage to the wizard.
The  wizard may stay in this room for 2 hours + 1 hour per level, but as soon
as  he leaves he will have been gone for only 1 second per hour spent in  the
room (for example, Murlock, a 24th-level wizard casts this spell and spends a
whole  day within the room, but when he leaves the room his companions  state
that  he has been gone for exactly 24 seconds). If a wizard is still  in  the
room  when the spell's duration has come due, the wizard must make  a  saving
throw  at  -5 or be hurled into the void (note: the wizard does age  normally
when in the room).

The  material  component  for  this spell is 50  gp  value  of  each  of  the
following: diamonds, rubies, ivory and jade.

By  means  of this spell, the wizard places a number of spells "on hold"  for
the  next day. The spell is intended for casting at night, before sleep.  The
held spells are stored in the wizard's memory for the evening undisturbed. If
the  wizard  is  awoke,  the spells are available to him,  and  are  used  up
normally  when cast. In the morning, the spells are still retained, and  will
remain with the wizard as though he had spent the time to memorise them  that
morning.
The  wizard  may retain a number of spell levels equal to 9 +  2  per  wizard
level  (i.e., a 9th-level wizard may retain 27 spell levels worth of spells).
The  material component is any form of headpiece (hat, hairnet,  comb,  skull
cap,  whatever) and must be specially enchanted by the caster of  the  spell.
The  cost to construct this item is 500 gp. The item must be worn both  while
memorising the spells to be retained, and when the Hold spell is cast, though
not while casting the spells.
Note  that because a cast spell is lost as per usual, the Nimbleton hold must
itself  be memorised and cast every day (therefore, a 9th-level wizard  saves
himself 270 minutes memorisation time in the morning, but at some other  time
during the day must spend 50 minutes to memorise and cast the hold. Thus, his
total savings are 220 minutes, or three hours and forty minutes. In addition,
the  wizard  may  defend himself with the held spells  during  the  night  or
morning before memorising the next day's list).

Monster  servant binds a creature to the caster's will. The  spell  does  not
grant  any form of communication, so the wizard and the monster must be  able
to  communicate for the spell to work. All humans, demi-humans, and creatures
with  an Intelligence greater than 10 are immune to the effects of the spell.
Wisdom bonuses to saving throws apply if the monster actually has Wisdom.
An  affected  creature will do anything for the caster, including sacrificing
its life. The spell's duration is similar to that of charm person, but the DM
should modify this as he wishes. When the creature is told to place itself at
risk, a new saving throw should be rolled.
But  now  for  the  fun part: this obviously overpowered spell  has  a  mayor
drawback:  whenever  the  spell is cast, there is a  chance,  equal  to  (the
target's Hit Dice - the caster's Wisdom bonus) divided by 20, that the  spell
drives  the  caster insane, and also subjects him to the creature's  will  at
that point in time. Note that the spell still functions normally as well,  so
if  the  creature  was wishing that the caster would be his  slave,  and  the
caster went insane, but the creature failed its saving throw, they would both
be each other's slave.
Also,  keep in mind that a caster with an 18 Wisdom could cast this spell  on
creatures  of  up to 4 HD, and as his Wisdom bonus is 4, there  would  be  no
chance of insanity.
This  curse  was not built into the spell, but was a side effect. The  wizard
that researched it did not put in a limitation on the target's Hit Dice,  and
drew  the  energy to enslave the creature from her own will power. Therefore,
when  she  tried it on a creature of 14 HD, she didn't have the willpower  to
overcome it, and went crazy. Actually, she became its mate, thinking she  was
a  fire  giant. That's what the creature was looking for when  she  cast  the
spell...

When cast, this spell creates a horse within 10 feet of the wizard. The horse
can  pass  over  nearly  any surface and even fly short  distances  (levelx20
feet).  The  horse lasts ¬ day per level of the wizard, or until  the  wizard
loses  consciousness. The horse can run at speeds up to 40.  The  steed  will
respond  perfectly  to the wizard. It has 10 hit points  +  2  per  level  of
wizard, and can be hit only by +2 or better weapons.
As  the  power of the wizard increases, so does the appearance of  the  steed
change, i.e., a 9th-level wizard would get a good steed, a 20th-level  wizard
would  get  a pegasus or similar creature. It can kick for 1 to the  wizard's
level  hit points in damage. The steed is immune to magical attacks  such  as
fireball,  lightning  and magical ice. The material component  is  a  bridle,
which disappears with the horse at the end of the spell's duration. All metal
parts of this bridle must be silver.

Failing  a  saving throw (at -2) results in the bones of the  victim  growing
massive  bone spurs that tear out through the flesh for 1d6 per level damage,
attempting to move (for spell duration) inflicts an extra point of damage per

This  spell creates an invisible force that is 3 feet deep over the  area  of
effect.  This forces simulates thick mud. Creatures wading through  the  area
that  is  mired  must save versus spell or be stuck for the duration  of  the
spell. A successful saving throw means that the creature can move through the
area at half the normal rate and loses half its Dexterity bonuses while doing
so.
Those  stuck simply can't move their legs and lose all Dexterity  bonuses  to
Armour  Class,  but they can still move their bodies above  the  3-foot  high
area.  So,  the force will not stop an elven archer using his bow,  but  will
stop a halfling swinging his sword.
Obviously, very large creatures are not affected nor are flying creatures  in
most  cases. The material component is a small clay tile that was laced  with
spider webs when made. It can be reused.

This  spell is similar to the wizard spell thunder staff, with the  exception
that  the priest needs no material components. Upon completion of the  spell,
the priest claps his hands together and produces a thundering cone of force 5
feet  wide  at  the  apex, 20 feet wide at the base, and 40  feet  long.  All
creatures  and objects wholly or partially in the cone incur the  effects  of
thunder staff as printed in the Tome of Magic (pages 32 33).
While  the  priest  must  have  both  hands  free  to  cast  the  spell  most
effectively, he can cast it with only one hand. This case might occur if  the
other hand is bound, missing, or holding a shield, for example. If the caster
only  has one hand free, he may clap it against bare skin on any part of  his
body (thigh, cheek, etc.). The resulting cone of force is 2® foot wide at the
apex,  10  feet wide at the base, and 20 feet long. All creatures  wholly  or
partially in the cone must roll a successful saving throw versus spell. Those
who  fail are stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d3 1 rounds (they  cannot
be  deafened  for less then 1 round, however). Those creatures who  fail  are
also hurled 2d4+2 feet by the wave of force, suffering 1 point of damage  per
two feet thrown (damage will always be 2d4+2, even if the creature encounters
an intervening surface). If the saving throw is successful, the victim is not
stunned,  but  is  deafened for 1d3 1 rounds and  is  hurled  only  half  the
distance. Giant-sized creatures or larger who succeed at their saving  throws
are  deafened but are not thrown, suffer no damage, and are not  stunned.  If
the  saving  throw is failed, they are hurled 1d4+1 feet, suffer 1  point  of
damage per two feet thrown, and are deafened and stunned.
Regardless of whether one or two hands are used in the casting, the cone  has
a  Strength  of  19  for the purposes of opening doors. It can  move  objects
weighing  up  to 640 pounds 4d4+4 or 2d4+2 feet, depending on the  method  of
casting.  Fragile items must make a saving throw versus crushing blow  or  be
destroyed.

When  the spell is cast, a ball of fire (like a fireball) blossoms, that does
10  points of damage. If the victims fail their saving throw, they  are  also
stunned  for  1 round per level, because thunderball also hits  them  like  a
concussion  grenade.  Because  of  the concussion  aspects,  things  such  as
skeletons  are  also affected. A very simple spell, but not one  to  be  used
underground, as the concussion could cause a cave in. The material  component
is rain water from thunderstorm.

At  the  completion  of this spell, a powerful sound wave emanates  from  the
caster in a deafening boom. All creatures (excluding caster) must save versus
death  magic or be stunned for 1 round per 3 levels of the caster's  ability.
Creatures making a successful saving throw are deaf for 2 rounds per level of
the  caster (as per magic missile). Stunned creatures fall to the ground  and
are  incapable of any actions. The material component is a bit of  ash  of  a
tree struck by lightning.

This  power  allows the psionicist to speed up or slow  down  time
with  regards  to the target creature.  At the time the  check  is
made,  the psionicist declares by how much the time flow  will  be
increased  or  decreased.  In other words, how  many  rounds  will
occur  for  the  target creature while a single round  of  'normal
time'  passes  (or alternatively how many rounds of 'normal  time'
will  pass  in what the target  creature sees as a single  round).
The power scores and initial/maintenance costs are given below.

Speed up/ Power Score    Initial/maintenance Prerequisite
slow down penalty   cost (see note)     Level
factor
2    3    10/5 5
3    4    20/5 10
4    5    30/5 15
5    6    40/5 20

      Note: The power can only be maintained if the psionicist  is
the  affected creature.  The costs are relative to the psionicists
time  frame, in other words the initial cost is relative to normal
time  (and will affect the target creature for one round of normal
time),  while  the maintenance cost is relative to  the  new  time
frame,   and   must  be  paid  for  every  round  the   psionicist
experiences.  A 20th level psionicist  for  example, who speeds up
time by a factor of 5, would  not have to pay maintenance cost for
the  first five rounds (or 1 round  'normal  time') since this  is
covered   by  the  initial  cost.   After  these  5  rounds,   the
maintenance  cost  would be 5 per round (or 25  per  round  normal
time).   Since  this power affects the flow of time,  rather  than
speeding up the metabolism of the target creature, as is the  case
with magical haste for example, no aging will result.  Anyone  who
returns  to  the normal time frame however, will be  confused  and
unable  to  do  anything for as many rounds as were spend  in  the
other  time frame.  This gives the body time to readjust to normal
time  and  recover from the strain.  It is possible to  force  the
body  to  ignore  to  ignore  this time of  recovery.   To  do  so
requires  a Wisdom check and a Constitution check, with a  penalty
equal  to  the factor by which time was affected for both  checks.
If  either  is  failed, 1d6 random ability scores are  permanently
lowered by one.  In other words, this is not a good idea except in
the most desperate cases.

Power Score:  The psionicist may increase the time factor by  one,
without having pay the extra cost in PSP's.

20:   The  psionicist  is  confused and disoriented  as  described
above.

Using this devotion, the psionicist can cause time to speed up  or
slow  down  for himself only. Thus, the psionicist  can  exist  at
twice  the  speed  of the rest of the world, or  half  the  speed,
effectively  hasting or slowing himself. Because the  increase  or
decrease  in  speed  is  time  oriented  instead  of  biologically
oriented,  the psionicist can perform ALL actions at either  twice
or  half  normal  speed. For example, a psionicist  can  make  two
psionic actions per round, use two magic items per round,  etc;  a
slowed psionicist could take only  one action every two rounds.
      There are some other unique qualities of this ability. There
is  no  metabolic  change, like the aging associated  with  haste.
Spells  and  psionic  powers are affected, so  if  the  psionicist
increases his speed, spell duration is only half of what it  would
be  in  normal time, but an initiative bonus of 3 is gained  while
the  power is in effect. For example, a protection from evil spell
cast  on the psionicist that would last 8 rounds of real time will
now  last only 4 rounds. On the other hand, if a psionicist  slows
himself, spells last twice as long as they would in real time, but
there  is an initiative penalty of 3 while being slowed down.  For
example,  a  slow  poison cast on a slowed psionicist  would  last
twice as long as normal. The PSP cost in real time for any psionic
abilities outside the Time Flux (ie, not affecting the psionicist)
does  not  change, but the cost for those abilities affecting  the
caster is increased or decreased appropriately.
Numerous applications exist for this power. If a psionicist  wants
to  "burn  off"  a harmful spell (like slow or hold  person),  the
speeding  up usage would help greatly. Likewise, if the psionicist
wants  a  spell to remain longer than normal (in real time),  then
the slowing use is best.

Power Score:  Once during the maintenance the psionicist can  time
shift  himself one round into the future with no chance of failure
or  disorientation. The psionicist does not need to know the  time
shift  for this effect to occur.  If the psionicist does  in  fact
know  time  shift,  then he can try to move two  rounds  into  the
future  as if it were only one round (but with standard chance  of
failure).

20:   The psionicist is stopped in time for 1-4 rounds, unable  to
react, but can be injured. For game purposes, all attacks hit  and
all saves are failed.

This  spell  actually  sends characters back or forward  in  time.  They  can
actually  affect the flow of time as they have been merged  with  it  by  the
power of this spell. The characters can travel back or forward up to one year
per  hour of casting time devoted in the casting. The casting time has to  be
continuous,  and may not be interrupted. As the time a normal  character  can
cast  spells continuously isn't very long, this means that not too many years
can  be spanned with this spell. If one the other hand the character does not
have to eat, drink or rest quite impressive times can be spanned.

The material components for this spell are:
          one bone from every magically inclined race on the planet no matter
how old - even if extinct;
           the sacrifice of a fully charged staff of the magi which has to be
broken  apart  (yes, roll for your survival, if you don't  survive  this  the
spell fails completely);
           the  creation  of something utterly and completely new  which  has
never  been used or created before, costing no less than 1000 gp per year  to
be travelled in time (this item has to be useful and not complete bogus); and
           the  life  of  the  caster (the caster is  completely  annihilated
including  body,  soul  and spirit, so that not even gods  can  resurrect  or
reincarnate him).
Thus,  this spell is not cast very often by the same caster (actually, it  is
cast  only once by a caster). And most casters are rather reluctant  to  cast
it.
DMs: be careful with this spell. It gives your characters very much power, if
they  can  think  of the way to circumvent the last material component.  They
could  create  for themselves quite some fortresses, if they are  smart,  and
they can defeat almost every opponent by going back in time to his birth  and
killing  him  then  -  or (much better) by turning them  into  an  agent  for
themselves). So be careful who you allow this spell to have.

Enables  the caster to see past events that occurred in the area  where  they
are when the spell is cast. The caster selects the time that is to be viewed,
which  may be from 2 up to (level-1) years ago. Only one time may be selected
per  casting. The caster may rotate his sight 360 , but cannot move from  his
starting position. The caster's sight is limited by the same conditions  that
would  limit  them  if they were physically present (walls,  darkness,  rain,
etc.).  The  caster cannot bring a light with him but a spell that  gave  him
infravision  would  allow  him to see in the dark.  Wards  that  would  block
scrying  also block time sight. This spell requires an hour glass  that  runs
for  10 minutes. The caster must be stationary throughout the duration of the
spell.

This  spell takes a spherical area, and everything in it, forward or backward
in time. The spell will move the caster as well, if he is within the sphere.
The  spell  will  only move those affected through time, not  through  space.
Therefore,  a group of individuals will be moved to the same spot in  another
time.  Note that this may cause problems for the recipients if those affected
are  moved  to  a  time  where a certain spot was, for example,  an  erupting
volcano.
The  spell will move those affected either forward in time up to 10 years per
level  of  the  caster, or backward in time up to 100 years per  level.  When
casting  the  spell, the wizard will designate the number of  years  that  he
wishes  to  move those involved; but month, day, and hour are to be  randomly
determined within that year.
Note  that  if  the caster uses this spell offensively against opponents,  by
moving  those  affected in time to get rid of them, they are not  entitled  a
saving throw and magic resistance seldom affects 10th-level spells.
Also,  anyone or anything that is only partially within the sphere of  effect
will  not  be  transported to another time. Instead they  will  be  violently
thrown from the sphere causing possible damage.
This  spell  can  also  be used to destroy time elementals.  The  spell  will
permanently disrupt them, without any kind of saving throw.
In addition, those that are transported, willingly or not, will automatically
lose one point of Constitution, permanently. Therefore, it is not a good idea
to  make  various  "merchant"  runs  back  in  time,  where  certain  current
technologies might fetch a high profit.
Lastly, it is up to the DM's philosophy on time travel as to whether  or  not
changing the events in the past will alter the future. In other words, the DM
must  decide the outcome of the "If I go back and kill my grandfather, before
he  fathered  my father, will I cease to exist" dilemma. It may be  the  DM's
opinion  that  the person who kills his grandfather will cease to  exist,  or
possibly  it  may  be that a person attempting to kill his ancestor  will  be
prevented from doing so by other circumstances. Again, the decision is up  to
the DM; just be ready for any character's experimentation.

The  material components for the spell include a sanctified holy symbol  from
the  head druidic god, an empty hourglass made from glass and mithril  (value
500 gp), and a pinch of the essence of a slain time elemental.

Timejump  allows the teleport ahead in time by roughly 60 seconds.  When  the
spell  is cast, the wizard disappears for 1 round, and then reappears in  the
same  place. For the wizard, the shift in time is instantaneous, so he cannot
prepare  for "re-entry" in any way. The wizard reappears at the same time  in
the  round that he disappeared (using initiative as a clock), and cannot take
any actions during the round of "re-entry". If a solid object is blocking the
spot  where  the wizard will reappear, then he will be trapped in the  astral
plane. Getting home is up to the wizard.

This  spell  is  similar to a haste spell, but instead  of  speeding  up  the
recipients' metabolic reactions, timespeed alters the flow of time around the
recipients.  As a result, for every minute that passes in the real  world,  2
minutes pass for those affected. Because time itself is being changed,  those
affected  by  this spell do not age. On the down side, all  spells  or  spell
effects  cast on the recipients of a Timespeed only last half as long  (going
by  "real world" time), regardless of whether or not they were cast before or
during the Timespeed. The maintenance cost of psionic powers that affect only
the  psionicist is doubled as well. Wizards cast spells as if they were under
the influence of an alacrity spell (see the Tome of Magic).

The  material components are two clock faces painted on slate,  one  an  hour
ahead of the other. These are consumed during the casting.

With tomelore, the wizard knows whether a text is cursed, what language it is
in,  its  author,  and other general information about its contents.  Nothing
specific about its safeguards, contents, or history will be revealed, though.
The material component is a lens, and is not consumed in the casting.
The  reverse of this spell, tomelie, makes all of the above information  seem
to  be other than it is when determined using divinatory spells. It lasts for
one  month unless dispelled. The material component or the reverse is a  drop
of black ink.

Tomewipe can be a very powerful spell and is similar to spells that  erase  a
wizard's memory, but it instead erases all magical language from a scroll  or
tome.  1d8+1 pages per level can be erased in this manner. This spell has  no
effect  if  any magical wards are in place to protect the tome and  gives  no
indication  of  any such wards: the spell simply fizzles out  in  the  normal
fashion of failed magic. If tome, scroll, or whatever the magic is written on
fails a saving throw versus spell, the normal effect takes place. The reverse
of  this spell, tomerestore, is the only way the magic can be returned to the
tome. This suggests that even though dispel magic would have no effect  on  a
book or blank piece of paper that magic has already acted upon, the magic  is
still there or has been made invisible somehow. What actually happens to  the
words  in the tome is probably something like this: the words are transformed
into  magical  energy  and stored on another plane, dimension,  or  similarly
other world.
The  material components of this spell are a flaming staff of at least 2 feet
length  and  50  gp value, that must be waved over the tome or scroll  during
casting, and an ornate sphere of any light coloured material of at least  150
gp  in  value  and  able to withstand shock considerably well.  The  material
component  of the reverse is either the original sphere (which may  be  where
the magic is stored, but no way to transfer it has yet been found) which must
be  shattered  or  cracked in half or a handful of rare herbs  that  must  be
burned as incense in the same airspace as the original tome. This action also
releases the magic from its holding area if the sphere was lost or destroyed.
This  second method is quite unreliable and has only a 60% chance of success,
plus 5% per caster level over the spell level.

This  spell causes a spellcasting creature to temporarily lose the  knowledge
of  how  to  cast  any spells unless a saving throw is made. Those  fortunate
enough to have made their saving throw must make an Intelligence check before
casting  each spell throughout the Attack's duration. Even those spells  that
the  recipient does manage to cast are made as if they were cast by a  wizard
two  levels  lower  with respect to spell effects. If  the  saving  throw  is
failed, the material components are still expended.

When this spell is cast on an enemy wizard, it will cause the target's tongue
to  twitch  violently, thus disrupting any spell being cast  at  the  moment,
unless the victim makes a successful saving throw versus spell. The level  of
the  spell  being cast by the target determines the modifier applied  to  the
saving throw as follows: saving throw modifier = spell level - 5 (i.e., a 2nd-
level spell inflicts a -3 to the saving throw, a 7th-level spell earns  a  +2
to the saving throw, etc.).
The victim must be in the process of casting a spell with a verbal component.
If  no spell is currently being cast by the target, the tonguetwister has  no
effect.  If  the opponent's spell goes into effect at the same  time  as  the
tonguetwister, the victim earns an additional +2 bonus to the  saving  throw.
This spell cannot affect a spell that has already been cast, nor one that  is
to be cast in the future.

The  material  component of this spell is a tongue of any creature;  this  is
consumed when the spell is cast.

     A psionicist with this power can "see" objects by passing his
hand on them, much like a blind man would do. He gains an accurate
mental  image of everything he touches. The image will  show  only
details  which can be acquired by touch, so color wilnot be  seen,
for example.

Power  Score:   The power is so sensitive that the psionicist  can
detect  the  difference  of  ink from paper,  and  colors  can  be
discerned by their warmth (although not very accurately).

20:   The  psionicist loses all sensation in  his  hand  for  2d10
rounds. This gives a -1 penalty to attack rolls with this hand.

This  divination  is  cast on the ash remains of a particular  defiler.  When
completed,  the  caster  may  get an image of the  defiler  and  his  general
direction and distance. If the caster is 13th-level or higher, he could  also
learn the name of the defiler (his common name or nickname).
The  ash  must be mixed with water, two flasks per level of the defiler.  The
caster could very well not know his level. If the water is insufficient,  the
spell  fails  and  the ash and water disappear. The ash from that  particular
spot  cannot  be  used again to trace the same defiler,  regardless  of  what
remains of it.
The base chance of success is 30%. This is modified as follows:

     +5%  per level of the caster.
      2%  per level of the defiler.
     +2%  per level of the defiling spell.
     +30% if the caster has already seen the defiler.
     +5%  per flask of water over the required quantity.
      20% per day separating this divination and the defiling casting.

This spell was designed for the Dark Sun campaign world.

This spell reveals crucial events in one sentient being's life to the caster.
The  caster must be intimately familiar with the subject's history as  it  is
commonly  known, or at least casually acquainted with the subject personally.
However,  "crucial"  need  not  even be part  of  recorded  history  or  even
presented accurately in said history. The event is replayed instantly in  the
mind's eye of the caster. A timeline can be traced back 1d10 years per  skill
level of the caster. The use of this spell has a 5% chance of attracting  the
attention of time guardians.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for
more information on this class.

This  spell  gives  the  caster the ability to  follow  the  trail  of  other
creatures across most types of terrain. The base chance of success is 5%  per
point of Wisdom. This is further cumulatively modified as shown below.
The  material components are a forked twig and a metal coin. The twig is  not
expended in the casting and its value can affect the chance of success.

Soft or muddy ground     +20%
Thick brush, vines or reeds   +15%
Occasional signs of passage, dust  +10%
Normal ground, wood floor     0%
Rocky ground or shallow water  50%
Every two creatures in the group   +5%
Every 12 hours since trail was made      5%
Every hour of rain, snow or sleet   25%
Poor lighting (moon, starlight...)  30%
Tracked party attempts to hide trail     25%
Experience of the caster +3% per level
Value of metal twig +1% per gold piece of value

The  spell  can  be  cast by more than one priest. In that  case,  every  one
contributes a +5% bonus to the central caster (the tracker). This  spell  was
designed for the Dark Sun campaign world. Any monetary units are for the Dark
Sun, increase where appropriate.

This spell allows the priest to place an enchantment on an object. The priest
will then know, for the duration, the direction and relative distance to  the
object. The object can be up to a mile away before the spell fades away.  The
spell  will last until the spell duration expires or it is dispelled. If  the
object  is  on a unknowing recipient at the time of casting, then  (and  only
then) does the carrier get a saving throw.

With  this  spell,  the casting priest is temporarily endowed  with  tracking
ability  similar to that of a ranger. However, the tracking spell is  better.
Using  this spell, the priest becomes not only aware of all physical  traces,
but  psychic  traces too. Thus, he could trace a creature who  has  travelled
using  pass without trace. This makes almost anything trackable, even  aerial
creatures  (at  least,  those who leave strong enough  psychic  impressions).
There  are  some  restrictions, though. The priest must  have  an  item  that
belonged to the creature being tracked. Furthermore, tracking with this spell
must  begin  at  a point that the creature has been at within the  past  half
hour. The material component for the spell is some mistletoe.

This  spell can be used to enchant a weapon. This weapon must be used  within
one  day after the casting. The caster must kill a victim with not more  than
one  blow  from this blade, where upon the enchantment of the  spell  on  the
blade will suck the life into the blade. The weapon may then be plunged  into
the  breast  of a dead creature to restore life to that one. A maximum  of  5
levels  or  Hit Dice will be transferred from the victim to the  beneficiary.
The  victim's dead body then either rots away (when he still would  have  had
one  or more levels left), or explodes. The material component of this  spell
is a dagger of at least +3 enchantment.

The priest goes into a meditative trance, and, after being in this trance for
one  round, can feel the presence of the spirits in the area   including  the
spirits of the animals in the area.
For  example: if, say, a troll happened to be within 100 yards of the priest,
the priest would certainly know that something large and fell is in the area,
but,  unless  the  priest had come into contact with the spirit  of  a  troll
before, wouldn't know what it was.

This  spell  converts sound waves from a song currently being  played  within
hearing range of the bard to musical notation onto a piece of paper the  bard
has in his possession. It will transcribe up to one round worth of music into
the musical notation most familiar to the bard.
This  spell is useful for keeping records of new songs, or for keeping  track
of  songs  the  bard is worried about forgetting. It does not work  well  for
conversations,  since it does not transcribe the words  of  songs,  only  the
noted of the song itself.

The material components for this spell are a piece of paper or parchment, two
ounces of good ink, and a grain of diamond dust.

This spell allows a caster of higher level to subvert previous magical charms
to  his  own  purposes. An example: Erin, a second level wizard  casts  charm
person  on  a  Bryce, who becomes charmed. Anna, a third level  wizard  casts
transfer  charm onto Bryce, whereupon Bryce becomes charmed to Anna. Deneira,
another  third level wizard, can now no longer transfer the charm to herself,
as she is of the same level as Anna.

This  spell alleviates the undesired effect of being unable to use one's  own
magic  items  after changing one's shape by polymorph, (druidic) shapechange,
etc.  This  spell makes all those items available for use to the  transformed
creature even if the items are incorporated into the body - but be logical in
what  you  intend to do (say, for example you shapechanged into a flea,  then
you obviously could not use your quarterstaff, +3 to any effect (as it is too
small) but the ring of protection, +3 and the ring of fire resistance you are
now  wearing  somewhere  in your body still function normally).  Items  which
release  magical  energy can still be used normally unless they  require  the
item  to  be  touched to a target other than the releaser (you couldn't,  for
example, use your potion of healing on a friend while being in flea form  but
you  could use it on yourself - with normal initiative modifiers). Obviously,
it  would  not be possible to use a long bow while being transformed  (unless
you  had shapechanged into a creature which could use a longbow so you  would
probably  also  have no need of this spell then). Spell-like effects  somehow
leave  the  body of the transformed creature (maybe giving rise to  some  new
legendary  monster stories like the horribly mutated lightning bolt spitting,
regenerating killer flea) if they have a range greater than touch,  personal,
or  zero.  If  the  creature  is  killed,  all  items  have  to  save  versus
disintegration or be destroyed by the residual magic.

The  material components are one small figure per item incorporated into  the
body, carved from granite picturing the original creature. These figures then
have  to be stoneshaped into a form which creates an interconnecting form  in
which  all  the figures are somehow linked with each other. Thus, it  is  not
possible  to pick up additional items unless the caster has provided  surplus
figures  in  the  casting. Up to a maximum of one  item  per  figure  can  be
incorporated.

This  spell allows a caster the possibility to cast spells while being  in  a
transformed  state. The spell provides one spell level per two caster  levels
with  which to cast spells from the transformed state. The spell lasts  until
all  spell  levels are used up. It is possible to stack this spell  up  to  2
spell levels per caster level. The requirements to be able to cast spells are
simple:  the  components  of  the  spells which  are  to  be  cast  from  the
transformed  state are still required. That means that the transformed  shape
still requires vocal and somatic capabilities, if these components are in the
spells  to be cast. The components don't have to be done in the usual manner;
the spell provides the necessary changes. Thus, a wizard might polymorph into
a  bluebird (incorporating his bag of material components into the body), fly
across the opponents camp (moving his wings a lot) and chirping a lovely song
(actually  saying the vocal component) and suddenly drop a fireball.  A  flea
might  not  be such a good shape as it lacks both the verbal and the  somatic
requirements,  but if they can be provided for, well... you  might  get  some
really dangerous fleas hopping around in the future.

The  material  component is a tiny but very life-like statue  of  the  caster
(rendered  from  a single diamond) which has to have a fully moveable  mouth,
fully flexible hands and fingers, and an openable bag on its belt. Into  this
bag  have  to be filled one drop of fresh blood from the caster. This  statue
has to cost no less than 5000 gp per maximum possible spell level.

This  spell allows a caster to cast spells even if in a transformed state  of
the  body.  Thus, it would be possible for a druid in animal  shape  to  cast
spells; the same goes for a priest with merge with stone in effect, etc. This
spell  offers  the priest the possibility to cast up to one spell  level  per
caster  level in the transformed state. The cast spells still require all  of
their components, but this spell provides the necessary changes. The form the
priest  is  in  still needs to have vocal and somatic capabilities,  and  the
material  components  of  the  spells  have  to  be  incorporated  into   the
transformed  body somewhere. If all of these are given, then the  priest  may
cast  his  spells from the transformed state. Thus, a bird might fly chirping
across the sky (being a druid) casting a wall of thorns on his opponents,  or
a  bland  wall  (which  has  to be thick enough  for  the  priest  inside  to
gesticulate)  might suddenly sprout a blade barrier, etc. It is  possible  to
stack this spell up to three spell levels per caster level.
The  material components are the holy symbol of the priest plus a  small  but
most life-like statue of him with a most detailed rendition of moveable mouth
and  hands, wearing a bulging bag on his belt. This statue has to  be  carved
from  the  most holy substance known to the religion. It has to  be  embalmed
with  rare  oils for 1d6+1 months. All this costs no less than  1000  gp  per
level of the caster.

The  invention  of the crafty shadow-wizard, this spell is a  very  effective
immobilization technique. It can affect the full garments of up to 5 small, 3
medium,  or  1  large sized being per three levels of the  caster.  Enchanted
clothing has a 20% chance per enchantment or plus to resist the spell.  Cloth
that  has  been transformed into iron is not simply woven iron - the  strands
are  partially fused so as to be solid. A successful Bend Bars roll  may,  at
the  DM's option, depending on the amount of clothing being dealt with, allow
one to free oneself (ruining the garments irrevocably). The transformation is
permanent unless the reverse of the spell, transmute iron to cloth, is  cast.
The  reverse is also quite effective in neutralizing attacks, but it does  so
by  causing  metal armour and weapons to become ineffective  cloth  replicas.
Cloth  swords  will become limp and floppy, cloth plate will hang  in  folds.
This is far from immobilizing, but tends to ruin Armour Class. It affects the
metal  gear of 5 small, 3 medium, or 1 large sized being per three levels  of
the  caster.  Enchanted metal objects, or objects made primarily of  mithril,
silver, or other precious metals are not affected at all. When reversing this
effect,  take  care that the objects in question are held in  their  original
shape - a floppy sword that is simply reconverted while flopping will be very
oddly  shaped  and  not  very  useful. Multiple reconversions  may  fix  such
problems.  The spell does not affect iron-based or cloth-based monsters  (if,
indeed,  the latter exist), including golems. The material component of  both
this spell and its reverse is a needle.

This  spell turns any non-organic object into alcohol. The object must be  at
least  10 yards away and in sight. It will turn into the most common form  of
alcohol  that  is in the player's campaign world. Thus if beer  is  the  most
prevalent form of alcohol, the object turns to beer.
Objects  can be turned back with the reverse of this spell, transmute alcohol
to matter, but all liquid must be contained together.
After  chanting  and  using motions involving thinking and  pointing  at  the
object  to  be turned, the caster throws the material components (a  drop  of
100% alcohol in a crystal casing and a very simple, small, wooden carving  of
the object) at the object, which always magically hits the object. Any object
that is turned can be drunk, and once inside turned back.
The  reverse,  when used on normal alcohol, can summon very strange  objects.
The  DM  can decide on what object, or roll on the Magical Item Table in  the
Net  Alcohol Guide to see what it is (if this is used then it only looks like
the magical item rolled).

This  spell  allows  a  priest  to show his dedication  to  his  deity.  When
successfully  cast, this spell turns any palatable water  into  wine  of  the
highest quality of the priest's choice. Salt water or contamined water gets a
saving throw. Detect magic spells may (50% chance) show it to have a very dim
glow.
Only  a  truly dedicated priest is allowed to cast this spell, and  frivolous
castings may incur the wrath of superior beings. Proper conditions to be  met
are:
          the priest's deity will be honoured by this act;
           the  casting  is used to help recruit influential persons  to  the
deity's cause;
           more  worshippers or believers may be drawn to the  deity  through
this act (the more, the better!); and
           certain ceremonies may use this to celebrate the divinity  of  the
deity.
The material component for this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

This  power will make any object transparent, but still with  it's
strength properties and other physical properties.  It is  similar
to  making the object invisible.  This can be used to peer through
a  wall without exposing oneself to dangers that may exist on  the

This  spell  prevents travel by extraplanar means, distorting the effects  of
spells like blink and teleport. Any time a spell involving such transport  is
cast  and the victim is involved (either as wizard or passenger), there is  a
5%  chance  per level of the caster of travel cancellation that the transport
spell will misfire. The spell lasts for a maximum of 1 turn per level, or for
one  third  the caster's level (rounded down) cancellations, whichever  comes
first.
Misfires:
           Rope  trick:  the  victim is unable to enter the  extradimensional
space.
           Blink:  the victim always reappears in the same spot,  but  facing
away from enemies.
           Dimension door: the distance travelled is constant, but  direction
is random.
           Dimension  folding:  the  fold closes  in  front  of  the  victim,
preventing transit.
           Bowgentle's fleeting journey: the wizard is teleported instead  of
the passenger.
           Teleport: either fails, or arrive 1d10 miles from destination  (DM
choice).
          Teleport dead: the wizard is teleported instead of the body.
          Plane shift: the group lands in a random area in the prime material
plane.
Succour (both versions), teleport without error, astral spell, and any spells
over  sixth  level  are unaffected. It is the DM's option if extradimensional
magic  items  (bag  of holding, well of many worlds, etc.)  are  affected  by
travel  cancellation.  The  material components  are  two  magnets  that  are
strongly  attracted  to  one another, one of which  has  the  wizard's  sigil
painted on it.

The  creature  affected by this dweomer will find that their  movements  have
become  utterly  silent. So long as the creature does not exceed  its  normal
base  movement rate for the environment it is in (i.e., measured in  tens  of
feet  indoors  and tens of yards outdoors), then it will make no  perceptible
sound  as  it moves about, regardless of the mode of transport be it  flight,
swimming,  climbing, walking, etc. If the subject of the spell is willing  to
take  no  other  actions  besides movement in a given round,  then  inanimate
objects  may  be  handled  silently as well, meaning  that  a  sword  may  be
unsheathed  without being heard, or a door opened that is not jammed  in  its
frame.  Any object that requires great force to move or open will  not  allow
for this silent action.
Environmental factors will not normally affect the subject's ability to  move
silently, and thus squeaky doors, floors, water, and mud offer no resistance:
squeaky  doors  will  not squeak when opened by the  subject  of  the  spell,
squeaky  floors  will  not give enough to creak under  the  subject's  weight
(although  unsound flooring will, of course, not remain silent if  the  floor
cannot support the subject at all and breaks out from underneath him),  water
will not splash with the subject's passing, and mud will not slosh. Traps  or
other items which react in a noisy manner by snapping shut violently or  trip
wires  strung  with bells must be avoided normally as they  will  hinder  the
subject's passage and make noise as usual.
Any  sudden  action  on the subject's part will make the expected  amount  of
noise, but cautious, slow actions will make no sound at all. This spell  does
not actually mask sounds that the subject intends on making, and thus speech,
spell  casting, and forcefully opened doors will all be heard  normally.  The
subject  of  this  spell may, of course, alternate between making  noise  and
moving unheard for the spell's duration.
Note  that  this spell is not an illusion, and actually alters the amount  of
sound a creature makes when interacting with its environment.

The material component for this spell is a bit of zombie flesh.

      By  use  of  this spell, the wizard can control a tree branch  for  the
duration  of  the spell. The wizard can make the branch wave, attack,  fan  a
small breeze, etc. If the branch attacks, it does so as a fighter of the same
level as the wizard and inflicts 2d6 points of damage. This spell works  only
on full size trees.

target, which can be a person, building, ..., whatever. This plant will  feed
on  the life force of the target creature, or, if cast on something that  has
none, on any other energy it can find and use.
If  the  target  is a building, then the plant will simply grow  in,  on,  or
around it, possibly causing structural damage, as specified by the priest. It
takes seven hours for the plant to grow to full size, so this spell will  not
work  as  an  instant ladder. It can, on the other hand, be used to  hide  an
entrance or make a treasure cache quite undetectable.
If  the  target  is  a creature with life force or other energy  (undead  and
golems are not immune, for example), the plant will feed on the life force of
the  target  creature,  draining one level of energy each  round,  until  the
target drops to  1 HD, and dies. Ability scores fall proportionately as  fast
as  the Hit Dice. So, a 9th-level character with Strength 18 and Intelligence
9  would lose 2 points of Strength, 1 HD, and 1 point of Intelligence,  among
other  things,  for  nine  rounds, and then die. The  corpse  of  the  target
creature  will  then  turn into parts of the plant. To reverse  the  process,
raise   dead  or  similar  spells  do  not  work.  Additionally,  having   an
Intelligence  score of zero makes speak with dead impossible.  On  the  other
hand,  such  a  victim can still reincarnate, and speak with plants  is  also
possible, as the mind remains within the plant.
This  is  a  spell  that is very seldom used by druids because  of  its  long
casting time and obvious evilness. It is normally used on old druids who feel
that  their  life  is at an end and wish to live on in the  grove,  or  as  a
partial retribution on those who destroy plant life needlessly or violate any
dryad, supposing either is within the protection of a druid.
The  material component of this spell is a seedling of the plant to  grow  on
the target, which must have been softened in holy water for at least a day.

      The wizard creates a number of various minor illusions such as coloured
sparkles,  puffs  of  smoke, or small floating objects equal  to  his  level.
Creatures  of low intelligence and semi-intelligence (Intelligence scores  of
2-7) must save versus spell or become involuntarily fascinated for 1d6 rounds
or  until attacked (whichever comes first). Even creatures of higher or lower
Intelligence  may  become distracted. Tricks is most commonly  used  for  the
purpose  of  entertaining  an  audience. The  material  components  are  some
pebbles.

Actually, this is a low-budget entangle. However, the effectiveness  of  this
spell  depends  upon the amount of underbrush in the area  of  effect.  In  a
bramble  of  thorn-bushes, it is as effective as  an  entangle  spell.  On  a
putting green, it has no effect at all. The material component of this  spell
is a small twig with thorns on it.

This  spell summons a number of fierce trolls to fight for the wizard in  the
manner  of the other call spells. The wizard can summon either normal  trolls
(7  HD cost) or, at sixteenth level, two-headed trolls. The wizard can summon
1«  HD  per level, with all remainders being dropped. Only one type of  troll
can  be  summoned.  Other  types of trolls could be  summoned,  at  the  DM's
discretion.

This  spell  creates an illusion of a window in a wall near the subject.  The
subject must save versus spell or be seized by an irresistible compulsion  to
leap through the supposed window, hitting his head on the wall and taking 1d4
points of damage per level of the wizard and being stunned for one round. Non-
intelligent creatures are immune to this spell, and creatures immune to blunt
weapons,  or unable to perform leaping actions, take no damage. The  material
component is a small pane of glass, which is consumed in casting.
This  spell was researched by the gnomish illusionist/thief Trosli Kenderkin,
a  notorious trickster who once took out five gnolls (at first level) with  a
bag of marbles and a dagger.

This  spell creates a bright aura three inches thick that covers the caster's
entire body. The aura has these effects:
          immunity to light- and energy-battacks;
          a total protection from physical attacks by creatures of the quasi-
elemental planes of radiance, lighting, and minerals;
           the  ability to breathe and move at full movement rate within  the
quasi-elemental plane of radiance;
          the ability to cast altar of protection once.
The  aura does not restrict the caster in any way. He is free to move and act
normally while under the influence of this spell.

This spell creates a specific emotion or emotional state in the creature. All
the  emotions  are  available (hate, love, fear, etc.). The  emotion  can  be
directed  (for  example, Joe the drow falls in love with Alisa the  paladin).
Unlike  a similar effect available from a wish, the emotion is true  and  not
subject  to  "healing", or dispelling. But, since the emotion  is  real,  the
affected  creature might be able to ignore the emotion (just  like  any  real
emotion).  The  creature affected must be at least 8 levels  lower  than  the
caster.
This  spell takes away 1d6 points of Charisma from the caster for  1d4  days.
Demigods and gods are immune to this penalty.

This  spell is similar to the 2nd-level zone of truth, but true speak is much
more  powerful.  True  speak is used to force creatures to  answer  questions
truthfully. To complete the spell, the priest presents his holy symbol  in  a
forceful manner and demands the answers to various questions. The priest then
touches  the creature he wishes to question with his holy symbol. Ensorcelled
creatures  are then compelled to answer the questions truthfully and  to  the
best  of their ability. Although information need not be volunteered, nothing
relevant may be omitted in answering a direct question.
Characters of greater Hit Dice or levels than the priest are allowed a saving
throw  versus  spell. Creatures making the saving throw  are  not  forced  to
answer questions, however, everything they do say must be the truth. In  this
instance,  true  speak functions exactly like the zone of  truth  spell,  and
affected  creatures  are allowed to evade questions, answer  indirectly,  and
refuse to answer so long as everything they do say is completely true.
In many areas, admissions made under the effects of true speak are admissible
in courts of law. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy
symbol and a true emerald, ruby, or diamond.

This  spell  causes the affected creatures to hiccup uncontrollably  for  the

still  be affected, and leaving the area will not stop the hiccups until  the

      With this cantrip, the bard can bring one note of an instrument in tune
with  either a hummed note, the equivalent note played by a second instrument
(in which case the component of the spell is that other instrument, which  is
obviously  not  consumed in the casting; what good would that  do?),  or  the
result  of  a  preceding  pitch cantrip (q.v.). The  one  note  will  end  up
perfectly in tune with the reference note. As many instruments as are in  the
area of effect can be brought into tune at once.

     A well-tuned instrument (with two or more tuned notes) has the effect of
making  the  bard's  songs more melodious and enjoyable; this  has  the  game
effects of reducing the saving throws of hostile creatures versus the  bard's
mood-altering  story  telling  by 1, as well as  making  the  bard's  morale-
boosting  song affect the listeners for an additional 50% longer (i.e.,  one-
and-a-half rounds per level) than it usually does.

      Too  many notes perfectly tuned on an instrument, however, will have  a
negative  effect on other bards in the area, who will realise that the  tuned
instrument  has  been magically tampered with to sound so perfect.  For  each
note  above  one  that  the  instrument has  been  tuned,  the  hostile  bard
personally  gets  a  +1  to  his  saving  throw  versus  the  playing  bard's
influencing reactions effects.

      Although  the tuning is instantaneous, the effects of the cantrip  last
for  a  while.  In perfect conditions (humidity on the low side,  comfortable
temperature, no rough handling), the instrument will stay tuned for  a  week.
In less than perfect conditions (typical adventuring abuse, for example), the
instrument  will  have to be re-tuned every day. If the instrument  is  taken
apart for storage, such as flutes or other woodwinds are, the instrument will
have to be re-tuned every time it is reassembled.

The  reverse  of  this  cantrip, untune, causes one  note  of  the  specified
instrument  to  become horribly out of tune. It also has the side  effect  of
turning the wizard's hands a brilliant red for one turn after the cantrip  is
cast, unfortunately.

This  spell turns back the clock of time for the entire current plane of  the
caster,  by an amount of at most one year per level of the caster. The  years
are relived for the years set back. Only extraplanar creatures and the caster
are  aware that the clock was moved back. There is no known way to undo  this
spell.
A  mortal  caster is never granted such a spell. A demigod caster  ceases  to
exist,  permanently. Full deities must roll 1d20; on a 19 or  20,  the  deity
ceases to exist. Else, the deity permanently loses 20 points of Constitution.

      By  means of this spell, a necromancer (and no other wizard)  can  turn
undead  as a priest of equal level. If the caster uses holy or unholy  water,
the  undead are not allowed saving throws, otherwise the turned creatures are
allowed saving throws versus spell to resist the urge to turn. Disintegration
is  also possible, but an evil wizard cannot gain control over the undead  as
an evil priest could: this spell always turns.

This  spell allows a non-evil wizard to turn undead in the same fashion as  a
priest.  The spell only turns undead, it does not allow the wizard to command
undead  as some evil priest can do. If the wizard is of good alignment,  then
turning  is  done at the wizard's level minus six. If the wizard  is  neither
good nor evil, then the turning is done at his level minus ten. This spell is
of  no  use  to evil wizards. In all other aspects, the spell operates  as  a
normal  turning attempt, with the wizard required to roll 1d20 to see if  the
attempt is successful.

A priest can call upon his god to shield him from the eyes of others. His God
then averts the eyes of those around the caster, so that the caster will  not
be  noticed. Creatures with the lowest Hit Dice or levels are affected first.
So,  if  a  8th-level  priest casts this spell and he faces  three  1st-level
fighters,  one 2nd-level and one 5th-level, only the 5th-level doesn't  avert
his  eyes, the others do (they can be distracted by a sound or something,  or
just  happen  to look the other way). Note that the 5th-level fighter's  eyes
are not averted by the spell, but that doesn't mean he automatically sees the
caster.  It just means he's not affected by the spell. The spell effect  also
wears off if the caster makes a lot of noise (more than talking-level),  such
as  melee  combat. Casting other spells does not end the spell. The  material
component of this spell is a hood, to be donned by the caster.

This  spell  is a more powerful version of the 1st-level find familiar.  When
the  spell  is cast, five animals will be summoned to the caster. The  caster
chooses  whichever animal he wants as his familiar. The familiar will usually
be  stronger  than  others of its kind (roll normal Hit Dice,  rerolling  any
rolls  of  1,  2, or 3). In addition, the animal will be smarter than  normal
animals (roll 2d4 for Intelligence, adding on normal creature Intelligence to
the  result). It is possible to gain pseudo-dragons or other exotic creatures
as familiars with this spell. In all other ways, this spell is similar to the
find familiar spell, except that along with the herbs that must be burnt,  an
offering must be made - if raw meat is offered, for instance, then you  could
get  a wolf, a coyote, a hawk, a badger, and a bobcat to arrive, all of  whom
make  savings  throws versus death magic. If they save, then they  will  just
flee,  and  the  caster must make his choice from those animals  that  remain
behind. The caster can refuse all of the animals, but must wait for at  least
a year before casting this spell again.

Twilight's  dark hand of magic is a vastly more powerful form of  the  spells
charm  person and domination. Unlike the former spells, Elves and  Half-Elves
don't  have any more resistance against the dark hand than anyone else.  Like
domination,  the caster can control the person affected. Unlike any  previous
charm,  the  affected person can still cast spells, but only when the  caster
tells him to do so.
With  the saving throw, the victim gets an initial saving throw versus  death
magic,  modified  as below. He also gains another saving throw  whenever  the
controlling  spellcaster demands an action which would probably lead  to  the
death  of the victim, or to someone dearly loved by the victim. Modifications
are as follows:
Add  the  level, Intelligence, and Wisdom of both caster and victim together.
Compare the two. If, after all modifications, the caster's total is equal  to
or lower than that of the victim, then the victim gains a bonus to his saving
throw. Otherwise, the victim has a penalty.

     Total     Saving throw
     difference     bonus or penalty
     up to -9  +4
     -8 to -6  +3
     -5 to -3  +2
     -2 to 0   +1
     +1 to +3  +0
     +4 to +7  -1
     +8 to +11 -2
     +12 or more    -3

The victim also gains a Wisdom bonus, offset by the Wisdom bonus possessed by
the  caster - thus, if the caster has an 18 Wisdom and the victim  has  a  12
Wisdom,  then  that  is  a penalty of -4 to the saving  throw,  reflecting  a
struggle of wills.
This  spell can be made permanent, without any threat of loss to the caster's
Constitution. The material component of this spell is a dark crystal.

      Twilight's  gag  is a specialized spell, similar to  the  priest  spell
silence,  15-foot radius. Twilight's gag, however, affects only one creature.
The  creature  is unable to make any sounds, although items  around  him  can
still  be  heard.  Twilight's gag also blocks out any sound  to  the  victim,
protecting him from sound-based attacks. For every four levels the caster  is
at,  the victim receives a -1 penalty to his saving throw (so a victim  of  a
17th-level gag would save at -4). The component for this spell is a length of
cotton cloth, in the form of a gag.

This  spell  is similar to Twilight's darkness bubble. Instead  of  darkness,
however, a field of invisibility, similar to the spell invisibility, 10  feet
radius,  is  created. Unlike the former spell, on the inside  of  the  field,
creatures can see each other, and can see outside of the sphere as  well.  In
addition,  any  attack  coming  from a creature  inside  of  the  field  will
automatically  negate the entire field, even if the attack  fails.  Once  the
spell is cast, those entering the invisible field will not turn invisible  or
be  able  to see those who are. If someone wanders beyond the 40-foot  radius
around  the  focal point of the spell, he will become visible.  The  material
component of the spell is a thin piece of clear quartz crystal.

This  spell will allow a silk rope of good condition to temporarily duplicate
the  characteristics of a rope of climbing. In addition, the  rope  can  even
float  vertically across open air and attach itself to an object, for example
on the other side of a chasm. One turn after the spell is completed, the rope
will  burst  into flames and consume itself. The rope itself is the  material

This  spell  causes  a creature to appear. This creature is  physical,  looks
exactly  like  the  wizard, but has no personality: it  is  actually  only  a
channel through which the wizard can operate. The twin has only a fraction of
the hit points of the wizard:

     D6 Roll   Hit Points
     1 or 2    40% of wizard
     3 or 4    50% of wizard
     5 or 6    60% of wizard

This  spell  does not create possessions for this creature. The  wizard  will
wholly operate through this twin and therefore will need items for this twin.
While the spell is in effect the wizard's body is effectively unconscious. If
the  wizard specifically concentrates he can partially sense the area  around
the  real  body.  If  the  twin is destroyed the  wizard  and  any  familiars
automatically will lose half their hit points. Furthermore the wizard will be
unable to cast spells for 1d6 days.

The material component for this spell is a mirror.

With this spell, the caster creates a number of magical knife-like blades  of
energy,  which speed from the casters hand at the target, as if thrown  by  a
fighter  of  a  level  equal to the level of the caster,  with  the  caster's
Dexterity  bonus applicable. The missiles cannot affect astral, ethereal,  or
out  of  phase  targets, nor does it affect non-corporeal targets.  Invisible
targets can be struck, however, if their location is known to the caster. The
caster  can  create two missiles plus one additional missile  for  every  two
levels  above  third  that the caster has obtained,  to  a  maximum  of  five
missiles at ninth level or higher. Each missile that successfully strikes its
target inflicts 1d6 HP of damage. Attack rolls must be made for each missile,
and more then one creature may be targeted.
In  addition, at the caster's option, one missile may be forfeited to gain  a
+2  bonus  to hit and damage with all other missiles created. This  does  not
enable  the caster to strike the above noted creatures, however. The material
component  is a finely crafted miniature dagger of at least 500 gp  in  value
which is not consumed by the casting.

This spell conjures into being a rumpled flowing mass of silken cloth with  a
two  handed sword wielded by some unseen entity inside the cloth. The  fabric
fighter  has one Hit Die per 3 caster levels, it attacks 2 times for standard
two-hander damage. It cannot be disarmed and moves at a rate of 12, 8  flying
(class  B).  Its  Armour  Class is 2, and due to its  flowing  and  malleable
nature, piercing and clubbing weapons do no damage.

The  material  components for this spell are a silk cloth and  a  tiny  metal
sword, which are consumed in the casting.

This  spell requires the death shroud or clothing of a historically important
person  of any type (wise man, king, loved nun) and a handful of grave  dirt.
It  conjures  into  being a mindless undead with hit points  equal  to  three
quarters of those of the caster's. Its touch drains one level and it radiates
a fear aura which must be saved against at -2, or the victims are affected by
fear as if the caster had cast it upon them. The phantom is AC 0.

This  spell requires bloodhawk feathers and a silk handkerchief, and  as  the
magical  word  Sar-Anwrap is spoken, the wad of components is hurled  through
the air. In flight, they change into a glowing white sheet which will wrap up
the  target  for one round per wizard level, or half that time if they  save.
High Dexterity provides additional saving throws with a +2 for every point of
Dexterity above 16. A tiny bladed weapon allows the victim to escape in  half
time as well, which could aid a saving victim even more.

This  spell  conjures into being a glowing force bucket, capable  of  holding
about  3  gallons of liquid. It has as much use as you have smarts. Initially
used to get water out of icy rivers from the comfort of his home, it has been
seen  in  use  of  throwing oil on opponents, scooping  hunks  out  of  water
elementals,  and  going over other wizard's heads... it is not  tran  It  has
little  strength aside from its ability to tote water, therefore it is easily
lifted or batted about.

The material components for this spell are thimble and some hawk feathers.

This  spell requires a twig from a recently lightning struck oak and a  white
silk  ribbon. Casting this spell brings into being a glowing 3 inch  diameter
pole shaped brace in the location the caster desires. No amount of force  can
destroy the brace, though dispel magic will work. Note that the brace extends
some  of  its invulnerability to the object it holds up, so using it to  hold
closed a stone door makes the door fairly resistant to damage (granting a  +4
to all saving throws).

This  spell temporarily (and rather destructively) transforms a complete suit
of  plate  mail into a magical plate mail with one plus per 4 caster  levels.
The caster can "wear" this plate mail mentally, still allowing him to use his
hands to cast spells: the magical plate has mass nor weight, and it does  not
prevent magic use. It affects Armour Class as any other plate mail; when  the
duration ends the plate mail vanishes forever (as does the real one, which is
the material component).

This  spell  allows the caster to carve words onto almost  any  surface.  The
components are the words to be written, a mithril chisel of dwarven make, and
dragon  spittle. These words are permanent on the surface for 7000 years.  If
said  stone is destroyed, the words will appear as flaming letters  at  night
time.  If an abode is built to obstruct their original view, they will  begin
to  destroy  the home, using earthquake once a year at a random  time.  Tyvek
plans  to use this spell to retaliate on his friends on his deathbed.  Dispel
magic  will  not affect this spell, though a wish spell has a 70%  chance  of
working.

This  spell  requires a scrap of elven chain mail. It conjures into  being  a
body  shaped force shell that can resist any one attack. Its weakness is  its
short duration. Normally, it's used to avoid an apparent death blow. It would
allow  the  wizard  to take a boulder to the head and  live,  or  hold  up  a
collapsing ceiling for one round. No spell can penetrate it, and dispel magic
is  ineffective. Spellstrike is the only other known attack that would  work,
but who memorises spellstrike anyway but other abjurers.

Tired of continually polishing his blades and armour, Tyvek came up with rust
prevention. It keeps all forms of oxidation from occurring, even those caused
by  rust monsters. The material components of this spell are beeswax and some
iron  filings  rolled into said wax. The verbal component  is  "Ruh-stohl-ee-
ehm".  While the hands are moved in circular patterns over the item, the  wad
of  wax  and iron is consumed in the casting (by the spell, not the  caster).
Detect  magic  will reveal this magical protection. There is no saving  throw
unless the spell is used to protect versus magical rust. Then, there is a  +4
to the item saving throw as well.

This spell requires a tiny iron heart sculpture, lion's blood, and holy water
(or  unholy water if your recipient is evil). Casting it will have the effect
of  bestowing  1d10 HP per 5 caster levels. Its short casting time  and  life
saving potential mark it as Tyvek's possibly most useful spell. These phantom
hit  points take damage first, and can be used to revive a person at negative
hit  points  to waking life. Note, however, that these hit points  only  stay
until the end of the spell's duration.

This spell was Tyvek's attempt at creating a defense against wayward theft of
his life from the backstab of the common thief. Turtleback gives the caster a
back  of  near  stone hardness: when it is in place, a thief  must  make  two
attack  rolls.  If  either fails then he did not hit  the  caster  (and  thus
inflicts  no  damage), and he loses surprise. Note that it only  affects  the
caster.  Tyvek  has  moved on to higher level spells  and  never  devised  an
improved turtleback to use on others (lucky for you thieves).

The material component for this spell is a tiny scrap or a turtle shell.

does, this spell actually conjures a ball of fire directly from the elemental
plane  of  fire. When the spell is cast, a small interdimensional  connection
opens  between the plane of fire and the wizard's plane; the fireball  enters
through this opening and strikes the targets as directed by the wizard. There
is  a  chance that an extraplanar creature may enter through the  opening  as
well. The chance of this occurring is: 20% - 1% per level of the wizard (to a
minimum of 1%).
This  spell has the same effects (including damage) as the evocation version,
but  it  is slightly harder to produce these effects in this manner; this  is
reflected in the higher spell level and the reduced range and area of effect.

The  material components for this spell are a piece of flint and a  pinch  of
sulphur.

This spell is similar to Uldark's conjured lightning bolt (q.v.). It conjures
a bolt of frost and ice from the para-elemental plane of ice. The chance that
an  extraplanar creature enters the wizard's plane is the same as that of the
conjured  lightning bolt. The bolt is 50 feet long and 10 feet  wide;  anyone
hit by the bolt suffers 1d6 points of damage per level of the wizard (up to a
maximum  of 10d6). A successful saving throw versus spell reduces the  damage
by half.

The  material component for this spell is a large chunk of ice or snow;  this
is consumed with the casting.

This spell is similar to Uldark's conjured fireball except that it conjures a
lightning  bolt  from the quasi-elemental plane of lightning,  instead  of  a
fireball  from  the  plane of fire. The chance that an  extraplanar  creature
enters  the wizard's plane is the same as that of the conjured fireball.  The
effects of this spell are identical to that of the normal lightning bolt, but
the  area  of effect is either a bolt, 30 feet long and 10 feet  wide,  or  a
bolt, 60 feet long and 5 feet wide.

The  material components of this spell are a small metal rod and the skin  of
an electric eel.

When  this  spell is cast, a small interdimensional connection opens  between
the  quasi-elemental plane of radiance and the wizard's plane;  through  this
opening,  a  1 foot diameter glowing sphere appears and slowly hovers  around
the  wizard.  This sphere contains all colours of the spectrum;  this  sphere
will  last  for  2 rounds per level of the wizard; if not used  to  its  full
potential at that time, the sphere dissipates.
During  any  round which the sphere is in effect, the wizard may discharge  a
bolt  of  one colour of the spectrum; only one such attack may be made  in  a
single  round,  and the sphere may discharge only one bolt per  colour;  once
used,  that  colour  disappears from the sphere. When all colours  have  been
discharged,  or when the duration expires, the sphere dissipates.  Each  bolt
may affect one creature, and each colour has a unique composition as follows:

     Colour    Composition    Item Saving Throw versus
     red  fire magical fire
     orange    poison    -
     yellow    acid acid
     green     gas  -
     blue lightning lightning
     indigo    cold cold
     violet    force     crushing blow

All  bolts do a like amount of damage: 1d6 HP + 2 HP per level of the wizard.
A  successful saving throw versus spell reduces the damage by half.  If  this
saving  throw fails, the victim's possessions must save versus the  indicated
composition (if applicable) or be destroyed.
There  is a chance that an extraplanar creature may enter through the opening
whenever  this spell is cast. The chance of this occurring is: 20% -  1%  per
level  of the wizard (to a minimum of 1%). Any creature entering the wizard's
plane will normally be hostile to the wizard.

The  material component for this spell is a crystal or glass prism; light  is
sent  through the prism to create a specwhen the spell is cast. The prism  is
consumed with the casting of the spell.

This  spell  is Uldark's response to his friend Sillvatar's superior  summons
(q.v.); it is not as powerful (in terms of levels) as Sillvatar's spell,  but
is  more versatile, and requires less preparation time. This spell allows the
wizard  to summon any creature of the wizard's choice; only one such creature
may  be  summoned per casting of this spell, and the summoned creature's  Hit
Dice  may  be no more than two thirds the wizard's level (drop fractions).  A
certain species of creature may be specified in the summoning (or in the case
of  an  adventurer, class and level), but a specific individual  may  not  be
called; for example, the wizard may summon a 12th-level paladin, but may  not
summon a specific paladin by name.
The  summoned creature appears anywhere within the spell's range as  directed
by  the wizard. If a good wizard summons an evil creature (or if an evil  one
summons a good creature) both the creature and the wizard must roll a  saving
throw  versus spell. If the wizard succeeds and the creature fails, the spell
proceeds  normally;  if  the  wizard fails and  the  creature  succeeds,  the
creature  will  attack  the wizard immediately; if both  fail,  the  creature
ignores  the  wizard  (the wizard may still attempt to gain  control  of  the
summoned creature via some other magic).
Of  course, since Sillvatar's spell is reversible, Uldark felt his should  be
as  well. The reverse of this spell, Uldark's ultimate banishment, sends  the
previously summoned creature back to its place of origin. This will only work
on  a  creature  who was previously summoned by this spell. If  the  creature
fails a saving throw versus spell at -4, it is immediately sent back to where
it came from.

The material component for this is a ruby, diamond, or emerald worth at least
800 gp. The gem is consumed with the casting of the spell.

The  material components for this spell are a blessed slowed hourglass, a  6-
inch  piece of string and a 1 1-inch piece of grass, leather or paper  called
binding.  The  character that the spell is being cast upon  must,  while  the
spell  is being cast, tie 5 knots into the string and bind the string to  the
hourglass   with  the  binding.  Upon  successful  completion   the   binding
disappears. The string disintegrates at a rate of 1 knot per day.
The  character that the spell has been cast on will know the time, within  an
hour,  by  looking at the hourglass. If the character should lose either  the
string or the hourglass, the spell will be broken.
Due  to  the  intense  concentration involved  it  is  recommended  that  the
character is not be submitted to the spell more than twice a month.

      As  with  all  cantrips,  this one can be very  useful,  but  not  very
powerful. It manifests itself as a field of force that resembles an umbrella.
It  lasts  for  up to one hour per level of the wizard at most,  but  if  the
concentration of the wizard is broken for more than one round, it  will  fade
away.  It actually does have some form and is "worth" 6 HP, but only  magical
weapons will affect it.

This  spell  is a version of animate dead developed for immediate battlefield
use.  It animates corpses in the same manner as the 5th-level spell, but  the
magic  only  lasts  for  a limited time. Also, undead  army  is  very  quick,
requiring only a single word and a gesture. Those animated resemble ghouls in
all  ways,  including having 2 HD each. The wizard can animate one  of  these
creatures  for every two levels (round up). The ghouls created by this  spell
are  unusually hard to turn: treat them as if they were wraiths. They  cannot
be commanded or disrupted (command results are ignored; disrupted results are
treated as a turn).

This  spell  allows a necromancer to link the life of a living  being  to  an
undead creature. The undead can now draw on the hit points of the victim  for
combat  purposes.  The victim suffers the injuries that the  undead  normally
would.  This of course makes taking prisoners much more useful.  There  is  a
limit  of one linked victim per undead. The link is broken by a dispel  magic
or  when  the affected living creature dies. The material component  of  this
spell is an iron claw.

By  means  of  this spell the priest can "heal" an undead, restoring  to  its
"unlife" a number of hit points equal to 1d6 plus the caster's level. Gaseous
and  intangible undead can be "touched" by a caster reaching into  the  space
they  occupy. The spell prevents normal undead attacks or effects of  contact
with undead from affecting the caster.
The  reverse of this spell, drain undead, inflicts a like amount  of  damage.
Undead  "drain" damage is not gained as healing or extra hit  points  by  the
caster. The same protections against undead powers are given to the caster as
undead  regeneration confers. Only undead are affected by either  version  of
the spell.

      This  spell creates an empathetic link with undead, allowing  a  normal
reaction  roll  to determine interaction between the undead and  the  wizard.
Obviously,  if the wizard is hostile or a threat, then the reaction  roll  is
meaningless. The wizard receives normal Charisma bonuses, plus an  additional
5%. Generally, a friendly reaction roll just means a wary acceptance.

This spell allows the wizard get use both ESP and empathy on a creature if it
fails  a  saving  throw  versus spell with a -2 penalty.  For  more  detailed
information, like memories or motivations, someone else must ask  the  wizard
the question. The wizard's player can under no circumstances supply questions
for  other  people to ask! Doing so ends the spell immediately  (forcing  the
wizard back into his own mind). One question per round is reasonable for easy
questions, but long or complicated questions can take longer (up to the  DM).
A  common  language is not needed between wizard and target, and  the  wizard
always replies in the tongue he uses most. While the spell is in effect,  all
the wizard can do is answer questions without ending the spell. The spell can
be ended at any time, simply by willing it to end.
For  example: a wizard casts understanding on a dragon attacking a town,  and
learns  (by ESP and empathy) that it is angry and plans to destroy the  town.
The wizard's apprentice asks the wizard why the dragon is attacking, allowing
the  wizard to probe the dragon's memories, and to discover some humans stole
the  dragon's eggs. The wizard lets the spell end, to try to bargain with the
dragon.

This  spell  creates a warping effect only for those spells or  proficiencies
which  can identify which school of spells is cast. Once this spell is  cast,
the touched creature gains 3 spell levels per caster level. With these it can
cast  spells  in  such a way that any means that can determine  the  kind  of
school or even the name of the spell are thwarted in the same manner as a non-
detection  spell: the creature who casts the protected spell (not the  caster
of  the  detection spell) gains a saving throw versus spell; if it  succeeds,
nothing  will be detected; if it fails, the true spell school (or even  name)
will  be  detected. This spell cannot be used to block Rednog's magic  tracer
nor  Rednog's  identifier.  This spell can be used  multiple  times  until  a
maximum  of  12  times caster level in spell levels is reached.  This  spells
lasts  until  all spell levels are used up. The effects of this spell  remain
even  if  the caster is not present any more or if the spell which  was  cast
with  this spell has a permanent duration (or is made permanent): the  caster
casts  a  permanent illusion with this spell and leaves the area,  then  some
years later somebody tries to determine what spell was cast to give the  area
this  beautiful meadow look, the spell would have to save at the saving throw
of  the  original caster to prevent the detector from finding out what  spell
was cast.

The  material  component  is a mithril mirror with  many  differently  angled
polished  sides made from diamonds. This mirror has to be worth no less  than
5000 gp.
Some alignment problems have been noted with those who use this spell often -
not  due  to  character  actions, but due to the  spell:  it  may  cause  the
character  to forget his alignment as he tends to forget what kind of  spells
he  casts  during  this spell's effects. Once per week, he needs  to  make  a
Wisdom  check. If he fails, roll a die for the character's alignment for  the
next day (when he may try a next Wisdom check to regain his alignment):

     D10 Roll  Resulting alignment
     1    Chaotic evil
     2    Lawful Good
     3    True Neutral
     4    Lawful Evil
     5    Neutral Good
     6    Chaotic Neutral
     7    Neutral Evil
     8    Lawful Neutral
     9    Chaotic Good
     10   Truly insane (but only fun, OK?)

This  effect happens only to those characters that have a Wisdom of less than
or equal to 16 (thus, most wizards are affected).

Unentangle is used to allow creatures to pass through the area of  effect  of
an entangle spell cast by the same priest. If the spell is used to attempt to
pass  another  priest's entangle spell, the effects are  as  follows:  normal
movement  can take place if a saving throw versus spell is made, half  normal
movement if the saving throw fails.
This  spell also allows normal movement through the densest of forests, briar
thickets,  wall  of thorns, etc. The material component of this  spell  is  a
small edged weapon, which is consumed in the spell.

      This  is  a modified magic missile which flies in a perfectly  straight
path  from  the wizard's fingertips. It does not home in on its  target,  and
therefore  a saving throw versus spell is permitted to avoid the  effects  of
the  spell  (note: a separate saving throw is required for each missile).  In
exchange for this reduced effectiveness, the missiles are more damaging  than
normal  magic  missiles, inflicting 1d6+2 points of damage  per  missile.  In
every other way, this spell is identical to magic missile.

This spell can be cast only by a priest of (any) evil alignment. It generates
a  brilliantly radiant image of the casting priest's holy symbol.  No  matter
from  which direction the image is seen, it always appears to be viewed  from
the front. Creating the image requires a powdered gem of not less than 25,000
gp  value,  which is consumed entirely. The colour of the symbol is dependent
on  the  alignment  of the priest, as well as his strength  of  faith.  Rust,
midnight  blue,  and  blood-red are taken for  lawful,  neutral  and  chaotic
aligned clerics respectively. These colours are ethereal, wispy, and pale, as
if the image were made of smoke or flame.
The  first, immediate, effects are ones that take place to affect  undead.  A
maximum 25 HD of undead may be affected: lowest first, and any fraction  left
over can still affect the next creature if at least half of its Hit Dice  can
be affected. The following effects take place:
           All  undead are immediately restored to full hit points (and PSPs,
if  applicable),  and  they receive a bonus amount of  points  equal  to  the
caster's  level  as a reserve from which to subtract future damage  first  as
well.
           All mindless undead, even should they have had instructions from a
previous,  higher-level priest, follow the caster for  the  duration  of  the
spell.  The  are  controlled  by  mental contact:  any  sentient  undead  are
compelled to bodyguard the caster. However, they are free to act in their own
will underneath this one restriction.
           While  bathed in the light of the unholy presence, all the  undead
fight  at  +2 to-hit and inflict an extra amount of damage equal to half  the
caster's level.
Next,  the  general effects of the spell take place. A maximum of  30  HD  of
living  opponents  can be affected: lowest first, and a  fraction  left  over
still affects the next creature if at least half of that creature's Hit  Dice
can be affected. This affects the living as follows:
           Diametrically opposite aligned opponents take immediate damage  at
the rate of 5d4 plus the caster's level every round, and will continue to  do
so  until  they  either leave the area of effect, the  spell  expires  or  is
dispelled. The affected know what is causing the damage unless under charm or
feeblemind or something like that.
           Those  who  are good, but not diametrically opposite,  still  take
damage,  but  only  when the spell is initially cast: 3d6 plus  the  caster's
level in damage the first complete round the spell is in effect.
Additionally,  the caster can choose two of the following additional  effects
to take place:
          The caster is given +2 to everything: to-hit, damage, Armour Class,
saving throws, checks, turning, etc. Those with a bow have unerring aim  with
normal  shots,  called  shots get a 0 penalty. Anyone attacking  the  casting
priest while the spell is in effect suffers a  1 to-hit and a +1 Armour Class
penalty.
           Any  opponent  with  magic resistance  loses  some  of  its  magic
resistance in order to break this spell. Diametrically opposed have a penalty
of  20%,  identical  alignments have a penalty of 5%,  all  others  10%.  For
example: a neutral evil priest casts unholy presence. A chaotic good  warrior
with an intelligent sword bestowing 15% MR is penalized 10%, and is therefore
effectively 5% to break the spell.
           Any other spell, or item used to give a spell effect, cast or used
by  the  priest  at this time does maximum effect. Some may  even  be  doubly
effective, as determined by the DM.
           No  outer planar creature may enter the area of effect unless  its
alignment  matches that of the caster. This spell operates on the astral  and
ethereal  plane, and on the first layer of all the outer planes,  at  reduced
efficiency to be determined by the DM.
           An opposing priest of at least 4 levels higher than the caster  is
able to dispel another presence in effect, by casting his own version of  the
presence spell.
Two diametrically opposing presences with overlapping areas of effect cause a
vortex to consume all matter contained therein within a fraction of a second.
Also,  they cause a 10% chance that one of the involved deities will send  an
envoy  to  investigate  such a major disturbance. If each  side  successfully
sends such an entity, the event could become highly escalated. Any other  two
presences may overlap, combining or cancelling their benefits and penalties.
A  few  notes:  the  spell does take into account that  people  of  differing
alignments may make up the caster's party, and they are counted as allies and
friends  of the caster. On this point, the spell only acts against those  who
were counted as foes by the caster at the moment the casting of the spell  is
complete. Anyone who was in the caster's party is exempt from the spell, even
should they turn on the party while the spell is in effect.
Also,  it may be that the spell will fail those who have been less devout  in
their  practices. Either the spell may not work at all, or it might  backfire
and  affect  those  of  his  own alignment doubly, or  something  like  that.
Increase  the chance of being noticed by the deity to 5% while this spell  is
in  effect   things would have to be pretty serious to cause such a  casting,
or  the  priest is showing off and needs chastisement. The material component
of this spell is the caster's holy symbol.

With  this spell, the priest unleashes the forces of Mother Nature on a strip
of  land.  This includes hurricane force winds, floods, ravishing fires,  and
causing  natural  fault lines to send out earthquakes.  This  spell  is  very
dangerous  as  the priest tries to control the highest power of  spells    it
causes  him to make a system shock roll at half his Constitution. If  failed,
he  dies  from  the strain. Even if he makes this check, he is weak  for  the
duration  of  a full month: he has a 3 Strength and Constitution during  that
time. After that, he slowly regains these points: at a rate of one point  per
week. During this time the priest still has absolute control over the kind of
disaster  he  causes  in  the area of effect with the following  limits:  the
disasters  have  to be in the limits of nature. Thus, it is not  possible  to
cause  a  flood  on a mountain top or to cause the sea to burn  or  something
likewise  ridiculous. The limit is also that it is not possible  to  cause  a
ravishing firestorm within a flood area   but they can come one after another
if desired. But otherwise there can be a flood or a firestorm that destroys a
whole  countryside. These catastrophes can be fought by the usual methods  or
with  magic,  but  dispel magic does not work unless  it  is  cast  with  the
explicit  reason to cancel just this spell: it has to be cast at the  priest.
If  cast  just  to  cancel any magic on the priest  the  spell  will  not  be
cancelled.  On  the  other  hand: a dispel magic spell  will  dispel  unleash
natural  forces  with  a 100% chance if the dispel magic  is  cast  with  the
explicit  sense  of doing just that. The priest can change  the  catastrophes
from  week  to  week  within the spell's duration.  This  weather  cannot  be
controlled  by any other weather magic except by a god's direct  intervention
or by another spell cast for the explicit reason to counter this spell.
The  material components are the priest's holy symbol plus an item to control
each  of the elements which are to be used during the spell. These items have
to  be  sanctioned  for  one complete year each in the  appropriate  opposite
element without coming into contact with the other elements. Thus, a stone of
controlling earth elementals has to be levitated in a wall of force  so  that
it  is  not touched by anything or anyone else but air during the next  year,
the  brazier of controlling fire elementals has to be lowered into  the  sea,
etc. If the item is not completely sealed away from the other elements during
the  whole  year  the spell fails and the priest stays at his weakened  state
permanently.

This  powerful  magic enables the caster to create undead  from  corpses  and
skeletal  remains. Undead take 20 turns (minus the level of  the  caster)  to
come  to  unlife, and upon appearance, will attempt to carry out one task  or
action  stated  in he spell-casting (typically, to attack the first  creature
other  than  the  caster to enter the place where the spell  was  cast).  The
created  undead is not otherwise under the control of the caster. The  caster
has a 7% chance per level over 13 of successfully choosing the type of undead
created.  Otherwise, roll 1d100 and check in the appropriate  column  of  the
following  table to determine what sort of undead the carrion is  transformed
into.

Note that the undead created must be of a Hit Dice equal to or less than  the
level  the corpse had while alive. If the table indicates a type higher  than
this, the remains are animated as the most powerful type of creature they can
be,  i.e., an undead equal (or as near as possible) to the victim's  original
level. Normally, only a single undead can be created by this spell. Sometimes
(2 in 6 chance) two or three may be inadvertently created if other carrion is
within  20  feet of the casting. Types of extra undead cannot be selected  by
the  caster,  nor are such extra undead obligated to carry out  any  task  or
refrain  from  attacking  the caster, who may not  even  be  aware  of  their
existence.
The  reverse of this spell, go down, causes a single undead to be reduced  to
lifeless  remains  (if non-corporeal, it is reduced to  dust  forever).  Such
remains  (but  not  dust) could be reanimated by later  magic.  The  material
components for both forms of the spell are a pinch of dust, a drop of  blood,
a drop of water, and a fragment of bone.

      This  spell is used to disguise existing food or to create a completely
illusionary  meal.  The illusion will have full visual,  thermal,  touch  and
smell components.

      With  the  former  usage, a bland meal can be made  to  appear  in  all
respects  as a royal feast (or vice versa), and even spoiled food  or  poison
can  seem  irresistible.  The  serving  vessels  and  utensils  can  also  be
disguised. Spoiled foods will often cause nausea, and as a general rule, if a
saving  throw versus poison is failed, a character will be incapacitated  for
3d6  rounds  following a 2d8 round onset time. Allow a 25% or greater  chance
(depending  upon  what  was eaten) for more serious  poisoning  lasting  4d12
hours.  Both  slow  poison  and  neutralise  poison  would  be  effective  in
countering  these symptoms). A saving throw versus spell is not  given  until
the creature actually begins to consume the affected meal, and it is made  at
-4  unless a close examination of the food is made. If failed, the diner will
believe  the  illusion to be real, and will have no cause for alarm.  If  the
saving  throw is successful, the creature will see the meal's true form,  and
will be aware of the presence of an illusion.
If  a  complete illusionary meal is consumed, a victim will believe that  his
hunger  and  thirst have been satiated, but only for as long as  the  spell's
duration.  A  saving throw is allowed, being the same as that of  the  former
application of the spell.

      The spell requires the wizard to sprinkle a pinch of gold dust over the
food (or air) where the illusion is to be created.

Attempt  to  strangulate the victim with telekinesis.  The  victim
must  save vs. petrification or stay paralyzed and can do nothing.
Saving  or not the victim receive 1d6 of damage per round  and  -2
penalty  in  all  attack rolls and armor class. If the  psionicist
receive  some  physical damage the victim is free. The  psionicist
cannot  attack the victim anyway or the victim will be  free.  The
victim  must  need  air  to receive the damage  and  must  have  a
identifiable throat.
      For  victims with strength score greater than the psionicist
score  the  DM can allow a contest (victim strength vs  psionicist
wisdom) to escape the paralyzation.
     Free Action protects against the damage and the paralyzation.
Another  psionicist with this power can negate the attack. Another
psionicist  with telekinesis can grant to the victim another  save
vs. paralyzation.
     Reference: Dart Vader in Star Wars (Movie)

Power Score:  The victim saves against the paralyzation at -4.

20:   The psionicist suffer partial suffocation for 2 rounds  (1d4
of damage and -1 penalty).

Using  this spell, the wizard may create an army of semi-real humanoids;  any
type  of  humanoid may be chosen, but all soldiers must be of the same  type.
Because  the army is somewhat real, they may not be disbelieved. The army  is
made  up  of  one or more "units", each of which is comprised of 10  infantry
soldiers.  The wizard may create a number of units according to the following
table:

     Level     Number of Units
     14-15     2
     16-17     3
     18-19     4
     20+  5

The army may appear anywhere within spell range as desired by the wizard. The
army  must not stray too far from the wizard; they may move up to a  distance
of  20  yards per level of the wizard. This spell will last until the  wizard
wishes  it  to end, or until all units of the army are destroyed; however,  a
single wizard may not have more than two of these spells in effect at any one
time; any additional castings of the spell will fizzle and be wasted.
Each  unit  always moves and attacks as a single entity; it will never  split
up, or act independently, as each unit is a single component of the illusion.
The  unit will have an Armour Class equal to 22 minus the wizard's level, and
hit  points equal to 2 times the wizard's level (i.e. a 16th-level wizard may
create 3 units, each having an Armour Class of 6 and 32 HP). All hits on  the
unit count against the unit's hit point total; an individual soldier may  not
be  destroyed, even if all hits are on a single target. Once the  unit's  hit
point  total is exceeded, all 10 soldiers in that unit are destroyed. Besides
melee  attacks,  the army may be dispelled, although only  one  unit  may  be
dispelled per dispel attempt.
Each unit will be equipped with armour appropriate to their Armour Class, and
will be armed according to what material components are used; the wizard  may
provide one or more weapons for every unit he creates; the units will then be
armed with the corresponding weapon(s). Any number of weapons may be given to
a  single unit, and each unit may be equipped differently from the rest;  the
only  stipulation is that the wizard must have the appropriate number of  the
desired  weapons  available when the spell is cast (in the  case  of  missile
weapons, the missiles themselves need not be used as a component; the missile
weapon  suffices  in  this case). Continuing the example  of  the  16th-level
wizard,  the wizard may elect to equip all 3 units with longswords  only  (at
the cost of 3 longswords as a material component) or may wish to diversify by
equipping one with long bows and short swords, one with spears, and the third
with halberds; (at the cost of 1 each of a long bow, short sword, spear,  and
halberd as a material component).
Since a unit always acts as a group, it may only make one or two attacks  per
round,  unless  equipped with a weapon that normally allows multiple  attacks
(i.e. a unit of long bow archers would receive 2 or 4 attacks per round).  If
the  unit makes only one melee attack in a round, it will inflict 1d8  points
of damage if successful; if two melee attacks are made, each will inflict 1d4
points of damage if a hit is scored; the amount of damage does not depend  on
the type of weapon used - all cause the same amount of damage.
Missile  attacks cause 1d4 points of damage if the minimum number of  attacks
are  made,  or  1d2  points of damage if the maximum number  of  attacks  are
conducted (i.e. a unit using long bows would do 1d4 points of damage per  hit
if  two  attacks  are  made, or 1d2 points of damage  per  hit  if  making  4
attacks).
Hurled  weapons  are  not allowed by this spell. Under no  circumstances  may
these  illusionary  armies use any special attack or defense  forms  normally
employed  by  their  race  (i.e.  an illusionary  army  of  trolls  will  not
regenerate lost hit points). Strength, Dexterity, and similar bonuses also do
not apply.
In  addition to the weapons required for material components, the wizard must
also  have  a  suit  of armour (and a shield, if desired) that  comprise  the
appropriate  Armour Class for the units. One suit (and shield,  if  used)  is
sufficient  for all units created by this spell. All material components  are
consumed when the spell ends.

This spell is used by a wizard who truly appreciates the many uses of one  of
man's  greatest creations, the ladder. In this spell, a ladder of pure energy
is emitted from the caster's fingertips. The ladder consists of as many rungs
as  the  caster  has  levels.  When the ladder hits  the  target,  the  rungs
progressively  burst on the target for 1d4 points of damage per  rung,  to  a
maximum  of 10d4. A successful saving throw indicates the target has  managed
to dodge some part of the ladder, and damage is reduced to 1 point per rung.

The material component of the spell is a one inch diameter by a section of  a
ladder  rung,  half an inch long. On one side is written "Spell  Use  Only  -
Evocation  Department".  On  the  other is  a  large  "V"  with  the  letters
"I.G.A.F." below it.

This  spell is identical to Vandergast's forcetrap in appearance and  effect,
with  the  following exceptions: a bend bars attempt is useless against  this
spell; instead, enough damage must be inflicted on the bands to destroy them.
This  damage may be caused by weapons (piercing and slashing weapons only  do
half  damage,  blunt weapons inflict full damage) or spells. Also,  only  one
target  may be trapped by this spell. Finally, a limited wish will not affect
this  spell,  although  a wish will destroy it, and a dispel  magic  has  the
normal chance of success against the bands.
The  bands have AC 0 and 5 HP for every level of the wizard. When the  bands'
hit  point  total has been exceeded, the bands are destroyed, and  the  spell
ends.  Each  attack that inflicts damage on the bands will also inflict  half
that  damage  total (rounded down) on the trapped victim unless a  successful
saving  throw  versus  paralysation is made (in  which  case,  no  damage  is
suffered). For example, if the bands are struck for 11 points of damage, they
suffer  the  full  11 points, while the trapped victim suffers  5  points  of
damage, unless his saving throw was successful.

When  this  spell  is cast, a shimmering blue bolt shoots from  the  wizard's
finger  towards the target; when the target is struck, the bolt  erupts  into
multiple bands of force that envelop the victim. If a successful saving throw
versus spell is made, the spell dissipates and has no effect; otherwise,  the
bands of force will render the target completely immobile by normal means, as
his hands, feet, etc., will be snugly bound. The target may still levitate or
employ  other  means  of  magical movement, but may  not  walk,  cast  spells
requiring  a somatic component, or fight. Any size target may be affected  by
this spell.
The  bands of force may not be harmed by weapons or most spells, but  may  be
dispelled; a wish or limited wish will also destroy the bands. The only other
way  to  escape the bands is to roll a successful bend bars check. The victim
may make one such attempt each round; in addition, exactly one attempt may be
made  each  round from an external source; if anyone touches the bands  after
the  first  external bend bars attempt (including another bend bars  attempt,
striking  the  bands with a weapon, etc.) the person touching  the  bands  is
immediately trapped as well, with no saving throw. If two or more persons are
trapped  by  this spell, each earns a bend bars roll each round; however,  no
external  attempts may be made, or that person will also become  trapped.  In
any  case, if a bend bars roll is successful, the bands break, and the spells
ends immediately.

This  spell  creates  a momentary vacuum inside the area  of  effect.  Anyone
caught  inside this area must save versus spell to avoid the crushing effects
of  the  vacuum. If the saving throw fails, the victim suffers 8d8 points  of
crushing damage; all possessions must save versus crushing blow at -4  or  be
destroyed.  Anyone  who dies outright from this spell has  more  than  likely
(65%)  been torn asunder from the pressure differential. Note that  this  may
make  regeneration  difficult, if not impossible.  If  the  saving  throw  is
successful, the target suffers 4d8 points of damage, and possessions are  not
affected.

The  material components for this spell is an empty vial of which the stopper
is removed and which is broken at the time of the casting.

Vanquil's backbiter is a way of protecting against a thief's backstab attack.
The  spell  is  triggered  when  any non-missile,  non-energy  (i.e.,  magic,
psionics,  breath  weapon,  etc.) hits the wizard  from  behind  without  his
knowledge. A backstthief or an invisible or silenced fighter counts, so  long
as the wizard is surprised. The spell is considered activated when the weapon
of  such  a  person  comes within 3 inches (¬ foot)  of  the  wizard's  back.
Activation  requires  no  thought or effort from the  wizard:  the  backbiter
cannot be consciously activated.
When  activated, the spell instantly creates a brief stoneskin effect on  the
wizard's  back,  preventing the weapon from doing any damage  (on  the  first
attack).  It  then releases a burst of energy missiles (similar  to  a  magic
missile)  at  the backstabber, causing 1d2 HP of damage per level  (up  to  a
maximum  of 10d2). The energy missiles never miss, and a shield or protection
from normal missiles will not prevent damage.
Only  one  backbiter  can be in effect at any one time. If  another  is  cast
before  the  first is used, it is lost. The material components are  a  small
diamond of any size and the eyes of a common housefly.

Cellular regeneration is a spell that increases the growth rate of the body's
various tissues, causing them to mend together faster. Once the recipient  is
touched,  the spell begins to work, restoring damage according to  the  table
below:

     Round     Healing
     1    1 HP of damage
     2    1d4 HP of damage
     3    1d4 HP of damage
     4    1 HP of damage

If  the  recipient performs any strenuous activity during the spell  duration
(like combat, casting spells over third level, or using a psionic power  that
requires  a  Constitution check), the spell is immediately aborted.  All  hit
points  are gained at the end of the appropriate round. Due to the stress  of
regeneration,  this  spell  cannot be cast more  than  once  per  person  for
increased  healing. For the spell to be effective again, the  recipient  must
take more damage.

The  material  component is a piece of troll flesh that has  been  burned  in
acid.
Note: this spell is intended to give wizards some curative abilities, not  to
replace  priests.  The spell is much less powerful than the  equivalent  cure
serious wounds, both in terms of damage and limitations. I would suggest that
DMs  limit  the  spell  to be useful to a single person  only  once  per  day
(regardless  of injuries). If you wish to increase the level  of  the  spell,
that's  up  to  you. I would not recommend banning it - unless  all  the  NPC
necromancers  in  your world are murderous scum with an  obsession  for  dead
things.

     By casting this spell, the caster causes the objects inside a small soft
container  carried  by  him (like a backpack or the pockets  in  a  piece  of
clothing) to stick together and to the inside of the container. The caster is
not  affected by this "clinging" (there is no resistance for him), but others
must  give  a strong pull to remove the items. The result is that  a  thief's
chance  to  pick  pockets decreases by 5% per level of the  caster,  but  the
caster's  chance of noticing a pick pockets attempt doubles (whether  it  was
successful or not).

The material component is a bit of glue and some lint.

This  spell is almost identical to the 1st-level version, except in the  area
of  effect:  the  caster can choose a person to bestow this spell  upon,  who
gains  all  the  benefits of the spell and is not hindered by it.  Also,  all
pockets,  pouches, backpacks, etc. that the person is carrying are  protected
by one casting of this spell.

This  spell is a cold-based version of cloudkill, creating a light grey cloud
that  leaves  frost  in its wake. It functions just like a cloudkill,  except
that  damage comes from cold, making fire based creatures more vulnerable  to
the spell (treat them as having 2 fewer Hit Dice, and they automatically take
double  damage).  Creatures who fail their saving throw  by  4  or  more  are
encased  in a thin layer of ice (about a quarter of an inch). Those who  make
their saving throws still take appropriate damage (1d10).

might even find it refreshing.

This  is  an modified version of cone of cold that affects only one creature.
It  creates a beam of intense cold 5 feet long per wizard level, but  only  a
tenth of an inch wide. If the target fails its saving throw versus spell,  it
takes 1d8 points of damage per wizard level (up to 12d8). If the target makes
its  saving throw, it narrowly dodges the beam, but is close enough  for  its
body  heat  to dissipate the beam. Of course, that also means the beam  cools
down  the target, causing 1 point of damage per wizard level (up to a maximum
of 12).
Creatures  that  are  cold-based (like white dragons or ice  para-elementals)
take  no  damage from this spell, but fire-based creatures (like red  dragons
and  salamanders) take +1 point of damage per Hit Die. Undead take no  damage
from this spell.

There  are  actually 2 different iceball spells: an evocation version  and  a
conjuration version. Both versions do 1d6 HP of damage per level, up to  10d6
of  damage,  with a saving throw for half damage. The area  of  effect  is  a
sphere with a 20-foot radius. The spells differ as follows:
Evocation: the spell drains thermal energy from the affected area,  producing
intense  cold.  There  is  no pressure caused by the  iceball,  so  unlike  a
fireball,  the  chilled  area  conforms to the surroundings  (like  Snilloc's
snowball  swarm).  Therefore, it can be used in confined  areas  without  the
danger  of a backfire. The evocation iceball will freeze all exposed  liquids
and,  if  cast  underwater,  will  create a  40-foot  diameter  ball  of  ice
(creatures inside the area may save versus paralysation to avoid entrapment).
The  ball  of ice will immediately float to the surface. Creatures immune  to
cold take no damage from this version.
Conjuration:  this  version draws forth ice and cold from the  para-elemental
plane  of ice, causing a destructive blast of ice. The conjured iceball  will
not  conform to its surroundings, and will expand to its full area of effect,
just like a fireball. Underwater, this version does only 1d4 points of damage
per  level,  and  does  not create any large pieces of ice.  Fragile  objects
(vials,  mirrors,  etc.) must save versus crushing blow to  survive  the  ice
barrage.  Creatures immune to cold will still take 1d2 HP of physical  damage
per  level (unless immune to normal missiles). Because this version  accesses
an elemental plane, it will not function while spelljamming in the Flow or in
other situations where access to the elemental planes is cut off.

This spell is a mixed blessing. It prevents the subject from feeling any kind
of  pain, either from wounds or artificially induced (i.e., magic, psionics).
Thus, wizards and psionicists can use their abilities regardless of what kind
of  damage  they take in a round, and tortures and pain-inflicting  abilities
(like  the  psionic Inflict Pain) do not affect the recipient.  On  the  down
side,  the recipient is unaware of any hit point losses, poisoning,  disease,
etc.,  and  does not know if he has been hit or needs healing. The  recipient
could be down to 1 hit point and not know it. Low Intelligence creatures tend
to  feel  invulnerable  while under this spell (no pain,  no  injury),  while
higher Intelligence ones realize the danger of the situation.
Unwilling creatures get a saving throw versus spell.

This  spell  increases  the recipient's metabolism  and  reflexes,  improving
performance  in  combat.  The recipient receives  a  temporary  +1  bonus  to
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and give a +bonus to initiative. Also,
saving  throws  versus  death  magic or breath weapon  receive  a  +1  bonus.
Finally, the recipient gets a +1 bonus against being surprised.
The  spell has some drawbacks and limitations. A wizard cannot have more than
one  of  these spells active per every six levels (2 at twelfth level,  3  at
eighteenth level, etc.). The recipient can have only one of these spells cast
upon  him at any time: having another cast causes a heart attack (save versus
death  magic  with  no bonuses, or die instantly). Only the  first  casting's
benefits applies if the person lives, but the penalties are cumulative.
The  recipient feels energized while the spell is active, but extremely tired
and  weak  after  it ends. For every hour after the spell  expires  that  the
recipient  does not get a full night's sleep, he has a cumulative -1  penalty
to  Strength  and  Constitution, plus a constant  penalty  of  -1  for  being
surprised and a -2 penalty to initiative.
Also,  the  recipient  cannot fall asleep while increased  metabolism  is  in
effect.  Any applicable penalties for sleep deprivation apply when the  spell
ends:  wizards  and priests under this spell cannot rest to re-learn  spells,
nor can psionicists regain PSPs. Sleep inducing magics, psionics, and poisons
still work normally, and the recipient can still be rendered unconscious from
damage  received. The recipient must also eat and drink twice as much  as  he
normally would.

The  material  component  is  blood  from  a  quickling,  or  any  non-undead
regenerating  creature. This spell was created to give higher  level  wizards
and necromancers a way to empower minions without the use of animate dead.

Lightshed is a spell that creates multiple continual light spheres,  one  per
level.  The wizard can create one continual light sphere per round,  and  can
take  any  actions while the spell is in effect (except cast  other  spells).
Continual light spheres can be created as often as the wizard wishes,  up  to
the  spell's  limits.  The  spheres created by lightshed  are  permanent  and
essentially the same as continual light, but Lightshed cannot be used against
a living creature (attempting to do so will end the spell).
Lightshed  was  created  so  that a wizard could quickly  and  easily  "cast"
multiple  continual  light spells per day, without  wasting  every  2nd-level
spell available. This spell is also useful for wizards who wish to earn money
by  lighting  up  local castles or dungeons, since the  average  price  of  a
continual light is 50 gp per sphere.

Milling crowd summons people to enter a crowd and interact with the people in
the  crowd.  The conjured people can try to impart one opinion or emotion  of
the  wizard's  choosing, thus changing the crowd's mood or opinion.  Thus,  a
group  of  angry  protestors could be made to riot, become less  violent,  or
protest  a different (but related) topic. The spell summons one "person"  per
level, who can only be used to influence crowd reactions. Any attempts by the
wizard to attack the summoned people, use them as barriers, or use the in any
way not associated with interaction will terminate the spell immediately. The
people  will  be of the same racial mix as the crowd they must infiltrate  (a
crowd of 75% humans and 25% gnomes would result in 75% of the summoned people
to be human, 25% to be gnomish).
The  spell can influence a crowd in one of two ways: it can either change the
reaction adjustment of the crowd by one factor, or it can be used to give the
crowd  another direction. For example, milling crowd can either make a  group
more  hostile  or less hostile, or it can change the group's  focus  in  some
minor  way.  If  the group wanted to hang someone at noon,  the  spell  could
"suggest"  an  alternate  means of execution, or a  change  in  the  time  of
execution, etc.
The saving throw for the crowd uses the average Hit Dice for the saving throw
versus spell. If the wizard is trying to influence reactions, the crowd has a
-3  penalty  on  the saving throw. If the spell is trying to give  the  crowd
other  ideas,  the  saving throw is made without penalty.  Depending  on  the
nature of crowd and their focus of attention, it is not unreasonable to  have
saving  throw  modifiers  from  +5 to -5 (ranging  from  agreement  with  the
wizard's purpose to considerable opposition). The spell is not guaranteed  to
work  if it encounters some form of absolute resistance (for example, a local
custom  dictating the means and time of execution). If the  crowd  makes  its
saving  throw, it is unaffected. If the roll is a natural 20,  the  crowd  is
aware  of  attempts to manipulate it. It is important to note that the  spell
does not directly affect the crowd in any way, so magic resistance is useless
and spells like detect charm will reveal nothing.

This  spell  functions like improved version of Snilloc's snowball  (although
developed without knowledge of Snilloc or his spells). When cast, it  creates
a  blue-white snowball in the wizard's hand, which is then thrown in the same
round,  with a chance to hit equal to the wizard's THAC0 plus 3. As it  flies
towards the target, the snowball expands to become a 3-foot diameter mound of
snow.  Neither shield nor protection from normal missiles (or similar spells)
will  stop the snowball, but a minor globe of invulnerability will.  Immunity
to  cold will not prevent damage, nor being knocked over if the saving  throw
is failed, but will prevent the target from being unable to cast spells.
If  the  target makes his saving throw versus spell, he takes 1d2  points  of
damage  per  wizard  level (maximum 8d2 points of damage),  and  cannot  cast
spells in that round or the next round.
If  the  target  fails his saving throw, he takes 1d2 points  of  damage  per
wizard level (up to 8d2), is knocked down (i.e., prone), and the intense cold
prevents  spellcasting for the next 1d6+1 rounds (due to severe  shivers  and
chattering teeth).
This  spell  was developed as an anti-spellcaster weapon, and definitely  not
intended for general use. It appears here only because the formula was stolen
by  an ungrateful apprentice of the elven mage Vanquil. Despite the fact that
the  apprentice was killed by Vanquil himself less than two weeks  after  the
theft, the spell had already been circulated to several unscrupulous wizards.

This  spell is a lesser version of Leomund's tiny hut. It will keep out winds
of  up  to 50 miles per hour, as well as any one type of precipitation (rain,
snow, sleet, hail, etc.) that is named at casting time and cannot be changed.
For  example, if the spell was cast to keep out rain, but the weather changed
to  hail,  the  hail would be able to enter the tent. As with Leomund's  tiny
hut,  the wizard cannot leave the tent without ending the spell. Temperatures
inside  the tent are the same as those outside the tent, but there is  enough
room inside for a small fire.
Vanquil  developed this spell as a lower-level alternative to the  tiny  hut,
since he typically used all of his 3rd-level spells in combat.

Vanquil's  wall of detection creates an invisible, intangible wall  that  can
mimic  the  function of several divination spells, and relay that information
to  the  caster.  The wall is immobile, flat and vertical, but  it  needs  no
physical support and works through solid objects (like floors). However,  the
caster must have been able to physically see the area when he cast the  wall,
and  be within 10 feet per level of the area. After the spell has been  cast,
the  wizard  can  move up to 50 feet per level away from the wall  and  still
receive  information from it. Moving outside that range causes no information
to be received from the wall (the information is simply "lost").
The  spellcaster gets one "slot" for the wall's powers for every three levels
of  experience,  rounded  down  (a  12th-level  wizard  would  have  4  slots
available). The wizard can then choose which effects are desired  (until  all
slots are filled): the effects cannot be changed. The cost for each effect is
listed below.
One slot each:
           Limited  clairvoyance: the caster receives blurry images  of  what
passed through the wall. These images represent only a general form, and  not
specific  shapes. The caster could tell a rock from a stick from a  humanoid,
but not a dwarf from an elf. If the object or creature is invisible, or there
is  insufficient  light, this effect will reveal no information.  Infravision
other the wall's version is not compatible with this effect.
           Detect  disease:  the  caster becomes aware  that  something  that
touched the wall is diseased.
           Detect  evil: the caster becomes aware that something that touched
the wall is of evil alignment.
           Detect  good: the caster becomes aware that something that touched
the wall is good-aligned.
           Detect invisibility: the caster becomes aware that something  that
touched  the  wall is invisible. If a visual power was chosen  as  well,  the
wizard will be able to see the invisible object.
           Detect  magic:  the  caster becomes aware that  something  magical
touched the wall. Being a spellcaster does not mean a person is magic; only a
magic item or spell will trigger this effect.
           Detect  undead: the caster becomes aware that some type of  undead
came into contact with the wall.
           "Infravision": the caster is aware of the relative temperature  of
everything that touches the wall: very hot (over 90 F), warm (70 -90 F), cool
(40 -70 F), or cold (under 40 F). Most inanimate objects (and undead) will be
close  to  the  same temperature as the air. This power can be combined  with
visual powers for true infravision.
           Know alignment: the caster becomes aware of the law or chaos  side
of alignment for any creature that touches the wall.
           Know school: the caster becomes aware of the school specialization
of any wizard who touches the wall. If the person is not a specialist wizard,
this option has no effect.
           Penetration awareness: the caster becomes aware of the  number  of
creatures  or  objects  that  touched the wall,  and  general  size  (as  per
Monstrous Compendium sizes: tiny through huge). This effect does not give any
visual  information, but will detect invisible creatures and works regardless
of the illumination level.
Two slots each:
          Clairaudience: the caster can hear everything within 30 feet of the
wall.
           Clairvoyance: the caster can see everything within 30 feet of  the
wall,  illuminated.  Natural infravision will  not  work  with  the  wall  of
detection;  the  wall's infravision power must be used.  Invisible  creatures
cannot be seen (unless the detect invisibility power was chosen).
           ESP: the caster gets an idea of the surface thoughts going through
a creature's mind for the entire round.
           Know  full  alignment: the caster learns the full alignment  of  a
creature  that  passes through the wall. This includes both the  lawful,  the
chaotic, the good, and the evil side.
When  something passes through the wall of detection, the wizard is aware  of
it  only  if  one of the detection effects was triggered, or a  visual  power
(like  (limited) clairvoyance or penetration awareness) was used.  Without  a
visual  power,  the  caster  will  not know how  many  creatures  or  objects
triggered the detection effect, or the specific object or creature  that  was
the  trigger.  Although  the wall can pass through physical  objects,  visual
powers cannot.
For example, a 9th-level wizard casts a wall of detection, and chooses detect
good, detect magic, and detect undead. The wizard would be totally unaware if
a  group of poor assassins passed through the wall (not good, no magics,  and
not  undead). If ten paladins and one assassin passed through the  wall,  the
wizard would be aware that something good-aligned (and possibly having magic)
passed through the wall, but the wizard would not know how many creatures  or
objects  passed through, nor would he know which ones were good or possessing
magic.  If the wizard had chosen detect good and clairvoyance, he would  know
which  persons  were  of  good alignment, what they  looked  like,  and  what
everyone within 30 feet of the wall was doing.
Since  the wall is hair-thin, the information last for only a fraction  of  a
second  unless the creature or object pauses inside the wall. In other words,
the  DM  should only tell the player the information once. Also, it is nearly
impossible to gauge an object's speed unless it comes to a near stop while in
the  area of effect. The incoming information does not "overload" the  caster
or disrupt spellcasting.
Other  spells can detect the wall of detection. Detect magic will  show  that
there  is  something in the wall's position (it won't reveal  anything  else,
except  possibly the school), and detect invisible will allow the  caster  of
that spell to actually see the wall. Detect scrying will reveal the existence
of  the  wall  and  its location, but not the wall's caster.  If  a  wall  of
detection is inside an area protected by Mordenkainen's psanctum, the  wizard
cannot receive information from the wall unless he enters the area of effect.

The  material components are two different sensory organs from two  different
magical  creatures.  Also, if the central eye of a  beholder  is  used  as  a
material component, the wall of detection cannot be detected by detect magic,
detect invisibility, or detect scrying.

Vanquil's wall of light creates an opaque horizontal or vertical wall,  which
appears  to  be pure white in colour, and glowing softly (providing  as  much
illumination  as  a  candle). Both sides of the wall  have  this  appearance.
Inside  the  wall is a different story: it is brighter than the  sun  on  the
inside.  Any  creature whose eyes (or other visual organs) pass  through  the
wall  must  make  two  saving throws. If both are  successful,  the  creature
suffers  no  ill effects. If only one saving throw is made, the  creature  is
blinded for one round per level of the spellcaster. If both saving throws are
failed, the creature is blinded permanently.
The  wall  of light can be created such that the area of the wall is  halved,
but  the  thickness is doubled. For each inch of thickness after  the  first,
everyone who passes through the wall makes their saving throws against spells
at  a  -1 penalty. If the wall of light was 3 inches thick, the saving  throw
penalties would be -2 on each saving throw versus spell. The thickness can be
increased  as many times as the caster wishes, provided that the  length  and
width are decreased appropriately.
The wall of light must be flat, but needs no physical support or connections,
unlike a wall of stone or wall of iron. It can even be cast in midair, or  in
the  vacuum of wildspace. Note that the area of effect is measured in  square
feet, not a square with sides 20 feet per level.
The  wall offers no impediment to entry and exit, and missile weapons can  be
fired (blindly) through the wall. Creatures that are blind, or do not rely on
normal  visual light are unaffected by this spell. Underground  dwellers,  or
other  creatures that suffer penalties for being in full sunlight make  their
saving  throws  at a -3 penalty. Undead harmed by sunlight are unaffected  by
this  spell, except for the effects suffered by living creatures. Individuals
who  know the nature of this spell (that it's extremely bright on the inside)
can  attempt  to  cover their eyes. Such individuals only need  to  make  one
saving  throw with a +1 bonus; if failed, they are blinded for  1  round  per
caster  level (preparations were insufficient). If one melee round  is  spent
covering  the eyes (with bandages, cloaks, or anything difficult or creative)
the saving throw bonus increases to +5.

The  material component is a live glowbug, a pinch of phosphorus, and a pinch
of magnesium.

This  power can change the speed of any object.  It can  halt  any
missile weapon of low speeds, or double the speed as well.   Large
objects or fast moving ones can be slowed or sped up as well,  but
not  stopped completely.  Any missile weapon except a crossbow  or
heavy  missile weapons (catapult, boulders, balista,  etc.)   This
power  can only alter the speed of the missile weapon if the power
is  activated  before  the missile hits and  after  it  is  fired.
Crossbow  bolts  can be slowed so that they cause 1/2  damage,  as
well  as ballista, catapults and other heavy missile weapons.   If
the speed is doubled, the damage is also doubled.

Power Score:  Any object can be stopped or sped up.

20:    The  object's  speed  changes  in  the  opposite  direction
intended.

With  the use of this spell, a wizard may summon a number of servants from  a
currently  unknown location. This spell is rare due to the material component
required.  Each servant requires the presence of one tooth from an  adult  or
older  dragon.  There  is no limit to the number of  creatures  that  may  be
summoned  with each casting. It is important to know the type of dragon  that
the tooth originated from at the time of casting.
The  servants are 5+3 HD, have the Armour Class of the original dragon  minus
three,  have  two claw attacks for 1d6 damage each, have a breath  weapon  as
their special attack, and move at MV 12; flight: 18 (C). The servants are  6-
foot tall winged humanoid dragon creatures. The coloration is as the original
dragon  and  the breath weapon (of the appropriate type) is 5d6, three  times
per day.
"Servant" however, is a misleading title since only if the eye-teeth  of  the
dragon  are  used  and  correctly named will the summoned  beings  serve  the
caster.  In all other cases the procedure goes astray and the "servants"  are
uncontrollable  and smitten with the unstoppable desire to slay  the  caster.
This  is  where Veringen met his end: when attempting to alter the  spell  to
work  on  any tooth from a dragon, he cast a double handful to the floor  and
was torn asunder by his creations. Servants speak the languages of the caster
plus   the  original  dragon  type's.  Additionally,  opposing  colour  types
(chromatic versus metallic) will attack each other wildly on sight.
This spell continues giving descriptions of the sort of missions that will or
won't  be  undertaken  by  the servant. A copy of this  spell  will  be  made
available to anyone who can predict the exact restrictions.

Those  affected  by this spell must save versus spell or suffer  from  severe
vertigo.  If  a creature fails its saving throw, there is a 50%  chance  each
round  that  they will be overcome with vertigo and be forced to sit  or  lie
down. If on a cliff (or similar) they will fall. Creatures forced to sit down
are  unable to do anything that round and in effect stunned (+2 to  hit  such
creatures).  Those  that remain on their feet suffer a +3 penalty  to  Armour
Class  and  a  -2  penalty  on attack rolls; also, they  lose  all  dexterity
bonuses. The chance for vertigo is checked each round.

Veschiul's  shadowbolt allows the wizard to mould a bolt of shadow  from  the
plane of shadow, and fire it up to 120 feet range. A to-hit roll is required,
but  is  made as a fighter at a level of 1« times the wizard's level, rounded
up. The shadowbolt does damage by impact: at ranges under 40 feet, the damage
taken  is  1d4 points per level, at ranges between 40 feet and  80  feet  the
damage taken is 1d4 points per 2 levels, and at greater ranges the damage  is
1d4  points  per 4 levels. The number of dice should be rounded down  in  all
cases  (thus, a 5th-level wizard at 50 feet does 2d4 points of damage, but  a
6th-level  wizard  does 3d4). The creature must make  a  Dexterity  check  to
remain  standing, adjusted by a -1 for every two levels of the wizard (again,
rounded down), as well as by mass:

          Dexterity
     Mass (pounds)  Adjustment     Distance
     1-30 -8   25 feet
     31-60     -6   20 feet
     61-90     -4   15 feet
     91-120    -3   10 feet
     121-150   -2   5 feet
     151-180   -1   -
     181-210   0    -
     211-240   +1   -
     241-270   +2   -
     271-300   +3   -
     300+ +4   -

The  distance column indicates how far the target has been knocked away  from
the wizard if a modified Dexterity check was failed.

The  shadowcurse can affect any creature of the world of light. The  area  of
effect is one creature for every two levels of the wizard above first;  i.e.,
a  3rd-level wizard can affect one creature, a fifth can affect two,  and  so
on.  The effect of the shadowcurse is to afflict the victims with some of the
vulnerabilities  of a shade. The effects depend on the light  conditions,  as
shown on the following table:

     Light     Abilities Move Max. HP
     Bright    -2   «    «
     Average   -1   _    _
     Twilight  -    -    -

     Darkness  -1   _    _

This  spell  makes an object vibrate rapidly. Intelligent objects get  saving
throw  versus spell. A vibrating object (for example, a sword) becomes almost
impossible to hold: there is a 15% per level chance to fumble the object each
round, else there is a -1 to-hit. Objects with a mass of 1 pound per level or
less  must  make  a saving throw versus spell or disintegrate.  The  material
component is a rattlesnake's tail.

The  creature  upon whom this spell is cast is empowered to  make  any  touch
attacks  from  spells cast by the wizard during the duration of  this  spell.
Note  that the wizard loses the ability to make such attacks, and spells such
as vampiric touch confer their benefits on the person who delivers the touch,
not  upon  the caster. The caster must prepare the recipient of  a  vicarious
touch  spell  for 10 minutes prior to casting the spell, but this preparation
can take place up to 24 hours before the spell is cast.

The material components of this spell are pure water and a specially prepared
oil used to wash and anoint the hand of the recipient.

This  spell  can  only be cast by druids. When they cast it, they  receive  a
mental image of their guarded lands. They instantly gain a rough knowledge of
what  is happening there: what type of creatures inhabit there, if there  are
any  newcomers and if there has been any damage to the lands (a dead tree  or
two is nothing serious, while someone cutting down trees to build a house  is
certain to be noticed).
The  spell  gives  no specific information, such as names or  images  of  any
involved  persons.  Some examples of specific information follow;  the  exact
location of the events is always specified.
          Three persons, aided by two large animals, cut down trees.
           Someone  has cast a spell the previous day; he did not defile  the
land.
           A  party  of  adventurers has camped in the lands, but  they  seem
harmless.
          There has been a disturbance; animals seem to be anxious.
The  material  component is any amount of elemental material, appropriate  to
the  nature of the lands: A rock, a water pool, a fire or plain air. This  is
not consumed in the casting.
The  caster must be on the same plane of existence with his guarded land  for
the spell to work.
This  spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign  world.  The  spell  was
created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

When  this spell is cast on an area, it allows the wizard to create a  three-
dimensional image of the past in that location. The wizard specifies the time
in the past through the use of the material component.
Ten  gold  pieces worth of gold dust is required for each hour back into  the
past  the wizard wishes to go. Thus, if the wizard used 240 gp worth of dust,
he  would be able to view the period starting 24 hours ago to the end of  the
duration  of  the  spell (for example, if the wizard were  tenth  level,  the
duration of the spell would be from 24 hours in the past to 22 hours  and  20
minutes into the past).
After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 2d10-11 to determine the error in
the  time frame in turns from the specified time. Thus, if N gp are used, and
the  DM  rolls 5-10 = -5, the starting point of the time viewed  is  actually
10xN  hours  and  5 minutes in the past; a roll of 10 indicates  exactly  the
right amount of gold was consumed.
The  wizard should roll 1d20 to determine the clarity of the casting.  A  die
roll of one indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a fog. A die
roll  of  20 indicates a crystal clear picture. This roll can be repeated  in
subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty in seeing through time.
Both the following dice rolls can be modified by the wizards desire based  on
the following modifiers:

Wizard... Modifier
participated in the event     +10
very well informed of the event    +6
knows an exact quote during the event   +4
knows something that was said at the time    +2

Events that are cloaked by spells that hide themselves from clairvoyance also
mask out view past, and thus cannot be seen by this spell.

Vindicator's  quest  is  similar  to the  5th-level  quest  spell,  with  the
following differences: vindicator's quest is cast upon oneself. Following the
casting, however, every person that the priest comes in contact with is  also
subject  to the quest. The priest need only explain the quest, argue for  its
moral correctness, and whoever listens to the story must save versus spell or
be drawn into the quest. Creatures of the priest's religion are not allowed a
saving  throw (provided the priest is clearly recognisable as being of  their
common faith), and creatures of the priest's alignment save at  4. The  spell
has  no  effect on creatures whose alignment differs from that of the  priest
with respect to good and evil.
All creatures subject to the quest spell are unable to do anything but follow
the  leader of the quest. Failure to follow the priest will result  in  a   1
penalty applied to saving throws for each day that the quest is ignored.  The
priest  casting the spell himself can never ignore the quest, and is  single-
mindedly  devoted to its completion. A higher level priest  of  the  priest's
religion can remove the quest, as can some artifacts and relics.
Vindicator's quest has the requirement that the nature of the quest be one of
vengeance. The priest must be certain of the moral correctness of the  quest,
and it must be looked on favourably by the priest's deity.
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.

     This cantrip allows the wizard to see things in the distance up to three
times better for the duration of this spell. It also allows him to see things
more  clearly  as they appear to be only one third of the distance  away.  It
does,  however, cause some problems when trying to see things  close-up.  The
spell's duration may be ended at any time.

This  spell  allows the caster to reach into the victim's mind and  find  his
worst  fear. The target of the spell thinks that the vision is real and  dies
of  fright, unless a saving throw versus death magic is made. A second saving
throw  must be made to determine if the victim thinks the vision is  real  or
not. If he does think it's real, he runs away in terror for 1d6 rounds. If he
doesn't, he sees that the vision is fake and he isn't harmed in any way. Note
that  the victim must be intelligent: unintelligent creatures, such  as  most
undead, are not affected by this spell. The material component for this spell
is a lens.

By  means of this spell, the caster is able to mimic the voices and sounds of
others.  This automatically allows him to duplicate any accent he has  heard.
Thus,  an  orcish  accent  or one from a far off country  could  be  mimicked
convincingly.  Animal sounds can also bemimicked, though druids  and  rangers
may  save versus spell to uncover the ruse. The volume of the mimicked  voice
can range anywhere from a whisper to a shout.
The spell can also be used to mimic a specific individuals voice, though this
allows  those hearing the voice a saving throw versus spell, modified by  the
following table. These modifiers are cumulative.

Caster... Modifier
has heard voice once     +4
has heard voice occasionally  +2
has heard voice often    +0
studied desired voice    -2
looks approximately like the mimicked person -2
looks exactly like the mimicked person  -4
looks radically different from mimicked person    +6

Victim...      Modifier
has heard voice once     -2
has heard voice occasionally  +0
has heard voice often    +2

The  caster can attempt to mimic one voice or animal for every two levels  he
possesses  per  casting  of  the spell. Once voice  mimicry  has  been  cast,
concentration  is  not  required to maintain it and  the  caster  may  switch
between available voices (including his own) as he wills.
The  caster cannot duplicate sounds he himself has not heard. The effects  of
ventriloquism can also be created by the spell so that the mimicked voice can
be  made  to come from another source. Using the spell in this manner reduces
the number of available voices to one half (one per four levels).
This spell is particularity effective if the caster is disguised to look like
the  person  he  is  mimicking. It can very effective for  causing  political
problems.

By  the  means  of  this spell, the wizard causes his body and  equipment  to
become  effectively a sphere of annihilation. Anything that comes in  contact
with  his  body,  will be utterly and irrevocably destroyed.  Anyone  foolish
enough  to attack the caster, will lose his weapon on a successful  hit  (the
caster  takes no damage). If the weapon is a claw, it means the  loss  of  an
arm,  if  it's  a bite - loss of a head. The one drawback of  the  spell  is,
however, that the caster becomes himself totally "wrapped" in the darkness of
the  void - he cannot see or feel anything (not even by clairvoyance). He can
still  walk,  jump, run, etc., but he would know the results of  his  actions
only  when the spell ends. The caster is aware of the passage of time.  While
in  void form, the caster takes no physical damage, not from weapons and  not
damaging spells.
The  caster  does  not make a saving throw, but any magical  object  makes  a
saving throw versus crushing blow. Living creatures are not affected.

The material component of the spell is any object brought from the Abyss.

When  cast  on an edged weapon, the weapon will become vorpal upon  its  next
use,  and  will remain that way for 1 round per 3 levels of the  wizard.  The
weapon may not be magical, except if subject to an enchantment spell.
The  spell  adds no plusses to the weapon, but plusses due to quality  or  an
enchantment  spell  do  apply.  The material component  is  a  mithril  razor
enchanted to +6 with an enchantment spell and a sharpness spell costing  1000
gp. The spell can be made permanent, but to do so requires a specially forged
weapon, and a miniature version of the weapon forged from the same metals  in
lieu of the razor. The total cost starts at 50,000 gp.

A  voyeur is a person who derives sexual gratification from observing other's
sex  organs, especially in secret. Thus, this spell allows the wizard to  see
through  a  person's  clothing  and examine  sexual  organs.  Of  course  the
gratification  part  must  be achieved solely by  the  wizard.  The  material
component of the spell is a small piece of cloth and a small piece of glass.

Upon  casting this spell, a vertical column of condensed air crashed down  in

This spell enables a priest to concentrate the air around him into a powerful
gust  of  wind, 4 yards across. The priest chooses the target of the airbolt,
which  must be a single creature within range. The airbolt will automatically
hit  its target as long as the priest can see the creature it is supposed  to
hit.  The airbolt delivers 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster (10d4
is  the maximum). The target is allowed a saving throw versus spell for  half
damage.  If the saving throw is failed, the creature will also drop  whatever
it was carrying in its hands or paws.
The  material  component  needed for this spell is a short  (1-foot)  crystal
blowpipe  worth at least 1000 gp. The priest uses this blowpipe to focus  the
airbolt.  Every time the blowpipe is used it has to make a successful  saving
throw  versus crushing blow to avoid bursting. If the blowpipe remains whole,
it can be reused later.

By  casting this spell, a priest is granted the ability to create for himself
a  mansion made of clouds. But before he can cast this spell, he first has to
choose  a  suitable  cloud. Then he has to bless it by  casting  these  three
spells  on it: bless, dispel evil and true seeing, and by sprinkling it  with
holy  water.  From  the next morning onwards he has to observe  a  period  of
fasting  of  six  consecutive days during which he  prays  on  the  cloud  in
question. When that is finished he still has to ask for the personal approval
of  his  deity  (through commune) and of Nature itself (through commune  with
nature).
Only  if  both  approve of his undertaking can the priest  proceed  with  his
undertaking: again he has to bless the cloud and spray holy water on it. Then
he must throw powdered gems over it (the gems should have been worth at least
8000  gp). The cloud will have become semi-solid by this time, and the priest
now  has  to  build a small shrine for his deity with his bare hands,  taking
building block from the cloud itself (the shrine will always be at the centre
of  the final mansion). When the shrine has been completed, the priest has to
commune with his deity one final time in order to seek its permission. If  at
that  time  the  deity has an urgent mission to be fulfilled by  one  of  its
followers, the priest will first have to take care of that.
If  all has gone fine, the priest can begin his real work: he has to meditate
with  the  help  of  a piece of incense of meditation (the  spell's  material
component) and then he can cast this spell: Vylja's airy abode. While casting
this  spell   a process that takes one turn and that has to be performed with
closed  eyes   the priest has to imagine how he wants the area of  effect  to
look,  and  the cloud will take that exact shape. When the spell is finished,
the  priest can open his eyes again. However, he must also make saving  throw
versus  death magic. If the priest is unsuccessful, the spell fails,  forcing
the  priest to begin the process all over again. If, on the other  hand,  the
saving throw is made, the priest now has a mansion in the sky. Its colour  is
that of the gems used earlier in the creation process. Gardens, trees, hills,
buildings,  lakes, waterfalls, fountains and the like will all be present  as
the  priest has imagined them; furniture, curtains and similar items have  to
be provided by the priest himself. It is only at this stage that other beings
are  allowed to walk on the cloud (if this happens earlier, the whole process
is automatically ruined).
The  airy abode is under the mental control of the priest who created it:  it
is not affected by natural winds unless the priest wants it to, and by a mere
act  of  will he can cause it to ascend or descend. Lateral movement  can  be
accomplished through the use of spells like control winds, summon weather and
control weather. The priest can also cause a rainbow bridge (see the spell of
that name, but the length of the bridge can be 10 yards per level, and it can
last  1  turn  per level) to take shape whenever he wants to,  thus  enabling
ground  based creatures to reach his abode quite easily. The cloud will  also
not  dissipate any more due to natural, climatological changes, and the water
supply for the lake and the plants will never dry up.
A  priest can only have one airy abode at a time, although different  priests
can  for a time connect their abodes to form a larger one. An airy abode  can
only  be  affected by its caster (once it exists, he can recast the spell  to
change parts of it), by creatures with more Hit Dice than the caster, and  by
deities  of  all powers. However, the abode can only be utterly destroyed  by
the  casting  of  a  full wish with exactly that purpose, by  putrefying  the
shrine  and  then disintegrating at least 10% of the cloud, or by  convincing
the  priest's deity that it should no longer approve of the airy abode  (note
that  the priest's deity is as free to make changes to the cloud or move  it,
as  is  the  priest  himself). In all these cases the  cloud  will  begin  to
dissipate. The airy abode will fully fall apart 1 turn later. If at any  time
a  priest's  airy  abode  is being tampered with, the priest  will  instantly
become aware of this, even when he is on another plane.
As has been mentioned already, a piece of incense of meditation is needed for
this spell, as if, of course, one cloud of the right size.

When  this spell is cast, a creature is summoned from the elemental plane  of
air  to  serve the caster. It is humanoid in shape and approximately 10  feet
high.  The  caster is able to order it around for 3 rounds per level  he  has
attained (but see below). After this time, the airy assistant returns to  its
native plane.
The  creature  has  low  Intelligence  and  cannot  speak.  However,  it  can
understand the verbal commands of its caster as long as these are kept fairly
simple  ("Attack them!" or "Guard this door!", for example). The  priest  can
change  the airy assistant's task as often as he deems necessary.  These  are
its statistics:

     Airy Assistant.

     10 HD; 45 HP; AC 3.
     MV 6, fl. 18 (C); THAC0 11.
     Number of Attacks 1; Damage 1d10+7 (19 Strength).
     Intelligence: Low (2 4).
     Alignment: Lawful Neutral.
     Size: L (10 feet high).
     Morale: 20.
     XP Value: 1500.

Its  Strength  score also determines its weight allowance and its  chance  to
open doors and bend bars.
An airy assistant is not in fact under the control of the priest who summoned
it    it will obey the creature that possesses the holy symbol that was  used
for  summoning  it.  So  if the priest's holy symbol is  taken  from  him  by
someone,  the  control over the airy assistance for the rest of the  duration
passes  to  that person. If the holy symbol is destroyed, the airy  assistant
immediately returns to its own plane of existence. An airy assistant  can  be
physically destroyed, and it can also be forced back to its home plane  by  a
successful  dispel  magic, abjure or banishment. Dismiss air  elemental  (the
reversal of conjure air elemental) also works. A protection from evil or good
spell will keep the airy assistant at a distance.
The material component for this spell is the caster's holy symbol.

Casting  this  spell will only work under the open sky at night.  It  invokes
extremely  colourful and beautiful northern lights that slowly swirl  through
the entire sky. The aurora is visible to all creatures in the area of effect,
even  to  those  that  are  looking outside through a  window.  All  affected
creatures  have  to roll a saving throw versus spell in order  to  avoid  the
charming effects of the spell. The following modifiers apply:

           4 on a moonless night         4 if there is a real aurora
           2 for a quarter of the moon        2 at midnight
          +2 for three quarters         +2 at dusk or dawn
          +4 for a full moon

The  normal  Wisdom  modifiers  against charming  spells  also  apply.  Those
creatures  that fail their saving throws are fascinated by the  spectacle  in
the  sky  and will continue looking at it for the full duration of the  spell
possibly resulting in strained necks. A physical attack on a charmed creature
cancels  the charm immediately for that creature. If a lot of noise  is  made
(by alarm-bells or shouting, for example) a new saving throw is granted at +4
for   all  the  creatures  affected  by  the  spell.  Those  creatures   that
successfully  save  versus spell are free to look at the northern  lights  if
they want to, but are in no way charmed.
The  priest  casting  aurora borealis is always immune to  his  own  northern
lights. He needs his holy symbol to cast the spell.

Upon  casting this spell one or more flying balls of lightning appear  before
the  priest. Their diameter depends on their electrical charge: 4 inches  for
each  1d6 worth of damage (a ball with a diameter of one foot will cause  3d6
points  of damage), but no single ball lightning can be larger than 40 inches
at  the  time of casting (but see below). The caster can cause 1d6 of  damage
for each level he has attained.
When  the priest has cast ball lightning he points at the target creature  or
creatures. The balls teleport to their destinations if they are within range,
but  disappear  otherwise. No more than one ball can  be  sent  to  a  single
creature.  If a ball lightning reaches its target, it starts to swirl  around
it  extremely rapidly, coming as close as 1 foot but never actually  touching
the  target. If the creature does not move, the ball disappears with a  small
but harmless implosion at the end of the duration, which is 1 round per level
of the priest casting the spell.
If,  however,  the  target creature tries to move, he inevitably  comes  into
contact  with the ball lightning which then explodes. The creature is allowed
a  saving throw versus spell for half damage. If the target creature wants to
cast  a  spell  with  a somatic component it first has to make  a  successful
Dexterity check in order to avoid coming into contact with the ball lightning
unintentionally. If another creature than the one targeted tries to pass  the
swirling ball lightning containing the target, the ball will explode  in  its
face,  causing the appropriate amount of damage (1d6 HP), unless a successful
saving  throw for half damage is made. The target creature is not  harmed  by
such an explosion.
When  a spell based on electricity is cast at a creature contained in a  ball
lightning, it is absorbed into the ball. For each 1d6 HP of damage the  spell
would  have  inflicted  on the contained creature, the ball  lightning  grows
another  4  inches  and increases its charge. It does not  touch  the  target
however,  even  if becomes more than 40 inches in diameter. If  the  creature
inside  the  ball  lightning casts an electricity  based  spell  it  is  also
absorbed with similar effects.
The spell cannot be used against flying or rapidly moving targets (moving  at
MV  12 or more), as the lightning ball fails to take form in such cases.  The
material component is a rock crystal with a value of at least 200 gp.
The  spell can be used to immobilize one or more creatures, or to protect the
party from an angry crowd or the breath weapon of a blue dragon.

This  spell  enables the priest to write a message into a cloud  so  that  it
becomes visible to all creatures who can see the cloud. The caster summons  a
small  (1  HD) air elemental from the elemental plane of air, points  at  the
cloud he wants to use and then writes the message into the air. The elemental
then  flies to the cloud and changes its shape until it is an exact  copy  of
the original message magnified many times. The handwriting of the caster will
even be recognised by all that are familiar with it.
The message will be visible during the day and the night as long as there  is
at least one major celestial body in the sky that can shine through the holes
made in the cloud. The cloud is magically protected for the duration for  the
spell  and  it  will  not  lose any vapour during  this  time,  even  if  the
surrounding  clouds  disappear into rain (the elemental  is  taking  care  of
this).  What's  more,  the priest can influence the direction  the  cloud  is
moving:  he  can cause it to stay immobile, or he can choose a direction  the
cloud has to travel to (at about 2 miles per hour). But once this choice  has
been made it cannot be changed and will remain the same for the full duration
of the spell   1 day per level of the caster. At the end of the duration, the
elemental returns to its native plane.

This  spell  transforms the caster's body into one that has  the  height  (24
feet)  and Strength (23) of a cloud giant. The caster's face will also change
somewhat, so that only creatures well known to the priest will recognize  him
in  his  new  shape. Other creatures will likely consider him a  true  giant,
although  real giants and Titans are never fooled by the spell. Note  however
that  the  priest's skin colour will not change in the least: a dark  elf  in
cloud shape still appears as black as the night.
The  advantages of the spell are solely on the physical level: his skin turns
as  hard  as  that of a real cloud giant, granting him an Armour Class  of  0
(Dexterity, defensive spells, and armour of cloud giant size can improve this
Armour  Class further); his Strength becomes 23, granting him a +5  bonus  on
his  to-hit rolls and 11 points of additional damage on each physical  attack
(open  doors  checks  will succeed on rolls of 18 or  less  (16  for  magical
doors); bend bars and lift gates checks have a 90% chance of success).  Also,
the  priest gains 1d6 HP for as long as the spell lasts. Finally, the  priest
can also understand and speak the tongue of cloud giants.
Vylja's cloud shape also has some major disadvantages: as long as the  priest
assumes  this  shape,  he  can only cast spells of first  and  second  level.
Exceptions  to  this  rule  are  granted powers  (including  spells),  innate
abilities  (like  the spells drow can cast), and of course  spells  that  are
stored  in items. The second disadvantage is that only the caster's non-magic
items  will partake in the transformation, effectively rendering most of  his
magic  items  absolutely useless for the duration of the spell. Magic  rings,
cloaks,  gauntlets, boots, necklaces, bracers, armour (and  other  pieces  of
clothing) have to be removed prior to the casting of this spell or they  will
be utterly destroyed.
The  spell normally lasts for 2 rounds per level of the caster. However,  the
caster can at any time decide to change back to his natural shape (note  that
this  change  is  definitive   no shape swapping  is  possible).  The  caster
regains  1d10 points of damage when he does so. If a successful dispel  magic
forces  the  caster to transform back to his normal shape, he does  not  gain
these hit points. Should the priest die while in cloud shape, he is instantly
transformed to his normal form.
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell.

After  casting this spell the priest can enable 1 creature for every 3 levels
he has attained to walk on clouds, thick fog, dense smoke and the like (if it
is visible, it can be walked upon) for 1 hour per level he has. The creatures
can jump on the cloud, dig into it, and even cut pieces from it.
Cloud  walk however does not grant the creatures the capacity to get  on  the
cloud: if it is high in the air, they will have to use other magic (fly,  air
walk,  etc.)  to reach it; if it is rolling along the surface of  the  earth,
they  can  try  to  climb it. The cloud will always continue  moving  in  the
direction  it  was  already  going unless other  magic  (control  winds,  for
example) is used. Should the cloud begin to dissipate, the affected creatures
will  hear  creaking noises from underneath, so that they can start  thinking
about getting off the cloud.
The  spell  can be used to carry creatures into safety, as a cheap  means  of
transport  (just  hop onto a fast-moving cloud that is  going  in  the  right
direction), or as a way to approach an enemy base without being noticed.
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell and a handful of water.

By  casting  this spell, the caster can protect the eyes of any one  creature
against  the  blinding  effects  of  normal  sunlight  and  the  like.  As  a
consequence, this spell is only useful for creatures that normally reside  in
the  Underdark and similar dimly lit places. When their eyes are shielded  by
Vylja's dark eyes, creatures like drow and duergar can roam the surface world
during daylight without suffering penalties (see the Monstrous Compendia  for
details). If the target creature is unwilling to receive this protection,  it
is granted a saving throw versus spell to avoid the effects.
The  spell has one disadvantage: because it makes the eyes of these creatures
less sensitive, their range of infravision is halved for the duration of  the
spell.  Vylja's dark eyes lasts for one turn per level of the priest  casting
the  spell, or until dispelled by a dispel magic. If a light is directly cast
at  the  protected creature and it fails its saving throw against that spell,
the two spells dispel each other. When a continual light is cast in a similar
way,  and the creature fails its saving throw, Vylja's dark eyes is dispelled
in  other  words: the creature will immediately suffer maximum penalties  for
being  in  a brightly lit area. If the protected creature successfully  saves
against  a light or continual light cast at it, it will stand in its area  of
effect,  but it will suffer no adverse effects. The caster can also  end  the
spell  at  will,  although the eyes will need three rounds  to  regain  their
normal sensitivity.
The  material component for Vylja's dark eyes is an ointment that can be made
by  any character with the herbalism proficiency. It needs precious herbs (20
gp  per dose) that must be collected either at dawn or at dusk, and that must
be  dried  for at least one month before they can be made into the  ointment.
This  final process takes one full day of careful mixing (5 doses can be made
on a single day). Once the ointment is ready, it can be kept for one month if
put in an airtight and dark container. During casting such a dose is then put
on the eyelids of the protected creature.

Except  as noted above, this spell is in almost all respects similar  to  the
1st-level  spell Vylja's dark eyes. The one difference is that  Vylja's  dark
vision  will never be dispelled by a light spell, and that a continual  light
will  itself also be dispelled when the protected creature fails  its  saving
throw against that spell.

When  a priest casts Vylja's drow alarm, he creates a magical dweomer in  the
area  of  effect which is tuned to the radiation given off by some  creatures
and  objects of the Underdark, especially dark elves. If the dweomer  detects
such  radiation  in  the area of effect, it triggers  an  alarm  (either  the
booming sound of alarm-bells which can be heard up to 1 mile away, or a  loud
beep  in  the  caster's head   the caster determines which  at  the  time  of
casting). If no such radiation is detected, the spell expires after one  hour
per level of the caster.
The  area  of effect is sphere with a radius of 30 feet, and it is stationary
for  the full duration of the spell. The dweomer only reacts to the radiation
that  is  given  off in certain places in the Underdark.  As  drow  use  this
radiation  to  craft their special gear, and as they need it to  power  their
innate abilities, it is highly unlikely that evil drow will attack the caster
without  these advantages. Drow that enter the area of effect are allowed  to
roll  for  their  magical resistance and then to roll a saving  throw  versus
spell  to  avoid  triggering  the alarm; their items,  however,  are  allowed
neither and will thus automatically trigger the alarm. Note further that  any
item  that  gives  off such radiation, even when carried by a  non-drow  will
trigger the spell.
The  material component needed for this spell is some dust that was subjected
to the Underdark radiation. It is consumed by the spell.

When Vylja's energy shield is cast, the protected creature is surrounded by a
glimmering and crackling blue cloak of magic. The energy shield lasts  for  5
rounds for each level of the caster, unless it is exhausted earlier.
The  energy shield will absorb attacks based on pure magical energy that  are
directed  against the creature it protects. It absorbs one magic missile  for
each  level  the  caster has attained (a magic missile cast  by  a  9th-level
wizard  will  take five charges off the energy shield). At the  end  of  each
round during which the energy shield has absorbed at least one magic missile,
there is a chance of 1% per level of the caster of the magic missile that the
energy  shield implodes, causing the protected creature to suffer 1d4  points
of magical energy damage for each charge it has left.
Vylja's energy shield also protects against spellfire attacks: it absorbs its
caster's  level Hit Dice of damage before becoming exhausted. The  chance  of
the  energy shield imploding rises to 2% per level of the spellfire  wielder.
This 2% is cumulative with the 1% mentioned above.
When a creature protected by Vylja's energy shield comes into contact with  a
wall  of  force, the energy shield automatically implodes. There  is  however
also  a 3% chance per level of the caster of the energy shield that the  wall
of force will also be dispelled.
Because  magical  attacks  based on fire, electricity  and  cold  are  partly
supported  by  pure magical energy, a creature protected by an energy  shield
has  a  bonus of +2 on its saving throws against such spells. This  does  not
exhaust the energy shield in any way, and such spells cannot cause the energy
shield to implode.
In order to cast Vylja's energy shield, a priest needs his holy symbol and  a
sapphire worth at least 1000 gp.

This  defensive spell creates a whirling mass of air around a  central  point
(the caster) which remains undisturbed: the eye of the cyclone. The eye is 10
feet in diameter, whereas the barrier which surrounds it is 15 feet thick  at
all  sides. The wind speed in the barrier is about 6 miles for each level the
caster  has  attained. Any creature trying to pass through the  barrier  will
suffer  1d4  points of damage per caster level due to wind blasts and  flying
debris.  No normal movement of air (or something as weak as a gust  of  wind)
can  penetrate  the  cyclone, nor can creatures in  gaseous  form  or  flying
creatures  that are medium sized or smaller. All these creatures will  suffer
normal  damage but have no chance of actually making it to the centre    they
are  expelled at the outside of the cyclone. Large flying creature will  also
suffer  damage  but have the usual chance of reaching the eye:  they,  as  do
walking  creatures, have to roll a successful Constitution  check.  Creatures
that  fail  this  check  are driven to the outside  again,  after  they  have
suffered damage.
Those  creatures  that  are  standing in the eye can  see  nothing  of  their
surroundings, but are free to cast spells or move about in the eye.  If  they
step into the cyclone they suffer normal damage. However, they do not have to
make  a  Constitution check to get outside the barrier (but they do  if  they
want to return to the eye).
The  caster can make the cyclone end early, but it will still take two rounds
to disappear altogether: during the first round damage drops to 1d3 per level
of  the  caster, and in the second round all creatures trying  to  cross  the
barrier suffer 1 point of damage per caster level. A dispel magic will  cause
the  cyclone to dissipate in the same way as if the caster had wished to  end
the spell early. Control wind can influence the wind speed in the cyclone and
the damage it inflicts.
This spell can be cast both outdoors (the cyclone will attain a height of  60
feet)  and  indoors  (the cyclone will grow to the ceiling,  unless  that  is
higher than 60 feet).

Because it simulates one of her innate abilities, this spell is normally only
granted  by  'rdrie F`nya, the elven goddess of weather and flying creatures.
By  casting  Vylja's flight cancellation a priest can make it impossible  for
any one creature to lift itself into the air by physical or magical means.  A
saving  throw  versus paralysation is always allowed if the target  wants  to
avoid the spell's effects.
If  the saving throw is failed, the creature will not be able to get off  the
ground itself: all its attempts to jump, rise or fly will simply fail for  as
long as the spell lasts. Neither wings, nor spells, nor innate abilities, nor
magical  items  will work for the target creature. If a flying or  levitating
creature is affected by this spell, it will instantly plummet to the  ground,
taking normal falling damage (except for winged creatures, which can glide to
the  ground for half damage). As soon as the spell expires, the creature  can
again leave the surface if it is able to do so. Note that spells like fly  or
levitate  are not dispelled by Vylja's flight cancellation   they  simply  do
not work while the flight cancellation is active (although their duration  is
calculated as normal).
A creature affected by this spell can still be lifted off the ground by other
creatures.  Spells like teleport, feather fall, and dimension  door  function
normally (but jump is negated).
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell.

This  spell  protects the priest who casts it from all sorts of  natural  and
magical  attacks based on fire, cold, acid, gas, and electricity.  The  spell
lasts  for five rounds per level of the caster or until its protective energy
has been exhausted, whatever occurs first.
As  long as the spell lasts the priest is fully immune to all natural attacks
based on those five sources. Magical attacks will be absorbed until they have
dealt  5 points of damage per level of the priest casting the spell (see  the
various  protection from ... spells to see what is considered  "natural"  and
what  "magical").  The priest needs his holy symbol in  order  to  cast  this
spell.
An  example: a 15th-level priest casts greater protection on himself when  he
enters  the hide-out of an evil wizard. The wizard surprises him and casts  a
lightning  bolt: the priest fails his saving throw but does  not  suffer  the
slightest  effect  from  the lightning bolt: the  32  points  of  damage  are
absorbed by greater protection. The following round the wizard casts  a  cone
of  cold:  its 36 points of damage are absorbed as well. At that  moment  the
priest still has 7 points of protection left.

In the round following the casting of this spell, a hailstorm breaks loose in
the  area of effect, if and only if the spell is not cast in a desert or near
the  crater of an active volcano or the like. As long as there is  a  minimal
amount  of moisture in the air, it will be compacted to form hailstones  that
inflict  2d4  points of damage + 1 point per level of the priest casting  the
spell.  All creatures are allowed saving throws versus spell for half damage.
Those wearing plate mail, field plate or full plate suffer no damage at  all,
although their armour will be dented. If it is snowing or raining at the time
of  casting the amount of damage inflicted is 3d4 points of damage  +  1  per
level  of  the priest; and if it is actually hailing in the area  of  effect,
damage is doubled to 4d4 points + 2 per level of the priest.
The  priest  needs  his holy symbol to cast this spell, and  either  a  small
spherical  piece  of  ice or a diamond worth at least 100  gp.  The  material
component  (not the holy symbol) is to be thrown into the air at the  end  of
the casting time where it disappears.

When  this  spell is cast, the priest's hands start to give off a soft  white
glow. The glow indicates the presence of healing magic, which the caster  can
use  to  cure the wounds of other creatures than himself (for creatures  that
are  unaffected  by  this spell, see cure light wounds). The  healing  charge
rises with the caster's level: each hand can cure 1 point of damage for  each
experience level of the priest.
A  hand's  healing  charge must be used up all at once on a single  creature.
Moreover,  a single creature will not benefit from the charges of both  hands
(consider  the  second charge lost in such a case). The benefits  of  Vylja's
hands  of  healing are cumulative with those of the various cure  ...  wounds
spells.
A priest can spend the two healing charges in a single round, provided he can
touch  the  creatures he wants to heal. He can also keep the charges  in  his
hands  for up to 1 hour for each experience level he has. In the latter case,
he  is  not allowed to attack other creatures physically or magically  if  he
desires  to  retain  the  healing charges. If he does attack,  the  remaining
charges disappear instantly.
The material component is the caster's holy symbol.

By  casting  this  spell,  a priest can focus the natural  electrical  energy
present  in  his surroundings into a bolt of lightning. The spell  has  three
different applications.
           It  can function as a faster way of casting call lightning. Except
for  the shorter duration, it is identical to that spell (it can only be cast
outdoors when a storm is near, for example).
           The  second application of Vylja's lightning strike can still only
be  cast outdoors, but it needs no real storm to power it. However, it can be
cast  in any given site with a 1 mile diameter only once every hour (this  is
the  time  it  takes  for  the  natural charges  to  build  up  again).  This
application  delivers  1d4 points of electricity  damage  to  its  target  or
targets for each level the priest has attained. The area of effect is  up  to
the  caster: it can be a circle with a diameter of 20 feet, or the priest can
choose  to  let  the lightning strike up to three different creatures  within
range.  In  the  latter case, the electrical charge must be  divided  by  the
priest over the different targets (for example, a 16th-level priest could hit
a  giant for 10d4 points of damage, and its two gnoll servants for 3d4 points
each). A saving throw versus spell is allowed for half damage.
           The third application closely resembles the second one, but it can
also be cast indoors or under the ground. The damage is however decreased  to
1d3 points of damage per caster level. The saving throw for half damage is of
course still applicable.

By  casting open clouds a priest can create an opening in an otherwise closed
cloud-cover, so that he and other creatures in the area of effect can benefit
from  direct sunlight or, at night, moonlight and starlight. The spell  lasts
for  1  round per level of the priest casting the spell, and will  only  work
outdoors.
The  illuminated sphere remains stationary unless the priest who has cast the
spell  concentrates  on its movement   the level of concentration  needed  to
achieve this makes it impossible for him to cast other spells or to engage in
melee.
The  reversed spell, create cloud (Conjuration), conjures forth a small cloud
in  the  sky that blocks all direct light from one major celestial body.  The
magical  cloud  can be moved in the same way as the opening  created  by  the
normal spell.
The material component for both spells is the priest's holy symbol.

By  casting this spell, a priest is granted the power to freely move  through
the  skies in whatever way he sees fit: he can levitate, fly, run, walk, etc.
(running  checks  for  a  skywalking creature are  somewhat  easier,  due  to
decreased resistance: all Strength and Constitution checks have a +2  bonus).
A  priest can instantly change his mode of movement for as long as the  spell
lasts.
When  levitating, a priest can lift up to 100 pounds per level of  experience
into  the  air. Once the weight is off the ground, he can move it  around  by
flying  or  walking to another location. A flying priest has  manoeuvrability
class A, and he can fly around at MV 18. As a consequence, running characters
can  go  a  lot faster than those that fly. When flying, a priest can  easily
transport  his own weight plus 10 pounds for every experience  level  he  has
attained. For every 50 pounds above that amount, his movement rate  for  that
round  is  decreased by 1 (down to a minimum movement rate of 1, not  lower).
Note further that a skywalking priest can never lose his balance in the way a
levitating creature can. Strong winds, however, can cause a skywalking priest
to move with difficulty.
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell.

#9#
Vylja's  spiders  to  ashes is an improved version  of  the  3rd-level  spell
Vylja's  webs  to dust. The casting of the spell creates a golden  glow  that
fills  the  area  of  effect for about 10 seconds. This  light  automatically
destroys  all natural and magical webs within its confines: they  are  turned
into  harmless dust. Spiders and objects that were supported by the webs fall
to the surface and suffer normal falling damage.
Moreover, Vylja's spiders to ashes also causes damage to creatures  that  are
wholly  or partly arachnoid (driders and steeders, for example) and to living
webs. All such creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per experience level  of
the  caster. They are however allowed a saving throw versus death  magic  for
half damage.
This  spell  can  also  help against a creeping doom, because  such  a  swarm
normally consists at least partly of arachnids. Vylja's spiders to ashes will
destroy between 100 and 500 of the critters (1d5 100).
The  material components needed for this spell are the caster's  holy  symbol
and a precious stone worth at least 50 gp. The stone must have been enchanted
with continual light prior to the casting of this spell. It disappears during
casting.

Upon casting this spell the creature touched by the priest is covered on  all
sides  by a translucent armour of dense air and wind, approximately 3  inches
thick. This air current absorbs the damage inflicted by weapons of all  kinds
and effectively grants the protected creature an Armour Class of 1. The storm
armour can be combined with magical devices like a ring of protection. If the
creature touched already has an Armour Class of 2 or better, the storm armour
will improve it by two places (from AC  3 to AC  5, for example).
A  storm armour also grants full protection against natural and magical gusts
of wind, so that the creature protected can walk through hurricane like winds
without suffering ill effects (the creature can still be hit by flying debris
of course).
Other  creatures  can  deduce the presence of a  storm  armour,  because  the
protected creature's hairs and clothing will be moving as if blown upon by  a
soft breeze. The material component is the priest's holy symbol with which he
has to touch the creature to be affected.

This  spell  transforms the caster's body into one that has  the  height  (26
feet)  and Strength (24) of a storm giant. The caster's face will also change
somewhat, so that only creatures well known to the priest will recognize  him
in  his  new  shape. Other creatures will likely consider him a  true  giant,
although  real giants and Titans are never fooled by the spell. Note  however
that the priest skin colour will not change in the least: a dark elf in storm
shape still appears as black as the night.
The  advantages of the spell are solely on the physical level: his skin turns
as  hard  as  that of a real Storm Giant, granting him an Armour Class  of  0
(Dexterity, defensive spells, and armour of storm giant size can improve this
Armour  Class further); his Strength becomes 24, granting him a +6  bonus  on
his  to-hit rolls and 12 points of additional damage on each physical  attack
(open  doors  checks  will succeed on rolls of 19 or  less  (17  for  magical
doors);  bend  bars and lift gates checks have a 95% chance of success).  The
priest  also  gains  1d6+1 HP for as long as the spell  lasts.  Finally,  the
priest can also understand and speak the tongue of storm giants.
Vylja's storm shape also has some major disadvantages: as long as the  priest
assumes  this  shape,  he can only cast spells of up to and  including  fifth
level.  Exceptions to this rule are granted powers (including spells), innate
abilities  (like  the spells drow can cast), and of course  spells  that  are
stored  in items. The second disadvantage is that only the caster's non-magic
items  will partake in the transformation, effectively rendering most of  his
magic  items  absolutely useless for the duration of the spell. Magic  rings,
cloaks,  gauntlets, boots, necklaces, bracers, armour (and  other  pieces  of
clothing) have to be removed prior to the casting of this spell or they  will
be utterly destroyed.
The  spell normally lasts for 3 rounds per level of the caster. However,  the
caster can at any time decide to change back to his natural shape (note  that
this  change  is  definitive   no shape swapping  is  possible).  The  caster
regains  1d10 points of damage when he does so. If a successful dispel  magic
forces  the  caster to transform back to his normal shape, he does  not  gain
these hit points. Should the priest die while in storm shape, he is instantly
transformed to his normal form.
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell.

After  the casting of this spell a strong thunderclap occurs in the  area  of
effect.  It  automatically deafens all creatures in the target area  for  two
rounds.  Moreover, all creatures subject to the thunderclap have  to  roll  a
successful  saving throw versus spell in order to remain standing.  Creatures
that fail their saving throw are knocked over by the force of the movement of
air  and  may be stunned for up to one round if the surface they hit is  hard
(stone or metal, for example).
Deafened  creatures  suffer  a   1 penalty  on  surprise,  a  +1  penalty  on
initiative, and any spells they cast requiring a verbal component has  a  20%
chance  of  going  awry. If the creature is stunned, it  cannot  even  defend
itself, let alone cast spells.
Large  creatures  get a +3 on their saving throw, small  creatures  suffer  a
penalty  of   3,  and tiny creatures have to save at  6. Huge  or  gargantuan
creatures are immune to the spell's effects. Note that the caster is  not  in
any way protected against the spell's effects.
The  spell  can  be  used to scare or confuse a group  of  creatures  and  to
disperse  swarms of flying insects. Used defensively, Thunderclap can  deafen
the  party  on purpose so as to avoid the adverse effects of Harpy songs  and
the like.
The  priest needs a small inflated balloon which he has to destroy at the end
of the casting by clapping his hands.

By  casting this spell a priest can remove all air and pressure from the area
of  effect,  a 10-foot sphere. All living creatures present in  the  area  of
effect have to roll a saving throw versus death magic to avoid exploding into
bits  and pieces (which causes death). Those creatures that successfully save
are  dragged along when the air is sucked from the sphere and will  stand  at
about  1 yard from the sphere's edge at the beginning of the following round.
If  they (or other creatures) are pushed into the sphere again, they have  to
save  versus  death magic once more. Those creatures that fail  their  saving
throws  have one tenth of a round (initiative modifier of one) to cast spells
(teleport  without error, word of recall, etc.) before certain death  occurs;
there is not enough time to move or jump out of the sphere.
Vacuum  does  not affect objects, undead, extraplanar creatures  (except  for
elementals which are forced back to their plane of origin if they fail  their
saving  throws), creatures who are protected by magic (amulet of the  planes,
necklace of adaptation, robe of stars, sword of the planes, anti-magic shell,
spell  turning, etc.), and ethereal creatures. Creatures in gaseous form  are
also slain if they fail their saving throws.
The material component is an imperfect gem which contains an air-bubble.

Upon  casting  this spell the caster gains the power to heal  1d6  points  of
damage  for each level he has attained. He is free to divide these dice  over
more  than  one  creature as he deems fit (for example, a  10th-level  priest
could  roll 4d6 to cure his own wounds, 5d6 to cure the wounds of the  part's
fighter,  and  1d6  to  heal some of the damage the party's  illusionist  has
suffered). A priest can cure up to three creatures in a single round, as long
as he is able to touch them with his two hands.
The caster retains his healing capacity (or what is left of it) as long as he
does not engage into combat (melee or missile weapons) and as long as he does
not  cast  spells  other than those belonging to the healing  sphere  (wizard
spells are not allowed either for multi-classed characters). In any case, the
spell will end after one day per level of the caster.

Upon  the completion of this spell a magical platform of dense air is  formed
at  ground level in the area of effect. The platform can be pushed  up  by  a
strong but harmless rising current of air: creatures can struggle through  it
without  too  much difficulty, but spellcasting is impossible underneath  the
platform.  The caster can cause the platform to move up or down at a  maximum
rate  of  10 yards per round. All creatures standing on the platform will  be
moved  accordingly, unless they either jump off or find  some  other  way  of
transportation (flying, for example).
The  caster need not stand on the platform to control its height, but  if  he
wants  to  raise or lower it he has to concentrate on that task  during  each
round  he  wants  to do so. If he does not concentrate on  it,  the  platform
remains stationary. If the caster's concentration is interrupted the platform
stops  with  a jerk (all creatures on it have to make a successful  Dexterity
check to avoid falling off).
The priest's holy symbol is needed as the material component for this spell.

When  this spell is cast, the area of effect is bathed in a golden glow  that
lasts  for about ten seconds and then slowly dims away. This golden light  is
harmless for living creatures (a living web, for example), although Underdark
creatures  like drow and duergar will be affected for one round  as  if  they
were  standing  within the area of effect of a Light spell. The  golden  glow
will, however, cause all natural spider webs within the area of effect to  be
turned into grey and harmless dust. This applies to the webs of large or huge
spiders  and the like as well. All creatures and objects that were  supported
by  the web will fall towards the surface and suffer normal damage for  doing
so.
When  used  solely to counter a web spell, the web will be  destroyed  if  it
fails  a saving throw versus magical fire (18 or more saves). If the  web  is
targeted  along with normal spider webs, the web will never be disintegrated.
However, whether solely targeted or not, a web bathed in the golden glow will
lose  all  its  adhesive properties for the full duration  of  the  glow  (10
seconds), enabling creatures that were stuck in it to free themselves if they
make a successful Dexterity check.
The material components are the caster's holy symbol and an item with a light
spell cast on it. The item disappears during casting.

This  powerful spell enables the priest to channel energy from the  elemental
plane  of  air  into  the prime material plane in order  to  create  a  large
whirlwind.  The whirlwind is 30 feet high, 10 feet wide at its  base  and  30
feet  wide at its top. It comes into existence at the end of the casting time
at  some 15-foot square location determined by the caster. In the next  round
it  moves away in a straight line from its point of origin for 30 feet before
dissipating into ordinary air again. The priest can choose in which direction
the  whirlwind  moves  if  he  concentrates on that  task  during  the  round
following  the casting of the spell. If he has other concerns, the  whirlwind
will move in a random direction   roll 1d8 to see which one.
All  creatures in the total area of effect, which is 15 feet wide and 45 feet
long,  are battered by powerful wind blasts and suffer 3d8 points of  damage.
Trees and buildings suffer structural damage as if hit 3 times by a battering
ram.
If  the  whirlwind cannot attain its full height (when cast underground,  for
example),  its  force  is diminished somewhat: it only deals  3d4  points  of
damage to creatures and inanimate objects only suffer structural damage once.

By  casting  this  spell,  a priest of 'rdrie F`nya  (the  elven  goddess  of
weather,  skies and flying creatures) makes large white wings grow  from  his
shoulders.  Those wings are made of strong feathers and are as large  as  the
priest  is  tall.  They enable him to fly at a speed of 15 in manoeuvrability
class B. While flying, the priest can use weapons but he suffers a  1 penalty
on  his  attack  dice rolls. He can also cast spells that do  not  require  a
somatic component.
Because the wings grow from his shoulders, the priest must wear clothing that
makes it possible for the wings to come into existence. This implies that the
caster  cannot be wearing any type of armour when he utters the  spell    the
wings  will fail to reach their normal size and disappear immediately. Normal
clothing  can be adapted for use with wings by cutting holes (some  6  inches
across)  in  it  at  shoulder height. The wings  can  be  combined  with  the
protection provided by spells or by items like a bracers of defence or a ring
of protection (but not a magical cloak, unless it was especially made for the
purpose).
The  wings themselves are AC 8 (unless magically protected), and due to their
size  and  weight the priest also suffers an Armour Class penalty of  1  when
flying  and  a penalty of 2 when walking or standing on the surface.  If  the
wings  disappear, either at the end of the duration or through  a  successful
dispel  magic,  a  flying priest will plummet towards the ground  and  suffer
normal falling damage.
In order to cast this spell the priest needs his holy symbol and two feathers
of a flying creature that is at least size M.

This  spell  enables specialty priests of 'rdrie F`nya (the elven goddess  of
air,  weather,  and  flying creatures) to summon a  special  mount  from  the
elemental plane of air: a zephyr. Zephyrs are large flying creatures  with  a
remarkable physical resemblance to giant eagles, but their bodies consist  of
dense  air  instead  of  bones and blood. Their bodies and  feathers  usually
appear  a translucent white, but this changes into the colours of the rainbow
when shone upon by the sun. A zephyr has these statistics:

     Zephyr.

     4 HD; 30 HP; AC 7.
     MV 3, flight 48 (B); THAC0 15.
     Number of Attacks 3; Damage 1d6/1d6/2d6.
           If  it has dived for more than 50 feet, it gains a bonus of +4  on
its attack role, and the claw damage is doubled (but not the beak attack).
     Intelligence: 10 (limited telepathy with the priest).
           Special Defences: Due to its exceptional eyesight, a zephyr cannot
be  surprised during the day, nor can its rider. Only magical weapons can hit
a zephyr.
     Magic Resistance: 15% (also for its rider).
     Alignment: Neutral.
     Size: L (10-foot high, 20-foot span).
     Morale: 20 (absolute loyalty to the priest).
     XP Value: 1000.

As  all  zephyrs  belong to the retinue of 'rdrie F`nya, the goddess  has  to
grant  her personal permission to the summons of the priest. The zephyr  will
stay until the spell expires, but the priest can send it back to its plane of
origin whenever he wants to. Only the priest who has summoned it can ride the
zephyr, and no special proficiency is needed for him to do so.
A  zephyr can only be hit by magical weapons. It is also vulnerable to spells
that  penetrate  its  magic resistance. Dispel magic, abjure  and  banishment
will,  if successful, send the zephyr back to its plane of origin early.  The
zephyr can only be cured by the spells of the priest that summoned it. Should
a  zephyr  die, while serving a priest, the priest will be unable  to  summon
another  one  until  he  has repented, performing a special  service  to  his
goddess.  Even if the zephyr is not killed, only one summons for  the  animal
will be granted each week.
The priest needs his holy symbol to cast this spell, and a feather of a giant
eagle.

This powerful psionic allows the dreamer to transport the physical
bodies  of  others  into Dreamland.  This power  requires  intense
concentration  during  the preparation time and  any  interruption
will  have the same effect as rolling a 20.  The preparation  time
may  be  skipped  in an emergency, but the power score  will  then
become  Int-15.   This is the same as entering Dreamland  normally
for  a  dreamer, but all victims are physically in Dreamland,  and
cannot  escape,  except with a Wish spell.  Any dreamers  who  are
being  forced  in  this  way must make a  wisdom  roll.   If  they
succeed, then they have entered Dreamland normally, otherwise, all
Dreamland powers are gone.  As well, dreamers forced in  via  this
spell have their mind destroyed (Intelligence 1, Wisdom 1) until a
Wish or Heal spell is used.

Power  Score:   The  minds of the victims are destroyed  as  above
(including any dreamers)

20:    The   dreamer  becomes  a  Lost  One  (Ravenloft  Monstrous
Compendium) and is transported to Ravenloft where only   Wish  can
restore  their  mind  or  the mind of  the  dreamer  is  stuck  in
Dreamland and the body becomes a lifeless shell.  Only a  god  can
restore  the  dreamer from the later form, and this  is  no  small
task,  so  the god may require a rather dangerous task in  return.
The result of a 20 is up to the DM.

This creates a similar enchantment as the warstone on a single boulder (up to
large catapult size). The wizard can then make this boulder hurl itself up to
a  distance  of 10 feet per level, doing damage as if hurled by  a  catapult.
Upon  striking,  the boulder shatters and inflicts 2d8 damage  in  a  30-foot
radius.  The material component is an unworked boulder. The shards  disappear
after the casting.

This  spell  is  similar to the 2nd-level warp wood spell,  except  as  noted
above, and that metal substances are affected. For those objects that possess
structural  strength,  this spell does 1 point of  structural  damage  per  3
levels of the priest. Against metal creatures (iron golems, for example)  the
spell  inflicts  1d4 points of damage + 1 per level of the priest  (save  for
half damage).

This  spell  enchants up to three small pebbles, which can be no larger  than
sling bullets. They can then be hurled or slung at an opponent. The warstones
have  a  +3  to-hit  and to damage, and are considered to  be  enchanted  for
purposes  for  determining if a creature can be struck.  Upon  striking,  the
stone shatters and flings shards in a 5-foot radius, inflicting 1d3 points of
damage,  or only 1 if the stone is smaller than sling bullet size. The  stone
will still shatter if it misses.

The material components are three unworked stones.

Using this spell, the caster can summon a normal animal and force it to watch
over a particular area or person, for the duration of the spell.
If  the  desired  animal type exists within range, a typical  member  of  the
species  will be summoned at the end of the casting. The caster can  converse
with  the animal if he has a way to do it, which may modify the saving  throw
or even negate it all together, if the animal agrees to the task.
The animal must roll a saving throw versus spell, with failure indicating  it
has  fall  under the caster's command for the duration of the spell.  If  the
saving throw succeeds, the animal remains unaffected and can leave at will.
The caster can instruct the animal as he sees fit. The animal is then able to
mentally inform the caster that something has happened. Examples:
           An  eagle  informs the caster that three large creatures  approach
from the east.
           A  cat informs the caster that a certain creature it was bound  to
protect is under attack.
This  spell  was  designed for the Dark Sun campaign  world.  The  spell  was
created by the thri-kreen earth druid Kll'Rkh.

Upon  casting  this  spell and successfully touching the victim,  the  caster
causes the victim's cells to become microscopic gates to the elemental  plane
of water. As a result, every cell in the victim's body swells with water. The
deleterious  effects result from increased pressure on the  brain.  Not  only
does  the severity of this condition increase over time, but the effects  are
cumulative, such that those suffered during stage 2 are in addition to  those
endured during stage 1, and so on.
Stage  1:  On  the first round of the spell, the victim's facial  and  bodily
features  become distorted, he begins sweating profusely, and he suffers  the
effects  of  a migraine headache. In game terms, he suffers a  2  penalty  to
attack,  damage,  and  saving  throws. In  addition,  his  Armour  Class  and
initiative are worsened by 2 points. This condition causes spells and psionic
powers  to  fail unless the victim makes a successful Constitution  check;  a
separate  check  must be made for each spell or power used  while  under  the
effects of this spell.
Stage  2:  During the second through fifth rounds, the victim suffers  as  if
under  the effects of a Confusion spell. On the sixth round, the victim  must
make  a  system shock roll. If he succeeds, he still suffers from  confusion,
but  his condition does not worsen this round. Each round thereafter, he must
make a system shock check with a cumulative  10% modifier (i.e.,  10% on 7th,
20% on 8th,  30% on 9th, etc.). On a failed check, proceed to stage 3.
Stage  3:  The  victim  falls  to the ground  as  his  body  is  racked  with
convulsions; he is unable to attack or defend himself, nor can he cast spells
or  use  psionic  powers. On the round after he falls into  convulsions,  the
victim must again make a system shock roll using his normal percentage (start
with  original system shock percentage; do not include any penalties suffered
above).  A  successful check means that the victim continues to convulse  for
that  round;  his condition does not worsen. Each round thereafter,  he  must
make a system shock check with a cumulative  10% modifier. On a failed check,
proceed to stage 4.
Stage  4: The victim falls into a coma for 1d100 days. On the last day  (even
if  the  victim is brought out of the coma by magical means),  he  must  save
versus  death  magic. A failed check means the victim dies.  A  passed  check
means the victim survives but suffers brain damage (roll 2d4 for Intelligence
and  Wisdom  to determine new ability scores   new scores must be  less  than
previous scores, reroll if necessary).
If  for  any reason, the victim does not progress to the 4th stage  of  water
intoxication   for example, the duration of the spell expires or a successful
dispel  magic  is  cast on the victim   he will suffer  the  effects  in  the
reverse order (i.e., stage 3, stage 2, stage 1) for a length of time equal to
the  number  of  rounds he was affected by the spell. For example,  after  an
initial round of migraine pain (stage 1), Julatok suffers from confusion  for
7  rounds (stage 2) and lapses into convulsion for 4 rounds (stage 3)  before
his  companion  is  able  to cast dispel magic on him successfully.  He  will
continue  to convulse for 4 more rounds. The convulsions will disappear,  and
he  will  suffer  from  confusion and a migraine for 7 rounds.  Finally,  the
confusion  dissipates, leaving a migraine headache for  1  round.  In  total,
Julatok suffered the effects of water intoxication for 24 rounds.
Water  intoxication affects all creatures with well-defined  nervous  systems
(even  water  dwellers, such as fish). The material component is  a  drop  of
water  from  the elemental plane of water; water from any other source  (eg.,
the  prime material plane) will cause the spell to fail. The caster  may  use
his  ability to gate in water in order to obtain this component, and  he  may
store  it  for later use as long as it is not contaminated by water from  any
other source. This spell does not operate on the elemental plane of water nor
will it work under water.

This  multi-purpose spell was developed for the exploration of the  elemental
plane of water. It requires only one word to bring into operation, so it  can
be  cast underwater. The spell can take one of two forms, chosen at the  time
of casting:
           Water breathing can be bestowed upon one creature per three levels
of the wizard.
           Water  survival can be bestowed on a single creature. It includes:
water  breathing, free action for the purposes of underwater  movement  only,
and  a swimming speed of 18. As well, the beneficient receives a +2 bonus  to
all surprise rolls while underwater.
Five  levels are added to the caster's for the purpose of determining whether
water survival is dispelled.

With  this spell, the caster causes a crystal clear blue whip to form in  his
hand    the weapon is made entirely of water. If the caster successfully hits
with  the water whip in melee, the target suffers damage equal to 1d2  (or  1
for  Large  creatures) + 1 point per level of the caster. Thus, an  8th-level
priest  will  do either 9 or 10 points of damage. If the priest hits  with  a
natural  20,  he  has succeeded in disarming his opponent; the  target  still
takes  damage.  A  creature attacking with only natural  weapons  (teeth  and
claws, for example) cannot be disarmed in this manner.
Any  creature  especially susceptible to water damage suffers double  damage.
Note:  double damage does not apply to creatures susceptible to  holy  water,
such as undead (the water that composes the whip is not holy water).
Although magical in origin, it is not considered a magical weapon unless cast
by high level priests (tenth level or greater). That is, for casters of tenth
level  or greater, the water whip is considered a weapon, +1; for casters  of
twentieth level or greater, it is considered a weapon, +2; and so on.
In  addition to the caster's holy symbol, the spell requires a leaf from  any
water-dwelling plant as a material component.

This  spell creates an invisible, thin membrane around the recipient and  any
objects  in  his possession, through which water cannot pass, except  at  the
mouth (water breathing, for example, is not hindered if it is in effect,  but
it  is  not otherwise provided by this spell). Its purpose is to protect  and
keep  dry  objects  that  could otherwise be damaged or  destroyed  by  water
(spellbooks,  torches, tinderboxes, etc.), since precipitation  merely  beads
and rolls off the recipient and bodies of water do not penetrate the barrier.
The  spell  does  not  confer any special abilities  to  survive  or  breathe
underwater, but it will keep the wizard and his possessions dry while there.
If  used against a creature native to the elemental plane of water, the spell
inflicts 1d4 points of damage on a successful attack roll.
The  wizard may affect an additional man-sized creature for every extra level
of  experience. The material component of the spell is a duck  feather  or  a
small square of oilcloth.

The  caster  of this spell selects a target, and that target is struck  by  a
wave  of  pain. It bypasses all armour and can strike from any direction.  It
causes 1d4 + 1d4 per two levels of the caster damage. If the target fails  to
save  versus spell it is also stunned for the current and next round. No  to-
hit  roll is required. The material components for this spell are a piece  of
cloth, formerly worn by a lich, and a dragon's tooth.

To cast the spell, the wizard places a length of waxed string and some copper
coins  (the material components of this spell) in a cloth bag and  casts  the
spell. All the sound heard after the spell is cast, during a time interval of
1  minute per copper coin is "recorded" on the string. The wizard can  record
on one string per level.
Burning the string will release the sounds in the same order, frequency,  and
decibel range in which they were recorded.
Note: hmm, what a great way to make hidden recordings of confessions! Have to
watch out for that.

The  wax  to  flesh spell turns any wax into flesh. If the wax was originally
living, this spell restores life and possessions provided a successful system
shock  roll. Thus, any creature transformed into wax can be restored to flesh
regardless  of  size. When cast upon ordinary wax, the caster  can  affect  a
volume  of  10  cubic feet per level. In this case, the flesh  is  inert  and
lifeless.
The  reverse, flesh to wax, turns flesh of any sort into wax. All possessions
are  converted  to  wax  also. The victim is allowed a  saving  throw  versus
polymorph to resist the effects of this spell. Failure means that the  victim
is  immediately  turned into a statue of wax. As with  flesh  to  stone,  any
statue  created  by this spell is subject to breakage or weathering;  however
since  wax  is  much more fragile than stone, the resulting  statue  is  more
susceptible to these threats.
Wax  statues  are  especially susceptible to fire and heat  damage.  Any  wax
figure left exposed to fire (or acid) or heat (eg., the desert sun) in excess
of  100oF  suffers  damage  per the following table,  and  the  victim,  once
restored  to  flesh,  appears as if mutilated by  acid.  Remember,  that  the
surface  temperature in the desert is hotter than the air temperature    when
it is 100oF seven feet off the ground, it can be 170oF on the surface.
The DM rolls 1d4 and modifies the roll depending upon the type of damage. For
normal  fires  (eg., a campfire), the DM modifies the roll by  adding  1  for
every  round of exposure. For magical fires (eg., fireballs), the DM modifies
the  roll by the amount of damage inflicted. For heat damage, the DM modifies
the  roll by 1 and adds 1 for every 10oF above 100oF multiplied by the number
of  hours exposed. For example, a wax stature is exposed to a the desert  sun
all  day, during which the temperature exceeds 100oF for 2 hours (+2),  110oF
for  2 hours (+4), and 120oF for 1 hour (+3). The DM rolls 3 on 1d4, modifies
the roll by +9, and consults the following table for the effects under 9. The
victim,  if returned to flesh, permanently loses 5 points of Charisma  and  9
HP. As can be seen, the effects are cumulative.

     Modified
     D4 Roll   Effects
      1  4   Restored individual is horribly scarred, Charisma reduced  by  5
points  (cannot  be  reduced below 1). This damage  can  only  be  healed  by
regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      5  9   Restored individual permanently loses hit points  equal  to  the
modified roll (cannot be reduced below 1 HP). This damage can only be  healed
by regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      10  14      One  of  the victim's limbs is unusable;  the  DM  randomly
determines which, using 1d4 (1: left arm; 2: right arm; 3: left leg; 4: right
leg). This damage can only be healed by regenerate, wish, or similar magic.
      15+   Restored individual is dead. He can be brought back to life  with
resurrection,  wish, or similar magic. Note: raise dead will not  work  since
the body will not be whole.

The material component is a small wax statue.

This  spell conjures a smooth ring, visible only to the caster, which  begins
to  crystallise at a rate according to the information used to focus it  (the
more  information available, the faster the crystallisation), varying from  1
day  to  1 week. The wayfinder portal tries to locate a target (place, thing,
or person), identified by an image, location, scent, name, or magic pattern.
Once  found, it can be looked at through the ring or the ring can  be  walked
through  to  reach the target spot. However, the point of egress is  normally
not the spot watched, but some other place relatively nearby that is safe  to
the caster (thus the wizard might appear a day's walk away from the target or
so).  Also,  it will not bring the caster into a private building  or  church
which the caster has not been in before or been invited to enter into. Others
cannot use the ring.

This is a defensive spell which causes the target creature to lose 1d4 1 +  1
per level of the priest points of Strength. The creature's Strength cannot be
lowered  past  3  due  to  the  effects of the spell.  If  the  creature  has
exceptional Strength, then the loss of Strength is on a 10% per point  ratio.
A Strength of 18/01 to 18/09 will drop to 18 before dropping to 17.
Creatures  that are successfully subjected to this spell, will tend  to  lose
the  urge  to  attack the priest if their Strength is dropped an  appreciable
amount.  The  material component of this spell is a drop of  poison.  Priests
that are not allowed to use poisons aren't allowed to cast this spell either.

      Weasel  wire allows a character to surreptitiously open a lock  without
having  to vocalize a command. Anybody may use the enchanted wire,  not  just
the wizard The base chance to open a lock is 10% per level until tenth level.
At  tenth level and above, the best chance to succeed can't exceed 99%.  This
can be modified up or down by the quality or subtlety of the lock. This spell
won't  find  traps or tricks, nor disarm them. But if performed  successfully
the  traps  won't be triggered, just as if the actual key had been  used  and
used  properly.  A  failed roll indicates the trap was sprung  and  the  lock
unopened.  Only one attempt per lock may be made. Failure means the character
can't  open  the lock with this spell. Weasel wire has no effect  on  barred,
bolted, or jammed objects, only on key-activated systems.

      To cast the spell, the caster holds a piece of brass wire, no more than
6  inches in length and somatically gestures. This wire can be used by others
or  even be moved by telekinesis to its point of use. The wire is inserted in
the lock and wiggled.

      Note  that  transport or sale of an effective item is  limited  by  the
spell's duration. It is also worth considering how legal this spell is. While
beneficial  to locksmiths, its misuses are obvious. If this spell  is  widely
known, there is likely to be government restrictions on weasel wire.

This  spell causes a short length of rope, hair, ribbon, twine or thread  (up
to  1  foot per level of the wizard long) to weave and knot itself around  or
into  anything  the wizard wishes (even itself). The knot  is  usually  quite
intricate, and can be extremely difficult to untie by hand. It can be used to
join  two ends of rope together. Given enough raw material, it could even  be
used to weave 1 square foot per level of the wizard of cloth or tapestry.
The  caster of the spell can command the knot to untie at any time, and  also
to retie itself. All other creatures cannot untie the lock, although they may
be  able  to cut or break the string or rope the knot is on. This  effect  is
permanent,  and  the knot will detect as magical. In the  case  of  cloth  or
tapestry made from this spell, it will not unravel. However, it may be  torn,
ripped, or cut.
Alternatively, the wizard can opt for the knot to be inextricable  by  anyone
else. This is not permanent, and the knot will not detect as magical.

      This  spell  creates  a single strand of web that  enwraps  the  target
creature  much like a spider wraps its prey. A successful saving throw  means
the  victim  has  dodged the web and is unaffected. Enwrapped  creatures  may
break  free if they make a successful bend bars roll (substract the  caster's
level),  otherwise  they are held immobile. The material  component  of  this
spell is a piece of spider web.

invisibility (q.v.). For the chance to detect invisibility (see  the  Dungeon
Master's  Guide, page 60), an observer is treated as five levels higher  than
actual. In all other aspects, this spell is the same as invisibility.

This spell conjures up a small whirlpool, 5 feet high, and 3 feet wide at the
top.  This  miniature water elemental has AC 5, 2 HD, MV 190 feet per  round,
hits  twice for 1d4 and can be struck by normal weapons. In water combat this
can  confuse  up to 100 small fish, 70 medium fish, 30 large  fish,  10  huge
fish,  or  one giant fish. On land, anyone trapped inside the whirlpool  must
make  a  saving  throw versus spell or suffer 1d2 points of drowning  damage.
Spending  more than 15 consecutive rounds in a whirlpool without the  aid  of
some  magical  water  breathing spell or device, will force  a  saving  throw
versus death magic. If the subject fails, he will fall unconscious. If he  is
not  aided  within 3 rounds he will die. Should he remain in  the  pool,  but
save, he will continue to take damage each additional round, and continue  to
make saving throws. Spells have a 40% chance of success within the whirlpool.
The whirlpool can easily put out non-magical fires of any type. Any native of
the  elemental plane of water can easily dissolve the whirlpool with a touch,
including another whirlpool.

This spell is similar in nature to fireball and lightning bolt. However,  the
spell is limited to a single glob, and has no area effect. On the other hand,
the  acid glob will do 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster. The glob
is  a  yellowish  substance that splatters all over the target  upon  impact.
However,  if  the  target  saves,  the glob hits  only  scathingly,  and  the
remaining  half  will  travel on, and thus might  hit  someone  else,  should
another creature be standing behind the primary target. This target saves  to
see if he gets only half or no damage.

When  this  spell  is  cast, an area as specified bthe caster  within  stated
limits,  will transform into a four feet deep pool of acid. Movement in  this
pool is reduced to  . As long as creatures are in this pool they receive acid
damage, dependant on exposure. The damage while upright or wading is 2d6  per
round, and that of those who are lying in it, or attempt to swim to the sides
(might  be  faster) 2d10 per round. At the end of the spell, the acid  drains
away,  but  the trench or pool remains a depression. For this spell  to  have
effect,  the  area or volume must exist for the pool to form in.  This  is  a
great  spell  to stop those pesky townspeople from following you  in  pursuit
after you burned down half their city in some sorcerous fight.

With  this spell, the caster gets the ability to breathe a cone of acid as  a
black  dragon.  The damage is twice the number of hit points of  the  caster,
halved  if  the targets successfully save versus breath weapon. The  material
component  is a drop of acid that must be ingested by the caster,  doing  2d4
points  of  damage  to him. Note that for damage purposes,  the  maximum  hit
points of the caster are taken, so the damage due to the acid does not reduce
the effectiveness of the spell, nor any other damage to the caster.

This  spell hides the caster's persona from the world. The use of this  spell
will  make it so that as far as magical and mental forces are concerned, your
psyche, your persona, does not exist. Divination spells such as detect  good,
ESP,  etc., will come up blank, since as far as the spells are concerned  the
caster  is  simply not there. As a by-effect, this also renders all  thought-
related  psionics useless. This is a two-way street, however. If  the  caster
has  psionic abilities, he will be unable to use his powers while  under  the
influence of the spell, but enemy psionicists will also be unable to find him
or  attack  his mind in any way. Only such physical psionic effects  such  as
molecular  agitation still work, no attack modes do. This  is  highly  useful
combined  with such spells as invisibility. The spell forms a sort of  shield
wall  around the caster but this gets weakened with every attempt  to  breach
it.  Thus  the  spell  will only remain active for twice the  caster's  level
psionic attacks or divination spells directed at the caster, after which  the
wall will crumble completely.

This  powerful  spell  summons an archomental. One of  the  great  rulers  of
domains  in  the  elemental planes. These creatures have all  powers  of  the
elemental of their plane, are 36 HD, and have the following additional powers
and  improvements:  an Armour Class of -6, number of attacks  4,  damage  per
attack  6d10,  special  defence: need weapon, +5 or better  to  hit,  special
attacks  are at 10 times normal effectiveness (ten times more damage, greater
area  of  effect,  etc.). These creatures are extremely  resentful  of  being
summoned,  and  though forced to do the caster's bidding, will  remember  the
caster in times to come. Should the caster ever visit the elemental plane  of
an  archomental he once summoned, he should be in for a lot of  trouble,  and
will  be  under  continuous attacks by vengeful followers  of  the  elemental
ruler.
The  type  of elemental summoned depends on the material component used.  For
the  fire archomental, burning rare woods of 50,000 gp or more; for the water
archomental,  a  basin filled with sweetwater potions (at  least  20  potions
worth are needed); for the earth archomental, gems in excess of 50,000 gp are
needed, and finally; for the air archomental, 50,000 gp worth of rare perfume
or  incense  is needed. These material components can form a great  obstacle,
especially  those  for  the fire archomental summoning,  as  sometimes  great
quantities  are  needed. To be able to carry around the  material  components
would require the most special and rare woods and incense (etc.) indeed,  and
the  finding  of  these substances could almost be an  adventure  in  and  of
itself.

This  spell  is similar to a fireball, except that there is no saving  throw,
and  the  damage is only 1d4 points per level. The spell is also not affected
by  such  spells as globe of invulnerability, various shield spells, wall  of
force, etc. It will sail right through them. Only magic resistance or an anti-
magic shell can protect the target(s) of this spell.

This  powerful  summoning spell opens a gate to Limbo, from which  1d4  chaos
elementals  are  called  forth. Chaos elementals are  not  strictly  speaking
elementals,  they  are the embodiment of a multitude of  chaotic  souls.  The
elementals appear as fleshy mounds with human features interspersed all  over
their  bodies  (think of Freddie in some of the later movies, pinhead  before
released  from the statue in Hellraiser III etc.). The chaos elementals  have
6d6  HD,  and  do damage for 1 HP per Hit Die when attacking.  They  have  an
Armour  Class of 0, and move at MV 12 (for more on chaos elementals  see  the
Manual of the Planes, Features of Limbo).

When this spell is cast, the caster points at a target, and tries to hit  it.
Use  the  THAC0  of  a  fighter  of same level,  negating  armour,  rings  of
protection,  cloaks  of  protection, bracers and such.  Only  Dexterity,  and
cloaks  of displacement or other such evading magics work against this spell.
If  the  target is struck, it will be encased in a three inch thick layer  of
ice.  The  encased creature gets one bend bars/lift gates roll to see  if  it
escapes  or not (i.e. breaks the ice); after that, muscle lethargy  sets  in.
The ice, in order to break or be removed, has twice as many hit points as the
caster of the spell. Only fire or physical weapons do full damage, acid  does
half,  electric or cold attacks none. If the creature is not removed  in  two
turns, it will enter suspended animation. The ice magically maintains itself,
thus creatures could be imprisoned forever.

This powerful necromantic spell is designed for that wizard who has sustained
a lot of damage, and would like to give it to someone else. The wizard utters
the  arcane  words of the spell, and points at some creature.  That  creature
will  sustain  all  damage the wizard has sustained so far,  and  leaves  the
wizard  without  wounds.  That is, if the creature fails  its  saving  throw.
Through  this spell all the wizard's wounds disappear, no matter  what  their
origin or magnitude, only such wounds as severed limbs and the like cannot be
healed.  If  the amount of damage is more than the creature can sustain,  the
creature  dies instantly from the damage and the shock, even a  creature  who
would not die from the wounds, but sustains more than half its hit points  in
damage, must roll a system shock, or die from the trauma anyway.

This  spell brings into being one globe of negative material for every  three
levels of the caster. These globes can be targeted at one or multiple targets
(as many as there are globes). Each globe strikes the target unerringly, like
a magic missile, but is unhindered by any defensive spells. It roars straight
through force fields, shields, etc. Only magic resistance (if successful)  or
an anti-magic shell or similar magic stops such a bolt. Each bolt does damage
for 3d6+3 points.

The  ultimate  spell for the wizard who does not want to  bother  carrying  a
staff, but might want to fight some nasty creatures with one since he has the
proficiency  anyway.  This spell calls into being  a  7-foot  staff  of  pure
blackness. This is actually a piece of the negative material plane,  and  its
powers  therefore depend greatly on the control a wizard can exert  over  the
arcane  matter, hence on his level. The effects and powers of the  staff  are
listed as follows (make a saving throw versus death magic):

     Wizard's
     Level     Staff     Special Powers
     1-3  +1   no powers
     4-6  +2   drains 1d6 if the saving throw failed
     7-9  +3   drains an additional 1d6 if the saving throw failed
     10-12     +4   stunned for 1d4 rounds if the saving throw failed
      13-15     +5   can be used to shoot globes of negative material for 3d6
points of damage up to 1 yard per level
      14-16      +5   can be used to absorb a spell cast specifically at  the
caster (physical only)
     17+  +5   drains one level per Hit Die if the saving throw failed

The  powers  listed  in  the rightmost column are  cumulative.  Thus,  if  an
archmage hits with the staff, the victim must make four saving throws  versus
death magic, and if the target fails all saving throws, he would take regular
staff  damage plus 5 (bonus) plus 2d6 (first two powers), be stunned for  1d4
rounds, and lose one level of experience.
Note: this spell might be seen by some as too powerful as second level spell,
but  was put there because of the lack of good offensive 2nd-level spells  in
the original TSR lists.

When  this spell is cast, two normal darts per level of the caster come  into
existence,  streaking towards their appointed target(s). The fact that  these
darts,  once created, are normal, makes them unaffected by shield,  globe  of
invulnerability, or anti-magic shell type spells. However, each dart must  be
rolled  for  to hit, at the caster's level as though he were a  fighter.  The
material component for the spell is a single golden dart of at least 500  gp,
which is consumed in the casting of the spell.

When  this spell is cast, a bluish vapour snakes over from the caster to  the
target. At this point, the target attempts to save at -4. If its saving throw
succeeds,  the vapour disperses, else the vapour grabs a hold on the  target.
The  target is frozen in place while the vapour begins to envelop the target.
It  takes  the vapour six rounds to fully envelope the target. All the  while
the  caster  must  be concentrating fully on the vapour. The  vapour  can  be
stopped  at  any time by the caster, or by someone breaking the concentration
ofthe  caster. Each round, the vapour drains 15% of the targets  hit  points,
leaving  the target freezing cold. At the second round, the target is  forced
to  shiver, and will abandon all he holds to hug himself for warmth.  At  the
fourth round, the target will sink to its knees shivering. At the end of  the
sixth  round,  the target will be lying on the ground with  10%  of  its  hit
points left and unable to do anything more than shake uncontrollable for  the
next  3d4 rounds. A nice punishment for those who cross your wizard, but  you
do not want to kill.

This  powerful summoning spell causes the appearance of a full company of  20
spined devils (see the Monster Manual II), commanded by a barbed devil.  This
spell  should  only be cast by a wizard who is truly evil. If the  caster  is
lawful evil, the creatures will obey the wizard unhesitatingly, if the caster
is  of  another form of evil, they will still obey commands, but unwillingly,
and have a 5% cumulative chance of turning upon the caster per devil that  is
killed  in action while under the influence of this spell (this is per  spell
use, i.e. every new spell this starts at 0% chance).
Should  this  spell  be  cast by a neutral or good caster,  the  devils  will
immediately attack their summoner. They will fight until the barbed devil  is
slain, upon which the rest gates back to hell. The spell comes with one small
problem. The devils will remain even after the spell duration is ended,  they
merely  are no longer forced to do the summoners wishes (only if the  leader,
that is the barbed devil is still alive).
If  the summoner is lawful evil, the devils will be neutrally disposed toward
the  caster, and will do whatever the DM wants them to do (leave, go  rampage
the  countryside, whatever). However, they will be inclined to  bargain  with
the  summoner. Thus, if the caster wishes further services out of the devils,
he  will have to offer something (gold or gems are not accepted, only magical
items, knowledge useful to their arch-devil masters, etc.). If the caster  is
another  form  of  evil, he may have to bargain for his life.  That  is,  the
devils  will attack the summoner unless appeased with gifts, similar  as  for
lawful evils asking for further services. The material component is a barb or
teeth of a barbed devil.

This  powerful spell opens a small gate to the positive material plane inside
the  target creature. If the creature wishes, he could attempt to resist  the
spell  by successfully making a saving throw versus spell, in which case  the
opening of the gate fails. The caster must upon casting the spell decide  for
how  long the gate should remain open. The caster can attempt to maintain the
gate  for up to 1 round per three caster levels. However, such a gate is  not
completely  stable,  and the actual effect will be 1 to 2  rounds  longer  or
shorter (roll 1d4: 1 = 2 rounds less, 2 = 1 round less, 3 = 1 round longer, 4
=  2  rounds  longer).  The  effect of such a concentrated  gate  inside  the
target's body is the following. The positive radiance will add 2d10 HP to the
creature per round of exposure. However, if the total amount of hit points is
exceeded (the creature is fully healed, but the gate remains in effect),  the
hit  points will temporarily be added, but with the cumulative chance of  20%
per  round  of  "overloading" that the creature's body receives  a  surge  of
radiance,  causing the body to explode. If the body explodes in this  manner,
there is no way to bring the creature back to life.
If  hit points are gained beyond maximum, without exploding, those hit points
will  remain  for  20  rounds and then recede by one point  per  round  until
regular  maximum  hit points are reached. An exploding  body  will  not  hurt
bystanders,  other  than bowling them over, and thus  maybe  causing  1d6  HP
falling damage or something like that, but it will definitely smear the  area
around the exploded creature with the creature's blood and itty bitty pieces.
This  spell  should only be used in dire emergencies, or can be  used  as  an
attack spell on an as yet unharmed creature.
Only  living creatures are affected by the healing process. If the  spell  is
utilized  on  undead, the effects will be spectacular.  The  undead  will  be
allowed a saving throw, but if the saving throw fails, it will explode  in  a
brilliant explosion, shattering the physical body, if any is possessed,  into
tiny shards, and causing the psyche to be utterly annihilated.

This  spell is essentially a fireball centred on the caster himself. However,
the  caster himself is not affected by the fire or concussion effects of  the
spell.  It was designed to fend off mobs surrounding the caster. The fireball
will  do  the usual 1d6 per level hit points of damage, as well as throw  all
creatures in the area of effect 1 foot per level divided by the distance from
the  caster  away  from the caster. The flames and explosion  either  radiate
outwards  from the caster in a planar fashion, or conically upwards depending
on the casters will (cone extending 1 yard per level, 60  spread).

When  this  spell  is  cast, it will begin to snow in  the  area  of  effect.
However, these flakes are no ordinary flakes. They are acidic in nature,  and
damage  creatures for 5d4 points of damage per round. If a successful  saving
throw  is  made, the creature will only suffer half damage, but  this  saving
throw must be made anew every round. The acid is extremely corrosive, and all
exposed  items  must  save versus acid or be destroyed utterly,  again  every
round. this spell is extremely powerful and will cause much loss in both  hit
points and items that the victims may be carrying.

This  spell  is an improvement of the teleport spell. Instead of  opening  an
instantaneous conduit from one place to another, this spell creates a  portal
that  stays  open  until the caster wills it away, it  is  dispelled  or  one
creature per level of the caster has passed through. Note that to pass  first
one way, then back by the same creature counts as two passes.
This spell allows the caster to flee to get help from the other side, or take
a  short  breather on the other side before coming back. However, the  portal
manifests  itself as a shimmering silver plane, and anyone who wants  to  can
pass  through as long as it is activated. Hence it is not a good way to  flee
from pursuit, as the pursuit can follow through the portal as well, since the
caster has to concentrate for some ten seconds to close the portal.
For  success  in  anchoring the portal, the same rules  apply  as  a  regular
teleport,  thus caster beware, you might be in for a fall, or end up  encased
in  stone. However, if the first one through runs into solids, that  material
will end up in front of the portal on the opened end (the portal replaces the
volume  attempting to pass with equal volume from the other  side).  Some  DM
discretion will be needed with the possibilities this poses.

The material component is a small (3 inch) mithril rod, treated in such a way
as  to  be easily broken. At the end of the spell casting, the caster  breaks
the  rod,  and the portal appears. Note that the rod does not disappear,  but
once broken cannot be reused for this spell.

When the caster casts this spell, he emits a blood curdling scream. All those
within  hearing range are shaken to their very cores. Creatures  with  morale
ratings  have their morales reduced by six, or by three if they  save  versus
spell.  Free willed creatures (PCs and the like) must save or flee  in  fear.
Even if they save, they still attack at -2 against the caster and his party.

      This  is  a  different form of magic missile. Instead of  firing  magic
missiles, the spell conjures up non-magical icicles, which are then  directed
to fly at the targeted opponents. The amount of missiles summoned is the same
as  per magic missile. The missiles can be targeted at multiple opponents (if
the  wizard  has two missiles, he can shoot at two opponents, one missile  at
each).  The  icicles  themselves are non-magical, thus magic  resistance  and
other protections against magical effects or missiles are ineffective, though
protection from normal missiles will protect the shielded target. The icicles
do  damage for 1d4 per missile against normal opponents, but 1d6 per  missile
on  targets  especially  vulnerable  to cold  based  attacks,  such  as  fire
elementals etc.

The  casting of this spell brings five feet of ice and snow to come  crashing
down  in the area of effect. All those caught under the ice and snow will  be
hurt  for 5d8 HP. After the first round, all those not protected against cold
will  receive an additional 1d4 points of damage per round. Crawling movement
out  of the snow (the only method save flying or dimension door or other such
magical  methods)  is only 5 yards per round, and extremely strenuous.  After
exiting the snow and ice by crawling, the target(s) must regain their  breath
for 6 seconds per yard traversed. Fireballs, walls of fire and similar magics
will  melt the ice and snow in a single round, though those trapped will then
suffer  those  effects.  Note  that one's  protection  from  cold  needs  not
necessarily be a magical spell or such. Warm clothing and the like  (see  the
Wilderness  Survival Guide) will also protect against the cold, though  there
is  no  protection  against the first 5d8 HP, since  that  is  mostly  impact
damage.

This spell can only be used by a wizard who openly worships or works for  one
of  the chaotic Dark Gods. The caster must have the symbol of that agency  on
his  person.  The  caster loudly implores this deity's aid while  the  caster
throws the symbol on the ground. The symbol is grasped by a taloned hand that
reaches  up  from  the  ground (destroying tiles, flagstones  or  whatnot  if
necessary), and pulled down. Three seconds later, the ground explodes  upward
in  one place per six levels of the caster. In these places demons rise.  50%
chance of these demons are of type III, 25% type IV, 20% type V, 5% type  VI.
Note that the holy symbol taken by the demons, is not returned to the caster,
since it is considered to be the material component for the spell.
These  demons will remain and fight for or protect the caster for  one  round
per  two caster levels, or until slain. Before the demons are slain (but when
they  are hurt in such a manner that one or two more attacks might kill them)
they  will request the caster that he release them so that they can  flee  to
their own plain (so that they do not need to suffer the penalties demons face
when  slain on the prime material). For every demon refused such release  and
subsequently  slain, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the next  batch  of
demons  summoned by this spell is sent to punish the caster rather than  help
him.  After  such a punishment, this chance is reduced to 0% again,  and  the
cycle begins anew. DM nastiness is expected on this matter.
The  demons  might overstate the extend of their injuries to  escape  further
humiliating  servitude, when asking for early release, etc. Note that  ground
must  be available within the area of effect. This spell will not work  on  a
ship  for  example,  although the solid stone floor of a higher  level  in  a
building  (or lower level of a dungeon) will be enough to let the spell  take
effect.

This  fun spell summons a legion of einheriar, or spirit soldiers. The  spell
will  summon  forth 10d10 spirit soldiers. The troops will be pulled  from  a
plane that corresponds to the caster's alignment, and the power who has these
troops pulled away from his domain may not look too kindly upon this act. The
use  of  the  troops should be in accordance with the tenets of the  caster's
alignment, or there is a 10% cumulative chance per casting of this spell that
the  power  supplying the troops sends them to fight against you rather  than
for  you.  The  powers  and  equipment of the individual  spirit  troops  are
determined as per the rules in the Manual of the Planes, page 122.
It should be noted that the use of this spell can have a very powerful impact
if  a large amount of nasty classes with high levels are summoned. Since  the
soldiers  can  be  highly intelligent, this force could easily  wipe  out  an
entire army if used wisely.

This  protective spell can be cast in advance preparation. The shield  itself
will  not  spring  into existence until a last command word  is  spoken.  The
speaking of this last word can be delayed as much as 1 day per caster  level,
and  the  effect then is instantaneous. A crackling and shimmering  field  of
electricity  will spring into existence around the caster, in a  globe  of  1
foot diameter per caster level. This shield is not solid, and missile objects
have  a 50% - twice the caster's level chance of penetrating the shield.  All
magical effects dissipate against the shield, though the after-effects  could
penetrate  it. That is, a fireball exploding right outside the  shield,  will
still send flames roiling into the sphere, but attempting to let the fireball
explode  inside  the sphere will result into the dissipation of  the  magical
energies  of the fireball, rendering it harmless. Beings attempting to  cross
the  boundary will suffer damage as if the caster cast a lightning bolt  upon
them, 1d6 per level. The duration of the shield itself will be one round  per
caster  level. Only one of these spells can be held in reserve. The  material
component is a small copper rod.

This  spell  will  create  a  special shield that will  jump  into  existence
whenever  the  caster is being attacked by some form of magic,  ranging  from
spells  to breath weapons. The spell will last for up to 1d4 of such  attacks
plus  one  per level of the caster, shielding the caster completely,  like  a
stoneskin.  The one drawbis that the shield will establish itself  only  once
per round, and thus will protect the caster for one attack per round only. If
multiple  magical attacks are made against the caster, all but one  will  get
past the shield. However, the caster can mentally decide against whose attack
to  use the shield, and thus not waste a "charge" on an opponent he does  not
deem  such  protection necessary against. The material component is  a  small
mithril shield (about the size of a coin) of 200 gp value.

This  is an improved version of the animate dead type spells. It will animate
up  to  twice the caster's level Hit Dice of undead within a 60 yard  radius.
These undead have full hit points and be imbued with some of the Intelligence
of  the caster. While the spell is in effect, or as long as any of the undead
remain,  the  caster's Intelligence will be lowered by one point.  Note  that
this  might make the caster unable to cast high level spells after this spell
is  cast. I.e., a wizard with Intelligence 16, will not be able to cast  8th-
level  spells while this spell is in effect. The Intelligence of these undead
allows  them to use weapons to effect, i.e., not just 1d6 but by weapon  type
for  skeletons. The undead can use armour, bows, etc. Still, only zombies  or
skeletons can be made with this spell. The material component is a  piece  of
bone from a lich.

     This spell can be extremely useful, but also extremely dangerous to use.
This  spell  opens  up a link between the wizard's lifeforce  and  his  magic
energy.  Through  the use of this spell, the wizard can  cast  another  spell
without  losing that spell from memory. In stead, the energies for the  spell
are  directly drawn from the wizard himself. The wizard thus gets drained for
an  amount of hit points equal to the square of the spell level of the  spell
the   wizard  casts  subsequent  to  the  magic  sacrifice.  This  drain   is
irrevocable,  and being drained directly from the wizard's life force,  there
is no manner to shield the wizard from this damage, magical nor mundane.

      Also, the damage thus sustained cannot be healed in any other way  than
by  natural healing, thus the wizard will regain only 1 HP per day  of  rest.
Note that if the caster so wishes, he could cast a spell whose draining would
kill  him, in which case only a resurrect, wish, or the like would bring  him
back to life.

      The  spell  opens this link until the next spell is cast, or  until  an
amount of turns has elapsed equal to the caster's level of experience.

spell.  It  is  designed such that it can strike multiple targets.  For  this
spell  however,  the  targets are designated by the caster.  The  caster  can
designate one victim per level. The bolts will strike for 1d6 damage per  two
caster  levels, one bolt per target, as desired by the caster. The bolts  are
not  powerful  enough  to continue after hitting their  targets,  since  upon
hitting, all their energy is spent. If the caster so desires, multiple  bolts
could  be targeted on a single creature. Essentially, the spell provides  the
caster  with  as  many bolts as he has levels, at 1d6 HP per  two  levels  of
experience,  leaving the targeting of those bolts up to  the  wishes  of  the
caster.

This  spell  is the same as the 1st-level Whisper's rune of armouring  spell,
with the following exceptions. The Armour Class increase is two points on any
the allowed garments, and the spell could also be applied to certain kinds of
armour, if the wizard is capable of wearing them, being dual class or  multi-
class. If cast on armour rather than cloth, the power of the spell is reduced
to  an  increase of one in the Armour Class. The armour cannot  already  have
been  magical,  nor will the spell be effective on more than  two  pieces  of
armour  worn  at  the  same  time: a helmet and armour,  armour  and  shield,
whatever  combination the caster desires. If the major  rune  is  cast  on  a
garment already containing a regular rune, the major rune will supersede, and
replace the regular rune.
If the spell is used on a piece of armour, and the caster wishes to also wear
a   cloth   garment   with   the  spell,  only  one   garment   can   be   so
enspelleffectively.  Thus one armour and one cloth  would  work,  the  armour
increased by one Armour Class, the cloth by two.

This  spell is similar in construction as Whisper's dicey healing  gate,  but
this  spell  is  tailored towards the various elemental  planes.  During  the
casting,  the caster must decide to which elemental plane he wishes  to  open
the  gate.  The  gate will appear inside the target creature, and  do  horrid
damage  within the being. The spell is of such power, that only creatures  of
more  Hit  Dice  or greater Intelligence than the caster get a  saving  throw
versus  the  effects. The caster can maintain the gate for a period  of  time
equal to one round per five levels. During this period, if the target did not
receive  or  failed its saving throw, the creature will be assaulted  by  the
element  of  the gate. The different elements will have different effects  on
the affected.
           The element of fire will burn the creature for 4d10 HP damage  per
round  of  exposure. Besides that, the creature is forced to  make  a  saving
throw  versus breath weapon once per round of exposure or die instantly  from
thheat shock.
           The element of water will force the creature to make both a system
shock  roll  and  a  saving throw versus poison once per round  of  exposure.
Failing  the saving throw causes the creature to be paralysed for 1d4  rounds
per  failed  saving  throw, and a failure of a system shock  will  cause  the
target to die instantly.
          The element of earth will cause internal physical damage at 3d10 HP
damage  per round of exposure, and cause the creature to make a system  shock
roll  once  per  round  of  exposure, failing which  the  creature  will  die
instantly.
           The  element  of  air will cause delirium due to  the  superfluous
amount  of  oxygen  inhaled. The affected creature must  save  versus  breath
weapon each round of exposure, or become drunk and delirious, passing out for
1d4 rounds per failed saving throw. The creature must also save versus poison
on  the  third  and each subsequent round, or be afflicted with  a  permanent
insanity.

This bolt of "mana" energy attacks the target's psyche rather than body.  The
target  adds  his  Wisdom and Intelligence scores to his level  in  order  to
figure  out  his  "strength". This spell takes two points per  level  of  the
caster  from this source. Should this reduce the "strength" of the target  to
or  below  zero, the target passes out. Otherwise, the target is  temporarily
deprived  of  that  much  "strength"  but not  otherwise  affected.  However,
multiple  spells might still take out the person. The "strength"  returns  at
two  points  per  round.  When losing points, the  highest  of  Intelligence,
Wisdom,  or  level  is  affected  first. In  case  of  a  tie,  the  target's
Intelligence is affected first, then his Wisdom.

This  spell  is an improvement of the teleport spell, not in the accuracy  of
the spell, like teleport without error, but rather in the amount of stuff the
caster  is  able to take with him. The caster is able to teleport all  beings
and  items within the area of effect to a location, under the same rules  for
safe  arrival  as the 5th-level teleport spell. Unwilling targets  receive  a
saving throw to remain where they are. The caster can specify which beings or
items  inside  the area of effect are and are not teleported,  however  items
held  by  someone else are subject to a saving throw by the  holder  of  that
object  to  negate  its  transport if the  holder  does  not  want  the  item
teleported.  If a spellcaster does not have the teleport without error  spell
in  his  repertoire,  this spell is known to have been  used  by  the  caster
standing  on a table. Should a low arrival be rolled for, the table  will  be
embedded in the ground, but the caster will be safe.

This  spell  is an attempt to furnish low-level wizards with some destructive
power.  This spell can onlyaffect one creature at a time, and is  of  reduced
range.  The  damage  is  still 1d6 per level of the caster  however.  As  per
regular  lightning bolt, if the target saves, it receives only  half  damage.
The  bolt  is  of  weak power, in that it will not rebound, nor  be  powerful
enough  to  hit multiple targets. Once striking a target, all its  charge  is
used up in that singular event.

This  spell  causes a meteor to come swooping down from the skies,  and  rush
headlong  at  its  intended target. The meteor comes  in  with  a  terrifying
shrieking  noise. The meteor will unerringly strike a single target.  If  the
target fails a saving throw versus paralysation, the noise of the meteor will
have  him transfixed, and unable to move. The meteor will strike for  maximum
damage  of 1d4+2 per level of the caster. If the target does make its initial
saving throw, he may attempt to dodge the meteor, if he declares that as  his
action  (do  not automatically roll a saving throw), rolling a  saving  throw
versus breath weapon, in an attempt to halve the damage sustained.
Since  the meteor will come swooping in from the sky, the spell can  only  be
cast when open air is somehow available, though the spell could be cast in  a
room with a fireplace for example. The material component is a small phosphor
crystal which is crumbled to dust during the casting process.

This  less  powerful edition of wall of force creates a force field  that  is
about  the  size of the caster. The caster can put the shield on one  of  his
sides, front or back, left or right, and that side will be fully protected by
the  shield from attacks coming from that side. The shield is not stationary,
but  rather centred on the caster. The shield's size will conform  with  what
the  wizard is doing: if he stretches, the shield will stretch to protect the
full  size of the caster, if the caster crouches down, the shield will shrink
in  size  to  again only shield one individual: the caster himself.  For  all
intents  and purposes the shield is a wall of force. For example, it requires
a disintegration to destroy it before the duration expires, etc.

#9#
This spell creates a gate to one of the outer planes, and calls forth a spell
crystal,  which  is subsequently shot at the target. A spell crystal  is  the
physical  manifestation  of  a summoning spell  on  the  outer  planes.  Upon
touching  it, the target is automatically transported to the spot from  where
the  original  summoning caster was trying to summon some creature  from  the
outer  planes.  This particular spell is tailored towards the  lower  planes,
thus the creature successfully hit by the spell crystal will most likely  end
up  under  the control of some wizard who is attempting to summon a demon  or
devil for some dark purpose. The original purpose of the conjuring spell that
created  the spell crystal before it was plucked away by the casting of  this
particular  spell  should  be up to the DM, and  could  be  almost  anything,
limited only by the imagination of the DM.
There is no saving throw against the effect of the spell itself, though magic
resistance could possibly negate the effect. However, there is a saving throw
to  see  whether  the  target  individual can  dodge  the  spell  crystal.  A
successful  Dexterity check is needed with a -10 penalty. If  the  target  is
missed,  the crystal will fly on to hit another target, if another target  is
available.  If  hitting  a  wall, the crystal  could  bounce  and  hit  other
bystanders, including the caster of the spell. The DM should make a ruling in
that case using the rules from the Dungeon Master's Guide for missed missiles
and  grenade-like objects, or whatever reasonably randomized  method  the  DM
likes  to  use  to see who gets hit, as the crystal will remain in  existence
until a suitable, intelligent being is caught.
Even  if  the target is hit, he will get another saving throw, not to  resist
the  summoning,  but  to see if he successfully resists the  control  of  the
summoning  wizard. If making that saving throw, he will still appear  at  the
site  of  the  original summoning, but will not be forced to do whatever  the
summoner  demands (not by the spell itself, that is: if facing  some  big-ass
nasty  wizard-type person, you may still want to obey just  so  he  does  not
decide to kill you, but hey, such is life).

This  special spell, is one that assaults the very core of its targets,  both
in mind and body. The spell causes all organs in the body to rupture, and the
mind  to  be  assaulted  by  psychic energies, making  the  mind  essentially
explode.  Those affected will fall to the ground, their minds  aflame,  their
bodies  in wracking pain, as one organ after the other ruptures, and  finally
the mind overloads. The spell can affect all those in sight of the caster  in
some  way or another. Be it through real, physical sight, through the aid  of
such  devices  such  as  a  crystal ball, or a mental  contact  through  ESP,
psionics,  or  other  magical  or  mental  abilities.  The  caster  needs  be
completely aware of where the targets are exactly, and the targets have to be
present on the same plane as the caster resides. The spell can affect as many
levels  or  Hit  Dice as twice that of the caster. If the  caster  has  other
classes  as  well, these will count towards his level at half  effectiveness,
rounded  down,  and be taken into consideration when calculating  the  target
levels (a F17/M19 will count as a 19+(17/2) = 27th-level character).
An  affected  character making its saving throw, will still  be  in  wracking
pain,  and lose half of its hit points, and will be incapacitated (convulsing
on  the  floor) for 26 rounds minus their Constitution, divided  by  two  and
rounded  down.  Thus, a character with 17 Constitution will be  frothing  and
twisting on the ground for 4 rounds.
An  interesting side-effect can be seen by targets who are wizards or priests
or  creatures  who have magical energies stored in some other way  (creatures
with  inherent  magic abilities, breath weapons etc.).  If  they  fail  their
saving throws, during the last seconds before their minds explode, all  these
energies are released in a single burst. DMs should devise their own  effects
for  this on an individual basis, but the effects should not be anything less
than  spectacular,  extremely destructive, and lethal to  anything  near  the
beings so dying.

When  the  wizard  casts  this spell, a fiery glob of  plasma  forms  in  the
caster's hand. The caster can throw this bolt at any target as though he were
a  fighter  of same level. The plasma bolt, when it hits, will stick  to  the
target  inflicting 4d6 points of damage the first round, and  1d6  less  each
consecutive round, until it burns out. The caster, if maintaining  the  spell
(i.e.,  he  does  not  engage any other spell or any other  action  with  his
throwing  hand,  but can still walk or run around, even open  doors  and  the
like,  with his other hand) can grow a new bolt every round up to 1 bolt  per
two  levels.  Note  that the bolt is aflame and extremely warm.  It  can  set
flammable materials aflame and those who are immune to lava and such  extreme
heats  are also immune to the plasma bolts. The only way to stop the  burning
is  by  immersion  in a lot of cold water, or exposure to cones  of  cold  or
similar  magics  (although the target will still receives damage  from  those
spells).  The caster is immune to the effects of his own bolts.  However,  if
the caster is not careful he could set his own clothes aflame. Similarly,  if
the caster is knocked down while having a bolt in his hand, he could fall  on
his own bolt and set himself aflame.

the  candles are burning. One must be placed at every ten foot interval,  and
the  candles  can  be  as  large as the caster can  get  his  hands  on  (for
duration).  While the spell is in effect, no form of magic  or  psionics  can
enter  the  area. Thus, it is impossible to teleport inside, scry, detect  or
whatever. Astral or etherial bodies cannot enter or see into the area, dreams
(sent by dreamers, psionicists or spell throwers) cannot enter either. As far
as any magical effects are concerned the area is simply not there.
Although primarily designed to ward against unwanted intrusions of any  kind,
and  protect  those  in  the area from any unwanted detections,  peeking,  or
spying,  the  spell will also stop the effects of other spells from  entering
the  boundary.  Thus, a fireball cast at the protected area will  simplvanish
where the boundary starts, if already exploded, and the magical fire will not
form  in or cross the barrier. Summoned monsters cannot enter and gates  will
not  form.  However, in combat situations, a small wind  or  the  hand  of  a
creature  needs but to extinguish one candle, and the entire spell  collapses
immediately.

This  spell  is  designed  to  get  rid of  that  pesky  thing  called  magic
resistance. The spell will reduce the target's magic resistance by half.  The
spell  will  only  have  to  overcome half of  the  target's  original  magic
resistance  in  order to function. Multiple spells can be cast  on  the  same
target  for  cumulative effect. I.e. after three successful such spells,  the
target will have only   of their magic resistance left.

      This  spell  is cast on a cloak or similar garment which is embroidered
with  the  personal rune of the wizard. This spell transmutes  the  rune  and
garment  in such a way as to bestow upon the garment an Armour Class increase
of  one,  provided the garment was non-magical before. Thus  a  simple  cloak
would  now  provide  an  AC  9. This is compatible with  other  magic  items,
provided  it  is not the garment itself, nor may more than one  of  the  same
garment be worn at the same time: wearing a cloak of protection, and adding a
cloak  with the rune will not help, but a rune-enspelled cloak would help  if
the wearer also wore rings of protection and bracers of protection.

      This spell can be cast on most cloth worn items, such as sashes, robes,
vests,  tunics, pants, cloaks, mantles etc. It will not work on shoes, boots,
belts,  gloves etc., even if made from cloth. Furthermore, the magic is  such
that  using the spell in conjunction with more than three items at  the  same
time does not further increase the Armour Class of the wizard.

This  spell  creates  a  fiery red glowing rune on the  body  of  the  target
creature.  This  rune allows the recipient to better withstand  fire  of  any
kind.  It  makes the wearer immune to any kind of natural fire.  Furthermore,
the bearer will take only half damage from any other type of fire, none if  a
saving  throw is made (if any is allowed). The bearer is also immune  to  the
effects  of the plane of elemental fire. For more info on runes see Whisper's
rune of protection versus weapons.
Note that runes exist for protection from lightning, acid, and ice or cold as
well. These are essentially exactly the same as above, just adjusted for  the
other  element.  The lightning rune glows blue, acid is black,  ice  or  cold
glowing white.

body.  This rune is a small conduit to the positive material plane. While  in
effect,  the  creature regenerates 2 HP per round, even if the  creature  had
been  slain (i.e., it can bring the creature back to life). The possibilities
of removal are the same as for Whisper's rune of protection versus weapons.

When  this  spell is cast a garish green glowing rune appears on  the  target
creature.  This  rune gives the wearer a magic resistance of 5%.  However,  a
creature's  body is only able to withstand the magic of up to one  such  rune
per  two  Hit Dice or level. Should one cast any more of these runes  onto  a
creature,  every additional rune drains 1 point of Constitution, 1  point  of
Strength  and  2d4  hit  points  per hour  (those  not  rating  Strength  and
Constitution lose 3d4 hit points and have a penalty of -1 to-hit  per  hour).
For  more  information  on  runes see Whisper's  rune  of  protection  versus

Upon casting this spell, a purple glowing rune will appear on the body of the
creature. The rune will have to be traced on the body by the caster,  so  the
place  is  up to the caster. This rune can only be removed if the  caster  so
wishes, someone erases it (cf. the spell with the same name), or a successful
dispel magic or such is cast. While the rune glows on the body of the caster,
the caster is immune to normal weapons as per potion of invulnerability.

This  spell opens a gate to the negative material plane in the centre of  the
spell's area of effect. The area will be enveloped in a hazy, twilight  dark,
where packets of negative energy whiz around. All those in the area of effect
are  hit  for 5d10 points of damage due to these packets. There is  no  known
protection  against  this spell save for magic resistance  or  an  anti-magic
shell. A globe of invulnerability or like magics will not protect the target,
unless  the spell was targeted to centre inside the globe, in which case  the
spell will fail completely. Similarly, should the spell be centred on an anti-
magic shell, it would not work.

This  defensive  spell  should  be cast as a preparatory  spell.  The  wizard
gathers  negative magic energy around him, ready to be released  upon  mental
command.  Whenever a spell is cast, with the caster as specific  target,  the
wizard  can  opt to use the energies of this spell to counter it.  The  spell
works such that the wizard will feel he is being targeted by a spell, and the
general  nature  of the spell. Thus, he will know whether it  is  a  damaging
spell  or  a  divination spell etc. When choosing to counter the  spell,  the
spell cast at the wizard will be blasted, and a fiery explosion of light will
ensue,  into the general direction from which the countered spell  was  cast.
The spell to be countered is not automatically destroyed this way: the caster
of spell blast must roll above the level of the spell to be countered plus 1,
on a 12-sided die.
At  the  DM's option, this spell may have a side-effect. Since the wizard  is
carrying around negative magic energy, this could interfere with the  casting
of other spells, resulting in a 50% - 5% per spell level chance of failure of
such spells.
In  any  case, the spell cannot be held in reserve for more than one day  per
caster  level, and not more than one of these spells can be held at  any  one
time.  The material component of this spell is rare incense, worth  at  least
1000 gp.

This  unpredictable spell attempts to tap energy from the magical plane  that
surrounds  everything directly, and harness that surge in a  manner  that  is
beneficial  to the wizard. The wizard can attempt to keep the gate  open  for
one  round  per  three  levels of experience, however,  the  gate  is  highly
unstable,  and  the following roll will decide for how many rounds  the  gate
will be opened:

     D10 Roll  Number of Rounds Open
     1-2  two rounds less
     3-4  one round less
     5-6  as attempted
     7-8  one round longer
     9-0  two rounds longer

For  every round the gate is open, the wizard regains a previously cast spell
of  a  random level (roll 1d8; no 9th-level spell can be regained this  way).
However, the energies surging into the wizard's body, may do the wizard harm.
For  every  spell regained, the wizard must make an unmodified  saving  throw
versus  breath  weapon  (dual classed or multi-classed characters  must  roll
against their wizard level for this, even if they would gain a better  saving
throw from one of their other classes). If the saving throw fails, the wizard
will get damaged for one hit point per level of the regained spell.
Also,  there  is only a 50% + twice the caster's level chance of opening  the
gate  this  successfully. If the wizard fails this percentage check,  then  a
wild surge will occur. Check the wild surge tables of your liking, or if  you
do  not  have  any, roll on the table for the wand of wonder for what  effect
occurs in stead of this spell.

This  spell  is similar in effect to vampiric touch, except that  the  target
does  not  need be touched. As long as there is an unobstructed path  between
the  target and the caster, the caster can use this spell to drain  the  life
energy  from  another creature. The caster can drain up to  1d6  HP  per  two
caster  levels from the creature, as long as the target creature has the  hit
points to "give". If the target makes its saving throw, then only half of the
previously determined hit point amount is actually drained. Also, there is no
limit to the amount that can be drained level-wise: a 20th-level wizard could
possibly drain 10d6 HP.
A  wizard draining more hit points than he originally has, gains the  drained
hit points anyway, but these excess hit points slowly ebb away at a rate of 1
HP  per round. Damage taken after a drain with excess points, is first  taken
from those excess points.

This  simple,  but  useful spell, when cast, grows  wings  onto  the  casters
shoulders.  These wings are not powerful enough to allow flight, however,  in
combination  with levitation, it essentially does give the user  flight.  The
wings  can  be used to steer the caster sideways at a rate of up  to  12.  To
achieve this speed takes time, however. The wings give an acceleration  of  3
per round. Thus, if the caster is starting out, at the end of the first round
he  will  have  a move of 3, at the end of the second round 6,  etc.  If  the
caster wishes to reverse course, the same rules apply. The first round  slows
down by 3, etc. The material component of the spell is a wing-feather from  a
falcon  or similar hunting bird (note that the spell was developed by a  drow
wizard to augment his natural levitate ability).

This  spell allows the wizard to teleport himself and -70 pounds + 10  pounds
per  level of additional stuff that he is carrying to a specified destination
at  most  150 miles distant. The chances of error are the same as for  normal
teleport, except that if the wizard would normally end up is a solid  object,

When  this spell is cast, a little blob of a sticky, web-like material  flies
toward  it's  target  and completely wraps it in a very strong,  very  sticky
webs. The webs cannot be broken unless the target creature has at least a  23
Strength.
To  determine if the blob hits, roll the attack as if the blob was a  monster
of Hit Dice equal to the wizard's level.
There are 3 applications of this spell:
           as  a glowing sigil drawn in the air by the wizard and pointed  at
the intended target
          as a glyph marked on a surface that is touched or gazed upon
          as a small character written on some magic work to protect it

The  material components of this spell are some strands of web that  a  giant
spider uses to bind up its captured prey.

      This spell, when cast, creates one strand of a very sticky web material
similar  to  the  kind spiders use to wrap up their captured prey.  When  the
strand  hits a creature, the creature is immobilised for the duration of  the
spell.  When the spell wears off, the web-like material ceases to  be  sticky
and the creature can easily escape.

      During the spell, the webs require at least a 21 Strength or better  to
break free, or an edged weapon doing at least 2 points of damage per level of
the wizard. If this is not done carefully then the entangled creature takes _
full  damage if the would be helper misses the webs or half damage if he does
not.  The  webs would take ¬ or half damage respectively. The webs  could  be
more easily burned off but the entrapped creature would take 1d6+1 points  of
damage from the burning webs. For this case, the strands are considered AC 0.

      In  order  for the target creature to be hit, the wizard attacks  as  a
monster of equal Hit Dice. Dexterity bonuses are added to the wizard's  roll,
if any.

      If  the spell misses the target creature, then an other creature behind
the  target  may  be hit (the spell travels in a straight  line  out  to  its
maximum range or until it hits something).

The  material components for this spell are some spider webs which  disappear
when the spell is cast.

This  spell creates a wall of wind. The wall moves forward at a base movement
rate of twice the wizard's level. The wall will rip all loose materials along
with  it.  This  wall  will pull along leaves, papers,  twigs,  small  flying
creatures, loose tapestry, and will cause an opponent to lose balance on a  3
in  6 (depending on size and weight). The wall of wind puts out fires in  its
path  and  will stop nearly any sort of breath weapon or similar area  effect
spell or spell-like effect.
If  cast  in an enclosed area it will cause an explosion (DM's discretion  on
damage).  If cast at a door, it will likely blow the door down and  cause  an
explosion (treat as Strength = level of the wizard). When cast in an enclosed
area, remember that walls and ceilings may collapse and cause further damage.
If  two  walls of wind happen to be cast at each other add the levels of  the
wizards and roll 1d6 per level for damage as an explosion reducing in  damage
by 10 hit points per 5 feet from impact.
The  wall  of  wind will last for 1 round per four levels of the wizard.  The
material  component  for this spell is a fan, which is not  consumed  in  the
casting.

Despite  the name of this spell, wind burn has nothing to do with fire.  Upon
casting, the priest causes an exceptionally dry cone of air to originate from
his  hand. The cone is 5 inches in diameter at its base, 25 feet in  diameter
at  its  end,  and  75 feet long. All targets of the spell must  save  versus
spell.  Those who fail suffer 1d6 points of dehydration damage per  level  of
the  caster as well as a temporary loss of 1 point of Constitution (creatures
without  Constitution  scores  suffer  a   1  penalty  to  Armour  Class).  A
successful  saving  throw  means half damage and  no  loss  of  Constitution.
Creatures exceptionally susceptible to dehydration damage (for example, those
from  the  elemental  plane  of  water,  plant  creatures,  or  even  aquatic
creatures) suffer a  4 penalty to their saving throw. Constitution point loss
is  cumulative; that is to say, if a target of two of these spells  fails  to
save against both it will suffer a  2 to its Constitution (if it survives the
damage, of course). A character is dead if his Constitution reaches zero (for
creatures  without Constitution, use Hit Dice; thus, even if a 3  HD  monster
had  enough hit points to survive failing to save 3 times, it would still die
since 3 3=0).
Constitution points may only be restored by consumption of a full day's water
requirement (use the Dark Sun rehydration rules; or simply 1 gallon  per  day
for a human sized creature). This spell is cannot be cast under water.

By  use  of this spell, the wizard creates a cylindrical tunnel of  wind  ten
feet directly in front of the wizard, ten feet in diameter, and stretching 10
feet  per  level in length. As long as the wizard maintains concentration  on
the  spell, the tunnel's primary section will be under the wizard's  control.
Once  concentration is broken, however, it cannot be retained, and the tunnel
will move and grow in a random fashion for the spell's duration, which cannot
be  shortened. The tunnel is capable of moving 10 feet per round and  growing
at  both ends at the same rate. If it splits into parts due to this movement,
it will grow at all loose ends for the duration of the spell.
The  wizard  and  designated friends may pass through the  controlled  tunnel
unscathed.  Others, however, must make Strength checks to avoid being  pulled
into the tunnel, make melee attacks at -2, and may take a point of damage per
round  from  loose sand, dirt, or pebbles. While in the tunnel,  missile  and
hurled  attacks  are made at -5. Such attacks through the tunnel  "skin"  are
next  to impossible. Note that the wizard may walk, communicate non-verbally,
and  still maintain control, however if the wizard is hit or distracted, then
control is lost. The material component for this spell is a fan.

This spell causes large wings to grow on the back of the priest, allowing him
to  fly  as per the wizard spell fly. The spell is not affected by armour  of
any sort (the wings will grow through the armour, and the armour will not  be
destroyed). If the deity is good aligned, the wings are white, angel-like; if
he is evil, they will be black, devil-like. Druids grow eagle-like wings, and
other neutral deities grant grey feather-wings.
Normally, this spell may only be cast on the followers of the same god as the
priest.  However,  in  dire need it may be cast on any  person.  If  cast  on
another  person  under circumstances that are not "dire",  the  priest  loses
access  to  the spell for two days. The material components are the  priest's
holy  symbol, plus an eagle's feather for druids, a white feather  for  good,
any  feather for neutral and a bat wing for evil priests. The components  may
be reused.
Note that God in the title of this spell should be changed to the name of the
priest's god.

By  this  spell,  the  wizard causes "wings" to appear out  of  the  affected
creature's back. The wings are magically attached to the back area,  but  are
not  attached in the sense that the person can be wearing clothing or armour.
They are not part of the creature. The wings need a +1 magical weapon to hit,
have AC 7 and have 2d6 HP before being destroyed. The spell has no effect  on
creatures that already have wings. If there is no room for the wings to grow,
for example because of clothing, the spell is lost.
The  wings can support a total of 200 pounds + 20 pounds per level. They give
an aerial manoeuvre rating of C, and fly at a rate of 12.

The material component of this spell is a bird's feather. The wings appear to
be the same colour as that of the bird feather used in the spell.

     D8 Roll   Type of Party  Drink Conjured
     1    Kid's birthday party     Very sweet cordial
     2    Barbecue  Dark beer
     3    Frat party     Very low quality beer
     4    Pizza party    Soda, assorted flavours
     5    Society gathering   Fine wine
     6    Ice-cream sundae party   Root beer, soda water
     7    Hacking party  Jolt cola
     8    Celebration party   Champagne

The DM should feel free to substitute any other party drinks. Each cubic foot
of the drink refreshes four human sized creatures or one horse sized creature
for  a  half  day.  The liquid decays and becomes inedible within  24  hours,
although it can be restored for another 12 hours by casting a purify food and
drink  on  it. For each experience level the priest has obtained,  one  cubic
foot  of drink will be created by the spell. A 2nd-level priest could  create
two cubic feet of drink.

When  this  spell is cast, the priest causes party food and  party  drink  to
appear.  To  determine the food conjured, roll 1d6 and  check  on  the  table
below:

     D6 Roll   Type of Party  Food Summoned
      1    Kid's birthday party     Very sweet cordial, birthday cake, potato
chips, chex mix, hotdish
      2     Barbecue   Dark beer, brauts hamburgers, buns, egg salad,  potato

     3    Frat party     Very low quality beer, popcorn, peanuts
     4    Pizza party    Soda, assorted flavours, pizza
      5     Society  gathering   Fine wine, shrimp, little sandwiches,  brie,
crackers, assorted appetizers
      6     Ice-cream sundae party   Root beer, soda water, assorted flavours
of ice cream, lots of toppings

The  DM should feel free to substitute any other party foods and drinks. Each
cubic  foot of the material sustains four human sized creatures or one  horse
sized creature for a full day. The food decays and becomes inedible within 12
hours, although it can be restored for another 6 hours by casting purify food
and  drink  on  it.  The liquid produced by this spell is the  same  as  that
created  by  the 1st-level priest spell Winston's create party drink  (q.v.).
For  each  experience level the priest has obtained, one half cubic  foot  of
food  and drink will be created by the spell. A 2nd-level priest could create
one cubic foot of food and one cubic foot of drink.

This  spell enables the spell caster to change self into any undead  creature
of  Hit Dice equal to or lower than the caster's level. The spell caster must
have  intimate knowledge of the undead, either frequent combat  or  study  of
natural philosophy thereof. Unlike polymorph self, however, the spell  caster
attains  all powers of the undead creature. The caster retains their original
mind  and  personality but loses use of the classes that they are trained  in
while  transmogrified.  That  is, he cannot cast  their  spells,  cannot  use
fighter tables, etc.

This spell is like monster summoning, except that the spell is forgotten when
the  caster  learns a higher-powered version of the spell.  This  causes  the
caster  to  lose  the ability to cast this lower-level version  and  it  even
disappears  from  his spellbook (this spell is normally  transcribed  from  a
scroll). Either 2d6 skeletons or 2d4 zombies may be summoned.
The  undead appear at the end of the casting and fight to the best  of  their
ability  until slain, the duration expires, they are released,  or  they  are
further than 30 yards from the caster (the caster may not intentionally  move
out of range, nor may the undead for they are not free-willed while under the
spell). At such time, they return to their point of origination.

The material component is a lit candle inside a small bag.

This spell creates a special version of the wizard's wizard mark to be placed
in  a  room of the wizard's choice. This sigil will allow the wizard to  view
the room from any distance as if the wizard was scrying into the room with no
chance  of  failure.  The sigil itself does not do the seeing,  but  it  only
defines  the room that can be viewed, thus the wizard can view the room  from
any viewpoint inside the room, but not from outside the room. The information
received is limited to visual only.
Since the sigil is easily noticed, it can be hidden, or have its design mixed
in with the decor of the room and be hidden that way.
If  the  sigil is created in an outside area, not bounded by walls, then  the
viewpoint  can be anywhere within a 10-yard radius from the location  of  the
sigil.
Any  creatures that are in the room which is actively being watched will have
a  chance  to detect the scrying of the owner as defined the Dungeon Master's
Guide,  page 141. If they use dispel magic to counter the scrying,  then  the
sigil  will  remain inoperative for a period of one day (this does  not  mean
that  the  wizard  might not have more sigils in the room. As  long  as  they
remain inactivated, they will not be affected by the dispel magic).
The spell is permanent until the sigil is tampered with, or destroyed.

The  material  components for this spell are mercury and  1000  gp  worth  of
carbuncle dust, mixed to form a glue base as well as a dragon scale with  the
sigil  carved  on  it. The mix is poured onto the dragon  scale  "mould"  and
pressed against the area where the sigil is to be put. The spell is cast, and
the new sigil remains in place.

When  cast, a loud, booming representation of the wizard's voice is projected
to  any  point within range. The wizard may speak anything desired, up  to  2
words per level of the caster. Spells may not be cast through wizard's voice,
but  command words for previously placed magic are allowed, at the discretion
of  the  DM.  Normally, however, wizard's voice is used to warn intruders  of
their lack of Wisdom, or to call apprentices to their presence for additional
chores.

The  material component for wizard's voice is a small glass jar,  into  which
the caster must speak, seal and immediately smash underfoot.

This  spell  requires the presence of any piercing melee weapon in  order  to
work;  the  wizard holds the weapon, and when the incantations are  complete,
the  weapon  vanishes  and reappears in the hands of  an  invisible  spectral
creature. True seeing, detect invisibility, or similar magics will reveal the
vague  outline of a figure; others will only see the weapon hovering  in  the
air.
The  figure (and weapon) will appear behind the creature chosen as the target
for  this spell (the target must be within spell range); it will then deliver
an instantaneous backstab at the victim. The wizard's normal THAC0 is used to
resolved hits (all applicable bonuses apply normally, including the bonus for
attacking from behind); the attack is always made with surprise (unless it is
normally  impossible  to  surprise the target) and therefore,  Dexterity  and
shield bonuses to Armour Class do not apply to the attack.
In the case of a successful hit, the base damage is as per the weapon used in
the  attack; however the attack also receives a backstab damage bonus  as  if
made by a thief of a level equal to the wizard's level; normal damage bonuses
also apply to the attack.
The  only material component for this spell is the weapon used in the attack;
this weapon, as well as the spectral creature, disappears after the attack is
made, whether it was successful or not.

This spell creates an illusionary creature in the mind of its victim much the
same as a phantasmal killer. The fearstalker appears as a shadowy creature of
a  vaguely  humanoid  shape  (only the victim and  the  wizard  can  see  the
creature).  Once cast, the fearstalker will tirelessly pursue its target;  if
the victim does not succeed in making a disbelieve check (this intent must be
specifically stated) it will be attacked by the fearstalker.
The  fearstalker has a movement rate of 24, has Hit Dice equal  to  half  the
wizard's  level (rounded down), has 2 attacks (2d6/2d6), and can be hit  only
by  +1  or  better  weapons. It is immune to charms and other  mind-affecting
spells, but is susceptible to most other spells and magic attacks.
Once  the  battle has been joined, nothing short of the death of one  of  the
combatants  will end it. Rendering the victim unconscious will not  help,  as
the  fearstalker will enter the target's dreams and the battle will  continue
normally.  If  the caster of the spell is slain or rendered unconscious,  the
current  battle will continue normally, but the fearstalker will not be  able
to return at a later time (see below).
If  the  victim of this spell is reduced to 0 HP by the fearstalker, he  must
make  a systems shock roll; if this roll fails, the victim dies and the spell
ends;  if it succeeds, the target only believes he has died and falls into  a
coma  for 2d12 hours. Only heal or wish will rouse the victim from this coma.
If  the  target  reduces the fearstalker to 0 HP, it will  vanish  instantly.
However,  in  this case, the fearstalker is not actually destroyed;  it  will
reappear  in  4d6  hours (at full strength) to again attack its  victim  (the
fearstalker is not able to return if the wizard has been slain, or if he  was
unconscious at the time of the fearstalker's defeat in the previous battle).
The  only way to permanently end this spell (short of the victim's death)  is
to  make  a successful disbelieve check. The victim is allowed one such  roll
each  time the fearstalker returns after being defeated, as well as when  the
spell is first cast. This disbelieve check has the same modifiers applied  to
it as for the phantasmal killer spell.
The  wearer  of  a  helm of telepathy may not turn the fearstalker  upon  the
wizard. If the victim is asleep or otherwise unconscious when the fearstalker
returns,  the  battle  will  take  place in  the  target's  dreams,  and  the
disbelieve check is made with a -2 penalty.

This spell is designed to help heal the mind of fears, especially illusionary
or phantasmal fears, and other magical ones.
When  cast, the creature affected by fear sees a wondrous pattern  of  images
and  lights  that  begin to suffuse his being, until eventually  he  believes
himself  to be some armoured hero. The effect lasts until the wizards dispels
it, or until the duration expires.
The  effects  of  this  spell allow the creature an  automatic  saving  throw
against fear effects. It also allows him to disbelieve a phantasmal force and
grants a +4 saving throw per round against phantasmal killer. If the affected
creature moves out of the spell's range, the effects wear off and he  returns
to  his original state of mind. Also, the affected creature is gains a +2 to-
hit and to damage in the first three rounds, due to his new-found valour.

The material component is any light source, which is not extinguished, but  a
continual light or light is not sufficient.

By use of this spell, the priest causes a passage five feet in diameter to be
bored into any single non-living substance. The passage will extend ten  feet
per  level  of the priest, and may be closed behind the priest or allowed  to
exist  for the duration of the spell. Note that stone, metal, water, gas,  or
even  fire  are  affected, though magical substances,  sanctified  areas  and
magically  locked  objects cannot be penetrated. The material  component  for
this spell is an awl, which is consumed in the casting.

"A  worm  never forgets", the saying goes. While this  is  a  well
known  saying,  few  people know its origins, with  the  Spineless
Worm.  This worm, once it lives in a place for just one day,  will
always remember it, and will return there no matter where you  put
it.  In fact, if kept at a new location for a day or more, it will
remember  this new place too, and when released, will retrace  the
way  between all such places. It's not known what drives the  worm
to return to the places it knows, but as this power has to do with
recalling  old memories, the name seemed to fit. As a  side  note,
"you're  a  spineless  worm" is a phrase of respect  reserved  for
learned scholars, with vast knowledge of many subjects.  The  Worm
Drive  power  is actually a collection of three related  powers  -
Install,  Read  and Write. The names have some historical  meaning
which  has been lost with time. To use Worm Drive, one must  first
use Install. This creates a new organ - a kind of sub-brain, which
can  store  memories. The creation of this organ, like  any  other
massive  change  to  the  body,  can  cause  massive  stress.  The
psionicist must make a system shock roll. If he fails,  the  power
fails,  and the psionicist passes out for 2d6 turns.  Once Install
has been used, the psionicist can Write (store) memories, and then
Read  (recall)  them.  To  Write a  memory,  the  psionicist  must
concentrate  for  one round on the memory to be stored,  and  then
invoke the power. To recall a memory, the psionicist activates the
Read version of the power.
      There  are  two  basic  ways to  recall  a  memory.  If  the
psionicist knows what he wants to remember, but just doesn't  know
the  details,  he thinks about what he wants to recall,  and  then
activates  the  power. The other way is to go over  the  memories,
from the last to the first. The psionicist can browse memories  at
about ten per round, getting only a vague idea of what each memory
holds.  Once  he finds the memory he wants, he can  get  the  full
details. The memory is then vividly recalled.
      Browsing memories costs one PSP per memory. Once the  memory
is  recalled,  holding it vivid in memory costs 1 PSP  per  round.
Once  maintenance is stopped, the memory fades away over the  next
turn,  until  the  psionicist can only  remember  the  details  he
remembered  before  invoking  the power.   The  psionicist  cannot
browse,  recall,  and then browse again, without reactivating  the
power  and making another power check.  Note that memories  stored
with  Worm  Drive  are  not affected by mind affecting  spells  or
psionic  powers, so, for example, a Forget spell  won't  affect  a
stored  memory, even if this memory is of an event which  occurred
during the time span affected by the spell. Often psionicists  who
have access to this science, and feel that they have been affected
by  a memory erasing power, automatically activate Worm Drive  and
browse memories, recalling those they can't remember.

Power Score:
InstallDthe system shock roll automatically succeeds.

WriteDno special effect.

ReadDfull details of the memory are kept in the psionicist's  mind
for  a  turn without need for maintenance, and only then start  to

20:
InstallDa large blob of flesh grows somewhere on the body  of  the
psionicist,  and  in addition the psionicist passes  out  for  2d6
turns.  One  way to remove the blob is to cut is off, causing  3d6
points of damage.  When healed, the body will return to its normal
shape.

This  spell  closes  the  wounds of the recipient  to  prevent  bleeding  and
infection,  incidentally curing 1d4 points of damage.  All  of  the  victim's
wounds  will  be  closed  by  a single casting, but  further  application  is
possible to increase the healing effect. The spell can be used on corpses  to
disguise the cause of death, but it does not work on non-corporeal or  extra-
planar entities.
Note:  a recent posting suggested that wizards should be able to cast healing
spells using 1d6 instead of 1d8. I believe the above spell description  shows
my  opposition  to that approach (see also the Dungeon Master's  Guide,  page
43),  unless  you intend to do away with priests as a PC class. From  a  game
mechanics  standpoint,  such an approach would destroy  the  balance  between
priest and wizard, but there is a campaign background reason as well: pseudo-
medieval medical knowledge would be atrocious. A priest's healing is  a  gift
from  God  or  the  gods, relatively omniscient and omnipotent  fellows,  but
magical  curing would depend upon the wizard's understanding of the body  and
its functions. Thus you might find a wizard who can pull the edges of a wound
back  together,  as  described above, but you could not find  one  who  could
stimulate  the  replication of tissue of various injured  organs,  insure  an
increased  blood supply to the affected regions, metabolise fat and  increase
respiration to enrich said blood, etc. You certainly could not find a  wizard
to cure diseases before any microbes are discovered.

The priest and all carried gear become para-ethereal, and an aura of negative
energy surrounds the priest. The priest can only be struck by magical weapons
or  by  silver weapons for half-damage and is treated as gaseous for movement
purposes. Undead will not recognize the priest as a living being unless  they
are  of  higher  status and Intelligence in which case they may  save  versus
death  magic  at  -4 in order to recognize the necromancer for  what  he  is.
Living creatures suffer 1d6 damage on touch (which is the priests only attack
on  non-ethereal creatures during the spell duration). The priest may  negate
the  effects of the spell at will, but will appear to non-ethereal  creatures
as  a  shadowy,  smoky, semi-transparent ghost and will take 1d6  damage  per
round  from  sunlight.  Note that this spell may be  cast  only  from  planes
adjacent to the ethereal (those being the primes and the surface of the inner
sphere).  The priest is not affected by normal winds. The material  component
for this spell is a bit of cotton wool.

substances which are impenetrable to normal sight. Vision range is  20  feet,

The  casting of this spell allows the wizard to filter any leaves out of  his
vision  for  the spells duration. The leaves are treated as if  they  weren't
present  only for vision purposes. Spells that require a line of  sight  will

This  spell  was developed after one too many forest ambushes. Note  that  it
will not detect invisible creatures, only those using natural cover.

Yemelat, whose archbishopric is among the most coveted of all the dioceses of
Lord  Priapus, is most famous for his orgiastic frenzy spell,  first  put  to
shockingly  great  effect at a special High Council of the priests  of  Helm,
Torm,  and Tyr. This spell compels those within its range to engage in sexual
activities  with wild abandon with anyone else within the zone. Those  within
the  area  of  effect may save versus petrification at  5 to  stave  off  the
effects,  but must save again if they touch anyone or anything in  the  zone,
until  they  escape the zone or until everyone falls unconscious  within  the
zone. The material component is a peeled grape.

This  spell removes 10% of the current age of a touched subject. A successful
saving throw negates this.
The reverse of this spell, older, adds four months per level of the caster to
the  current age of a touched subject. A successful saving throw versus spell
halves the time aged.
This  spell  was written for the "time spirit" class. Contact the author  for

This spell reduces the physiological age of the recipient by 2d6+6 years. The
recipient  must  make  a saving throw versus death magic  for  the  spell  to
succeed. If the saving throw is failed, the spell is ruined. A fumbled saving
throw  (a natural roll of 1) results in the recipient being aged 2d6+6 years.
Only the recipient's natural saving throw is used in this roll.

The  material  component is a quarter pint of dragon  blood,  and  1000  gold
pieces  worth  of  gems  per  year  of time  the  recipient  has  lived  (his
chronological age). The recipient must be willing for the spell to work.

The  spell will cause oneself or another to gain up to 10 years of youth. The
spell  effects depend on how long the spell is studied. If interrupted during
study, the spell will be lost. The spell can also heal old scars or heal body
parts that were lost in the past, such as eyes, ears, etc.
However,  the  spell must be studied to the maximum to get  all  results.  If
studied  for 1 week without any interruptions the caster can even bring  back
old  limbs. This spell will not heal anyone that was born without arms, eyes,
etc. Youth spell effects:

By  means of this spell, the wizard changes the target creature, effectively,
inside  out.  The  organs are outside the body and the skin is  inside.  DMs:
insert  your own really graphic descriptions here... The wizard must  have  a
small  leather pouch for the casting. At the end of the casting,  the  wizard
thrusts his hand into the bag and violently pulls the bag inside out. Now the
target  is  either painfully turned inside out, or the wizard  looks  like  a
tfool.  The  spell  affects one medium size creature or two small  creatures.
Large creatures receive a +3 to their saving throw.
Note that clothing, armour, etc. are in the inside also.

This  spell is a more powerful version of identify. The wizard may  read  one
"plus" cast on the item per round, as well as one special effect per 2 rounds
(a  +5  sword requires 5 rounds to read; a flame tongue requires 9 rounds:  1
for  the  base plus, 2 for flaming and 3x2 = 6 for variable effects). Effects
upon  the wizard are as for the Identify spell. It will not reveal the  exact
Intelligence and ego of a sentient weapon, but may reveal some of its powers.

The  material component of this spell is a gem of no less than 1000 gp value.
Used  in combination with legend lore, it may identify almost anything  short
of artifacts and relics.
If tspell is to be used by an NPC, employed to identify an item, it will cost
15,000 gp.

This  spell creates 1d4 pebbles, plus 1 pebble per level, up to a maximum  of
1d4+12 at twelfth level. Each pebble counts as one attack regarding stoneskin
spells. To be successful, the wizard must simultaneously hurl the pebbles  at
the  target, and roll a successful attack roll against AC 10 with a +4  added
to  the  die  roll for this to have effect. No modifiers for  range,  magical
protection  or  Dexterity  are  applicable.  Each  pebble  will  remove   one
stoneskin, and no saving throw is allowed.
If  used  against an opponent without a stoneskin cast on him, an  unmodified
attack  roll  against the target's Armour Class is required.  If  successful,
each pebble will inflict but one hit point of damage, and a successful saving
throw versus spell reducethis to half damage, the total rounded down.
If  the spell creates more pebbles than the target has stoneskins, the  extra
pebbles are lost, not inflicting any damage.

The  material  components are a pebble or sling stone to  be  multiplied  and
hurled towards the target.

Zildjian's  energy field is a spell similar to the various  Wall  spells  and
also  to the various Otiluke's screens. The spell creates a shimmering energy
field. The field can be between 1 and 10 feet thick and encompasses up to  10
square  feet  per level of the spell caster. The spell caster  specifies  the
dimensions and may adjust them to fit the required area, but with  a  minimum
of  1  foot on each side. At least one side of the field must contact a solid
or  liquid  surface, though not necessary the bottom side. All of the  energy
fields   are   permanent,  unless  dispelled,  disintegrated,   anti-magiced,
cancelled or annihilated. The spell caster can also bring them down at  will,
either permanently or for a specified amount of time. A knock spell cast by a
magic-user  four  or more levels higher than the original caster  will  bring
down  the  field for 1 round (cf. wizard lock). The four different  types  of
fields and their effects are noted below.
Violet  Field - This field causes a more powerful version of the sleep  spell
to  affect anyone coming in contact with the field. All creatures with up  to
10  HD  are immediately put to sleep for 1 turn per level of the spellcaster,
no  saving throw. All creatures with over 10 HD are immune to this  spell  as
are  undead  and creatures that never sleep (DM's discretion).  The  material
component for this field is a small amount of sand sprinkled as the spell  is
cast.
Red  Field  - This field is a searing wall of flames, doing 1d4+2  points  of
damage  per level of the spell caster to any who come in contact with  it.  A
successful saving throw versus spell reduces the damage to half. The material
component  for this field is a small vial of flammable oil. If oil  of  fiery
burning  is used as the material component, the damage becomes 1d6+2  HP  per
level.
Green  Field  -  This field is a wall of poisonous energy. All  who  come  in
contact with this field must save versus poison or be affected by the  field.
The  precise  effects  depend  on the type of poison  used  as  the  material
component.  The  spell  requires 3 drops of  any  poison.  All  saving  throw
modifiers are added on for particularity weak or deadly poisons.
Blue  Field  -  This protective field acts as a wall of force  in  preventing
anything from penetrating it and further does 1d4 points of electrical damage
per  level  of  the caster to anyone touching it. Characters in metal  armour
take  one  additional hit point per die of damage. A successful saving  throw
reduces the damage by half.

The material components are a small glass bead and a bit of fur.

This  spell is much like the 4th-level Rary's mnemonic enhancer, except  that
the  magic-user  is able to memorise, or retain the memory of,  up  to  seven
additional  spell levels (seven 1st-level spells, or one 1st- and three  2nd-

Zildjian's  spellnet allows the magic-user to prepare a selection  of  spells
able to be cast at a moment's notice. The casting of the spell creates a non-
dimensional energy-space field, in which spells may be held until needed. The
caster then places any spells into the spellnet he wishes to store by casting
the entire spell except for saying the last word. All material components are
consumed  at the time of placing the spell in the spellnet. When  the  magic-
user  desires  to call up spells stored in the spellnet, he merely  completes
the  final  verbal  components of the spell. This action  has  an  initiative
modifier  ("casting time") of only 1, no matter which spell is  being  called
up.  Unlike normal spellcasting which may be disrupted if the spellcaster  is
attacked, calling up spells out of the spellnet is possible in all situations
where activating a magic item by a command word would be possible. The wizard
Zildjian  specifically designed this feature to be the bane of the  organized
"hit  the  magic-user before he can cast a spell" type of  fighters.  Magical
silence  will stop the use of the spell, but a vocalize spell will allow  the
spells  to  be called up via somatic components rather than the final  verbal
ones.  The  maximum  number  of spell levels  that  a  caster  may  place  in
Zildjian's spellnet is equal to his level as a wizard (for example,  a  14th-
level wizard could place two 5th-level spells and one 4th-level spell in  the
spellnet,  or  two 7th-level spells, or any other combination that  does  not
exceed  his level). The initial casting of the spell takes one hour plus  the
casting times of the individual spells to be entered. The spellnet and stored
spells  then last in the non-dimensional energy field for 1 day per level  of
the  caster. After this time limit, the spellnet begins to decay and  by  the
end  of  the last day will be completely gone along with all remaining spells
held in it. The spellnet may be restored at any time prior to the last day by
casting  of  another spellnet to "recharge" it. This "recharging" takes  only
one  turn,  rather  than  the  one  hour needed  to  create  it.  During  the
"recharging" new spells may be added to replace any lost spells,  up  to  the
maximum  stated above. This is the only time that replacement spells  may  be
added or spell selection in the spellnet changed. Spells held in the spellnet
are  considered  cast  for purposes of memorisation of  new  spells,  thus  a
temporary increase in the amount of spells available is possible.
Certain other spells, magic items and conditions may cause interference  with
Zildjian's  spellnet. First, no two spellnets may be up at the same  time  on
the  same  wizard.  If  the wizard attempts to put a second  spellnet  up  on
himself,  both are destroyed, the wizard loses all memorised spells  for  the
day and is stunned for 1d4 rounds. Should one wizard attempt to cast a second
spellnet  on another wizard as an attack, then both wizards must save  versus
spell  at -4 or each will be affected as above. If the saving throw is  made,
the second spellnet is destroyed. The spellnet and a mnemonic enhancer cannot
be  active on the same magic-user at the same time. The spellnet is destroyed
if cast on a magic-user with a mnemonic enhancer up or if a mnemonic enhancer
or a lucubration is cast on a magic-user with Zildjian's spellnet up. Forget,
feeblemind,  confusion,  insanity or psionics may cause  the  wizard  not  to
remember which spells are in the spellnet, but do not directly affect  it.  A
successful magic jar or other type of possession causes instant decay of  the
spell,  as  the  spellnet requires that the mind reside in the  body  of  the
spellcaster. Dispel magic, holy word, Mordenkainen's disjunction  or  passing
through  an  anti-magic shell will cause the instant decay of  the  spellnet,
unless  it  is  immediately  recharged as per the  method  given  above.  The
spellnet  will  not  function in any area where a non-dimensional  or  extra-
dimensional  space will not function (i.e. the astral plane, or in  the  area
created  by  a  rope trick, Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion,  major  ward,
prismatic sphere or cube of force), but it is not destroyed by the  area  and
can be accessed again once the area is left, unless the duration has expired.
The  spellnet  will be destroyed by the wearing or using of a ring  of  spell
storing, ring of wizardry, rod of absorption (casting spells only, absorption
causes no problems), helm of teleportation (refreshing memory option), purple
ioun stone (spell storing one), pearl of power, robe of powerlessness, or  in
general any other memory enhancing or spell storing item or spell.
Finally, should the caster be so foolish as to climb inside a bag of holding,
bag  of devouring, or portable hole with a spellnet up, a terrible thing will
happen. The caster will be affected as is normal for the placing of an extra-
dimensional space in a non-dimensional space. Specifically, if the caster  is
in  a bag of holding, the effects will be as if the caster is a portable hole
(i.e.:  a gate to another plane). And vice-versa, if the caster climbs  in  a
portable hole (i.e. a rift to the astral plane).

The  material  components for this spell are a sheet of vellum  suitable  for
inscribing  magical  spells,  an  ounce of  squid  ink,  again  suitable  for
inscribing spells, a pinch of diamond dust and an optional small crystal. All
are  consumed upon the creation or recharging of the spellnet, except for the
crystal  which remains and glows in proportion to the remaining  duration  of
the spellnet.

This  is  an  unusual  spell for the simple reason that  wizards  don't  like
psionicists   (they  would  however,  like  the  reverse:  Zodiac's   psionic
restriction). This wizard spell can boost (or reduce) PSPs. The total can  be
raised above the normal maximum. At any rate, the bestowed PSPs disperse at 1
PSP  per  2 rounds. Therefore, the bonus is short lived, so use it  fast.  It
starts  to  drain  away  the round after casting. This spell  involves  great
concentration  and is a drain on the wizard. 3 PSPs are given  for  each  hit
point the spellcaster is willing to "cannibalize".
The  reverse, zodiac's psionic restriction, drains PSPs at the rate of 3 PSPs
per  level  per round. The duration is 1 round per 2 levels. A  saving  throw
(adjusted for Wisdom) may be made each round the effect is applied.
The  caster can do very little while this spell is in effect. No spellcasting
is  possible. The caster may move at half his movement rate while this  spell
is in effect. A 20 Wisdom gives immunity to this spell.
This  spell was created by Zodiac. Zoe was an astrologer who later  became  a
psionicist. After a near-death experience (involving illithids), she  devoted
her  life to her god. As an ascetic, she still used her psionic talents.  She
researched this spell to allow herself to enhance her previous abilities.

Blowing dust into the 20-foot cubic area causes all creatures in area to save
versus  spell or automatically lose initiative rolls for the duration of  the
spell.  If  individual initiative is used treat this as a +20 on  initiative.
The  material component is zombie dust: the dust of zombies that have  turned
dead  once  again.  The ability to breath has no effect  on  this  spell:  it
operates by magic, not by inhalation.

This  spell  is  used by a priest to create an area in which  alcohol  has  a
diminished  effect  on creatures. Any being entering the  area  must  make  a
saving  throw versus spell to overcome the compulsion not to drink. Creatures
entering  the  area already intoxicated will have their level of intoxication
reduced  by  one  level  (note that this sobers up  those  who  are  slightly
intoxicated). Constitution checks made in the area are unmodified, no  matter
what is being imbibed, thus making it more difficult to become drunk (see the
Net Alcohol Guide for more information).
The  reverse, zone of intoxication, creates an area in which alcohol is  more
effective than normal. Any being entering the area must save versus spell  or
be compelled to drink. Creatures entering the area will become one level more
intoxicated  than  they  were (not more than greatly intoxicated,  and  sober
creatures  are  unaffected by this). Constitution checks are  made  at  a   3
penalty, cumulative with other penalties, making it easier to become drunk.
This  spell  is  popular amongst priests who assist temperance organizations.
The   reverse  is  popular  amongst  business  owners  who  enjoy  the  large
consumption of alcohol. Of course, they must find priests willing to help the
business.  Most priests will cast the spell for a small contribution  to  the
church.
The material component of the spell is a sea sponge with a serving of alcohol
sucked into it.
